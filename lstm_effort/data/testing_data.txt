marge simpson|like queen elizabeth the first !
marge simpson|she had it all , except the most important thing .
marge simpson|no , a husband !
marge simpson|the year was 1588 .
marge simpson|four hundred years before kirk gibson would hit his famous home run .
marge simpson|queen elizabeth ruled over all of england .
marge simpson|every eligible bachelor in europe wanted her hand in marriage .
marge simpson|lisa , you are going to look so pretty .

marge simpson|a sixfeetunderstudy .
marge simpson|tonight the springfield community playhouse was bathed in the light of a brilliant new star ...
marge simpson|dr hibbert as banquo ?

marge simpson|which makes him the next one you've got to kill .
marge simpson|screw your courage to the stickingplace and we'll not fail .
marge simpson|macbeth !
marge simpson|all i heard was more names of actors you haven't killed .

marge simpson|no , it was homer !
marge simpson|no , i just encouraged him .
marge simpson|oh homie , you were brilliant .

marge simpson|maggie's genius and creativity far exceeded that of the others .
marge simpson|and i'm not just saying that 'cause i'm her mother .
marge simpson|but her teacher , mr ellsworth toohey , wanted every child to conform .
marge simpson|maggie grew up to be a worldfamous architect .
marge simpson|her building became one of the wonders of the world .
marge simpson|and on the very top floor was a daycare center ...
marge simpson|where every child was free to follow their dream .
marge simpson|because nothing is ...

marge simpson|bart simpson !
marge simpson|i'm glad your father isn't here to see this !
marge simpson|bart , let him go !

marge simpson|that was so noble of apu to give his life for us .
marge simpson|i don't see the safe zone anywhere .

marge simpson|i once swept red wine off a white carpet .
marge simpson|if homer can join with me .
marge simpson|so we'd just thrown a biter , and homer said to kick harder off the hack .
marge simpson|so i did ...
marge simpson|and i almost fouled the hog line !
marge simpson|the realest thing i've ever done .
marge simpson|hey , look who slid into our house .
marge simpson|what's up , seymour ?
marge simpson|he usually stays out like this for about thirty seconds .

marge simpson|you love your son .
marge simpson|how can you be so hard on him ?
marge simpson|well , they should .
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|we're going to vancouver !
marge simpson|homer , who's that ?
marge simpson|my favorite subject .
marge simpson|i'll go first .
marge simpson|isn't he cute ?
marge simpson|but homer tries his best .
marge simpson|well who made you the coach ?
marge simpson|well , homer's my soul mate !
marge simpson|and you don't dump a soul mate !
marge simpson|i like to warm up by sweeping behind the snack bar .
marge simpson|boo yeah !
marge simpson|yes it will .
marge simpson|i'll just sweep harder than anyone's ever swept before .
marge simpson|because without homer i'm a broom without a stone .
marge simpson|no use for anything .
marge simpson|c'mon , baby !
marge simpson|i'm not horny , i'm mad .
marge simpson|i should be , i'm lefthanded .
marge simpson|no surrender !
marge simpson|let's give the olympics a miracle !

marge simpson|bart , what are you doing for black history month ?
marge simpson|what happened next ?
marge simpson|cheer up , sweetie .
marge simpson|maybe we can find the answer in the library !
marge simpson|oooh , a cookbook !
marge simpson|this one doesn't sound roadkilly .
marge simpson|and , it comes with a story .
marge simpson|the patrollers were too fast for eliza and virgil ...
marge simpson|where they were helped by a crusty old clown .
marge simpson|, 639000 , true , 1 , 3699 , marge simpson , traveling circus , ...
marge simpson|where they were helped by a crusty old clown .
marge simpson|it was a footnote .
marge simpson|see ?
marge simpson|i don't know what the big deal is .
marge simpson|i mean , it never bothered any of you that my father's french .
marge simpson|you know , bouvier ?
marge simpson|i'm french , not you .

marge simpson|no school today .
marge simpson|then again , there's only one way to get a truly accurate reading .
marge simpson|bart , pants .
marge simpson|yup .
marge simpson|oneohthree on the dot .
marge simpson|you're stayin' home .
marge simpson|one month ?
marge simpson|that's a heavy workload for a fourth grader .
marge simpson|thanks for doing the dishes .
marge simpson|y'know i think bart might have too much homework .
marge simpson|if they keep overwhelming him , he might be turned off school forever .
marge simpson|it's okay , bart .
marge simpson|just do a couple vocabulary words , then come have some milk and cookies .
marge simpson|never mind what he said .
marge simpson|you just listen to me .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|put down those books and go play this instant !
marge simpson|there's no such thing as prayer blocks !
marge simpson|i said he could take a break .
marge simpson|don't contradict me in front of our son !
marge simpson|let's have lunch at crouching tiger hidden eggroll .
marge simpson|the last time you ate there you spent three nights in the mall jail !
marge simpson|well , you always miss when you throw your underpants at the hamper !
marge simpson|you practiced all day on my birthday !
marge simpson|you were never going to apologize !
marge simpson|you're wrong !
marge simpson|and whenever you're wrong you just sprout gibberish .
marge simpson|well then there won't be any sex !
marge simpson|i just think when two people disagree , the big jerk ought to apologize .
marge simpson|i'm going to find my husband .
marge simpson|but don't depress the kids .
marge simpson|i'm sorry we ever fought .
marge simpson|till the two of us are back on track , bart can fend for himself .
marge simpson|it's working !
marge simpson|i'm gonna go paste your heads back into the family photos .
marge simpson|i've got them right here .
marge simpson|oh my god , homie we're having a real conversation !
marge simpson|nope .
marge simpson|mom and dad , bart is going to use the old subway to destroy springfield elementary !
marge simpson|and there's a map of the subway system attached .
marge simpson|homer , we've got to stop him !
marge simpson|mister , you are grounded !
marge simpson|and i'm taking all the exciting colors out of your crayons !
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|i thought you were fixing my brakes !
marge simpson|you mean ...
marge simpson|he kissed her ?
marge simpson|thank you .
marge simpson|and it means the world to me .
marge simpson|that's not bart , it's principal skinner .
marge simpson|bart's sitting right next to you .
marge simpson|homer , i can hear your sarcasm from inside the house and the dishwasher's on !
marge simpson|what's going on here ?
marge simpson|well , we will take you up on your offer .
marge simpson|but we insist on paying our own way .
marge simpson|and homer , put on some pants .
marge simpson|homie , just tell them what they wanna hear !
marge simpson|do you have any safety tips ?
marge simpson|but it says here in the brochure ...
marge simpson|shalom to you !
marge simpson|shalom is the aloha of this place .
marge simpson|oh homie , you're alive !
marge simpson|but you still have our passports , right ?
marge simpson|oh my god , homer's gone !
marge simpson|what's he gonna do now ?
marge simpson|thanks , but you can stop giving the tour now .
marge simpson|no thanks .

marge simpson|eat it .

marge simpson|i give up !
marge simpson|i hope dylan likes trucks .
marge simpson|dealing drugs ?
marge simpson|that's impossible .
marge simpson|he ...
marge simpson|he doesn't have the math skills !
marge simpson|bart ?
marge simpson|bart , are you here ?
marge simpson|that's drug talk !
marge simpson|but i could be mistaken .
marge simpson|let me just listen to a little more , out of context .
marge simpson|bart simpson , are you a drugo ?
marge simpson|well , can you explain what you were doing in the basement with milhouse ?
marge simpson|hey , that's pretty nifty .

marge simpson|homie , maybe this is too much electricity .
marge simpson|our wedding china's ruined .
marge simpson|homie , can i talk to you for a second ?
marge simpson|homie , i happened to read about beached whales in springfield geographic .
marge simpson|it usually does not end well .
marge simpson|we can't let lisa get her hopes up .
marge simpson|lisa is very sensitive .
marge simpson|lisa , sweetheart it's almost dinnertime .
marge simpson|why don't you come home ?
marge simpson|tonight let's all draw pictures of what your father just said .
marge simpson|does he have a cute accent ?
marge simpson|oooh , he sounds just like paddington bear !
marge simpson|what is it , ned ?
marge simpson|should we inform the chief ?
marge simpson|i don't know ...
marge simpson|that's not sesame street , that's a gay bar .
marge simpson|although i guess this would teach her sharing and caring , but ...
marge simpson|we're going home .
marge simpson|homer , maggie has to wear that clown mask for halloween .
marge simpson|what's going on ?
marge simpson|i don't see what's so wonderful .

marge simpson|you said you'd be home by seven to help with my mother's birthday !
marge simpson|i'm still mad at you from last night .
marge simpson|what do you think ?
marge simpson|my mother explained that what happened at the party wasn't your fault .
marge simpson|homie , slow down !

marge simpson|credenza , credenza , lowboy , sideboard , portmanteau ...
marge simpson|and where there's exotic fish , there's gotta be a ...
marge simpson|water feature ...
marge simpson|why on earth do you think that harmlesslooking man ...
marge simpson|is sideshow bob ?
marge simpson|a lot of people sound like sideshow bob , like frasier on cheers .
marge simpson|or lieutenant commander tom dodge in down periscope .
marge simpson|honey , his name is walt warren , and he's a very nice man .
marge simpson|he stopped me from driving away with my coffee cup on top of the car .
marge simpson|bart ?
marge simpson|what are you doing ?
marge simpson|you're indoors at an outdoor party !
marge simpson|it's probably a deboner .

marge simpson|excuse me , have you seen this man ?
marge simpson|homer , can we please find bart ?

marge simpson|lisa ?
marge simpson|are you in here ?
marge simpson|is it your laundry ?
marge simpson|lisa , look !

marge simpson|it's not your fault , grampa .
marge simpson|these cards are too slippery .
marge simpson|see ?
marge simpson|dammit .
marge simpson|now remember what grampa said you can spend the money any way you want .
marge simpson|hm , i think i'll look for a new handbag ...
marge simpson|ooo , i wonder how much that one is .
marge simpson|gotta look without looking like i'm looking .
marge simpson|yes !
marge simpson|i'd like this bag , please !

marge simpson|sweetie , you could still go to mcgill the harvard of canada .
marge simpson|homie , maybe you could do it .
marge simpson|no it's not !
marge simpson|cut it out !
marge simpson|you're upsetting the gravy boat !
marge simpson|lisa , can't you let your brother back on the team ?
marge simpson|fly balls and fungoes come and go , but family is forever .
marge simpson|what about bart's feelings ?
marge simpson|why do you say such ridiculous things ?
marge simpson|mama bear said 'i'm sure sister bear will come to her senses .
marge simpson|brother bear said sister bear is inconsiderate .
marge simpson|actually , i'm taking you on a special little guy super happy fun day !
marge simpson|you're not going to the dentist !
marge simpson|lisa ?
marge simpson|she wants to talk to you .
marge simpson|mike scioscia !
marge simpson|didn't you get radiation poisoning working at the springfield nuclear plant ?
marge simpson|this is that videogame reverend lovejoy said you shouldn't play !
marge simpson|i still think it's too violent .
marge simpson|these classic board games are fun and safe .
marge simpson|oh homie , what a great idea to take a cruise in uncharted waters .
marge simpson|whew , sure is hot out here ...
marge simpson|homie , help him up !

marge simpson|homer , i am so sick of this unmotivated , jealous ...

marge simpson|we're murderers !
marge simpson|murderers !
marge simpson|why did you do that ?
marge simpson|you're alive ?
marge simpson|we'll know .
marge simpson|i can't live with the guilt .
marge simpson|just sugarplums and buttercups .
marge simpson|dinner is served .
marge simpson|i tried to make what homer said you liked .
marge simpson|get them back she can't get neckholes !
marge simpson|it's picture day tomorrow !

marge simpson|that tree used to be a smaller tree .
marge simpson|and that food bank used to be a regular bank .
marge simpson|there's my old house !
marge simpson|we're not here for rabbit .
marge simpson|i used to live in this house as a girl .
marge simpson|oh , i'd love to , if it's not an imposition .
marge simpson|everything's just the way i remember it ...
marge simpson|you see that mirror ?
marge simpson|this was my bedroom !
marge simpson|my bedpost smooshes are still in the carpet !
marge simpson|there are no books in the car .
marge simpson|my memorables !
marge simpson|my whole childhood is in this box !

marge simpson|i never really had the hair for these .
marge simpson|oh , that's ancient history .
marge simpson|ooh , here's my paper on ancient history .
marge simpson|you kids play nice up there !
marge simpson|but it's not good enough , is it ?
marge simpson|that's odd .
marge simpson|lisa just threw her saxophone out the window .
marge simpson|she doesn't want to end up like me ?
marge simpson|what's so wrong with me ?
marge simpson|i remember everything .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|just a picture of lisa .

marge simpson|stupid pan .
marge simpson|uhhuh , yeah .
marge simpson|here's your breakfast .
marge simpson|not a good time !
marge simpson|would it be so bad to turn out like me ?
marge simpson|we'd love to send you here , sweetie .

marge simpson|homer , lisa , could you please step outside ?
marge simpson|i have a few choice words for this gentleman .
marge simpson|you what ?

marge simpson|bart , who are you talking to ?
marge simpson|what's all that noise ?
marge simpson|hm ...
marge simpson|well , okay .
marge simpson|i hope they use that spit for a good cause , like sealing wedding envelopes .
marge simpson|thank god mr burns isn't alive to see this .
marge simpson|it's not up to you .
marge simpson|we're going to take him to our moral and civic leaders .
marge simpson|they'll know the right thing to do .
marge simpson|mr burns , you can't hurt us after all we've done for you .
marge simpson|you were given six weeks to live .
marge simpson|and you've outlived it !
marge simpson|homer , are you scaring those kids ?
marge simpson|opossum !
marge simpson|sweetie , everyone has an animal they can't stand .
marge simpson|indiana jones had snakes , the grizzly man had grizzlies , and ...
marge simpson|you know , i'm not crazy about opossums .
marge simpson|those creepy little claws ...
marge simpson|who's a possum ?
marge simpson|you're a possum .

marge simpson|i bought it because catherine zeta jones told me to .
marge simpson|what a fool i was .
marge simpson|are you sure ?
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|well , ditching is a harsh word .
marge simpson|it wasn't really a lot of chitchat .
marge simpson|bart , sweetie ...

marge simpson|so , lisa .
marge simpson|do you want an ostrich feather centerpiece ?
marge simpson|well we've gotta buy something !
marge simpson|more oxycontin candy , sweetie ?
marge simpson|wrong holiday , stupid !
marge simpson|i could use some help !
marge simpson|lisa , what are you doing ?
marge simpson|next you'll have a problem with my gingerbread house .
marge simpson|at least someone around here's got the christmas spirit .
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|but you wanted those toys .
marge simpson|even mac davis himself couldn't save this christmas .
marge simpson|i'm trying !
marge simpson|it just keeps popping off .
marge simpson|you can make it through this , marge .
marge simpson|just think of homer .
marge simpson|this tree reminds me of your father .
marge simpson|right before christmas ?
marge simpson|but i ...
marge simpson|auf wiedersehen .
marge simpson|i've always believed in you even when others didn't .
marge simpson|can you help save our family christmas ?
marge simpson|marge simpson .
marge simpson|martha stewart !
marge simpson|how did you get in here ?
marge simpson|but i was gonna oooh !
marge simpson|so , this stuff will just shampoo out , huh ?
marge simpson|he's starting to wake up .
marge simpson|martha , the house looks beautiful it's like christmas with a childless gay couple .
marge simpson|but it's just not the same without my family being themselves .
marge simpson|you have a magic wand ?
marge simpson|i guess i'll never have a perfect christmas .
marge simpson|what's wrong , homie ?
marge simpson|everyone shush !
marge simpson|i didn't .
marge simpson|i got secondhand wasted from smooching your father .
marge simpson|so not a peep out of anyone till the fiesta bowl !
marge simpson|i know when the freakin' fiesta bowl is !
marge simpson|dear lord , watch over my sweet homie while he's in the hoosegow .
marge simpson|what's going on ?
marge simpson|i called the prison and they won't tell me where homer is !
marge simpson|homie , i know you had a terrible experience , but it's over .
marge simpson|you never took me to that bar on the beach .
marge simpson|sounds pretty good .
marge simpson|why do you have to eat peanuts in the shower ?
marge simpson|i was afraid this day would come .
marge simpson|when it's closed it's a chair !
marge simpson|when you were little , i used to take you to a mommyandme toddler gym .
marge simpson|you were friends with three other boys and i became close with their moms .
marge simpson|but they were a bad influence on you .
marge simpson|the moms and i had a falling out , which was a shame .
marge simpson|we had been such good friends .
marge simpson|we called ourselves the cool moms .
marge simpson|maybe we could get back together ...
marge simpson|you can't buy white wine !
marge simpson|it's all yours .
marge simpson|seven years .
marge simpson|a lot of memories .
marge simpson|talking , chatting ...
marge simpson|i'm glad you had fun , because we're all getting together next week .

marge simpson|they went to the beach every day !
marge simpson|but i don't want a beach house .
marge simpson|sand makes me sad .
marge simpson|because it used to be big rocks .
marge simpson|but not anymore .
marge simpson|not anymore ...
marge simpson|what are you boys doing ?
marge simpson|milhouse , i'm getting tired of waiting .
marge simpson|yes , you may .
marge simpson|bart , sweetie ...
marge simpson|it's close , but no .
marge simpson|so bart ...
marge simpson|the little dickens ...
marge simpson|was gonna set off an explosion to break us up .
marge simpson|can you believe it ?
marge simpson|what are you talking about ?
marge simpson|you know nothing about my son and even less about apples .
marge simpson|good day , ladies .
marge simpson|i think they were never my friends ...
marge simpson|maybe true friends aren't random people you meet at a mommy and me class .
marge simpson|they're random people you meet in a college dorm .
marge simpson|awww ...
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|homer got along so well with the other dads , i couldn't break it to him .
marge simpson|what do you mean , wig ?
marge simpson|moe , do these guys think you're one of them ?
marge simpson|now it's ready for garbage !
marge simpson|what's wrong , homie ?
marge simpson|there's nothing sexier than a man being a good dad .
marge simpson|whoa !
marge simpson|just hope the kids didn't hear us .
marge simpson|homer , you can't order anything from that magazine .
marge simpson|it's twentyfive years old .
marge simpson|um ...
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|of course you did !
marge simpson|hey , they're your gutters too .
marge simpson|i've got summer squash !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|we only have five minutes until the school bus comes .
marge simpson|my first gray hair !
marge simpson|homie , you always mean to say the nicest things .
marge simpson|very romantic .
marge simpson|homer had the basketball game muted the whole time .
marge simpson|oh , and then i found a gray hair .
marge simpson|no big deal .
marge simpson|really ?
marge simpson|she doesn't seem so worried about her gray hair .
marge simpson|i brought home fried chicken ...
marge simpson|and a completely new hairstyle !
marge simpson|a completely new hairstyle !
marge simpson|so , what do you think ?

marge simpson|we're throwing the brunch !
marge simpson|i still can't believe it .
marge simpson|i have never been so snubbed at one of selma's weddings .
marge simpson|i don't think this is a good idea at all .
marge simpson|the only husband of selma's i liked was disco stu .
marge simpson|he was so upbeat till he found out she didn't care for disco .
marge simpson|i will !
marge simpson|can you read by it ?
marge simpson|these people are always grinding against each other , and i think they're all related .

marge simpson|but i never knew you were so good with hair .
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|homie , are you even listening to me ?
marge simpson|turns out it was a substitute .
marge simpson|this ends now !

marge simpson|homie , you're making my toes curl .
marge simpson|you sure know how to please a woman .
marge simpson|what's wrong ?

marge simpson|babies aren't supposed to sleep on their stomach on a cake !
marge simpson|okay .
marge simpson|okay , the spare key is somewhere in here .
marge simpson|we got out of it just in time .
marge simpson|at some point we should try to return these keys to their rightful owners .
marge simpson|homer , stop him !
marge simpson|excuse me , has anyone seen my toy ?
marge simpson|and these are from sardine cans your father opened .
marge simpson|he saved them out of sentimental value .
marge simpson|well , maggie , one key left for us !
marge simpson|this looks like it's from a windup toy .
marge simpson|i hope we haven't stumbled onto my anniversary present .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|could you please turn down those blimp engines and tell me where you are ?
marge simpson|i'll call you back !

marge simpson|actually , sometimes you do push ned around .
marge simpson|don't do that , homie .
marge simpson|it rubs off your side hair .
marge simpson|i hope you're proud of yourself , homer .
marge simpson|well , there's ned out on his power walk .
marge simpson|maybe you should talk to him .
marge simpson|that was a traffic signal .
marge simpson|so we're going to let the internet decide .
marge simpson|should ned and edna stay together ?
marge simpson|visit thesimpsons .
marge simpson|com and vote .
marge simpson|we'll announce the results in next year's season premiere .

marge simpson|look !
marge simpson|a shooting star !
marge simpson|on a night like tonight i have to believe there are .
marge simpson|wanna make out over the foul line ?
marge simpson|don't even bother shooting us .
marge simpson|we've found a new place that we love .
marge simpson|a place that may not have indoor plumbing , but it's got something we treasure more ...
marge simpson|what are you doing here ?
marge simpson|stop !
marge simpson|stop !
marge simpson|this is everything we put behind us !
marge simpson|ooh !
marge simpson|an apron with a sonnet !
marge simpson|a bunny !
marge simpson|just like the one i had when i was a girl !
marge simpson|how did you know ?
marge simpson|oh bart , you got me the fluffy pet i've never stopped thinking about !
marge simpson|now , last but not least , your present , homie .
marge simpson|well , we're still focused on me instead of watching golf , so that's pretty good .
marge simpson|please don't say one again .
marge simpson|homie , whatever it is , it's not happening .
marge simpson|well , at least you remembered i like her .
marge simpson|i think that's enough birthday fun .
marge simpson|homie , have you seen our stencil budget for this month ?
marge simpson|he won't leave the car .
marge simpson|i can see how this show might not be to his liking .
marge simpson|wait , wait , wait .
marge simpson|he's just a boy !
marge simpson|do you have to put him in jail ?
marge simpson|why ?
marge simpson|are you going to do the laundry ?
marge simpson|what's going on ?
marge simpson|we're wetting the bed ?
marge simpson|i'm sorry , homie .
marge simpson|a diaper just isn't sexy .
marge simpson|he's a baby with wings !
marge simpson|that's just not doing it for me .
marge simpson|professor frink , are you all right ?
marge simpson|it's kind of embarrassing ...
marge simpson|how do you know about it ?
marge simpson|so we can go inside homer's sleeping mind and find out why he's wetting the bed .
marge simpson|why does maggie have to go ?
marge simpson|it's death !
marge simpson|i recognize him from fortiethbirthday cards !
marge simpson|homie , this might be a clue !
marge simpson|what's in that coffin could be behind your nighttime oopsies !
marge simpson|what do you see ?
marge simpson|relax , everyone knows that if you die in a dream , you just wake up !
marge simpson|at last we'll get to the bottom of ...
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|we're here to find answers to your problem !
marge simpson|we know there's a marriage in trouble and it has something to do with fish ...
marge simpson|mona , you're alive ?
marge simpson|that's jennifer aniston's hair on friends .
marge simpson|case closed !
marge simpson|now , let's return our dream skis .
marge simpson|uhoh .
marge simpson|and maybe you'll stop overeating too !
marge simpson|spin the top .
marge simpson|if it falls over , we're in reality .
marge simpson|if it spins forever , we're still in a dream .
marge simpson|sounds like a plan !
marge simpson|is that hail coming down ?
marge simpson|your father must be sleeping on his side again .
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|you're home early !
marge simpson|well , we're having brunch with my sisters ...
marge simpson|and you and i were going to study the municipal voter's guide .
marge simpson|homie , what are you drinking ?
marge simpson|there's champagne in those !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|irish and long island !
marge simpson|mike's hard !
marge simpson|rum cake !
marge simpson|suzette !
marge simpson|it's no fun to live in a town with a ninetynine percent unemployment rate .
marge simpson|mr burns seemed like such a nice man the day he arrived .
marge simpson|which he didn't .
marge simpson|barney ?
marge simpson|do a lot of people pay ?
marge simpson|bart , you haven't touched your mashed potatoes .
marge simpson|bart , no dinner means no dessert .
marge simpson|he exercises so much , but he looks the same .
marge simpson|i guess the weight will all come off at once some day in the future .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|it means use the treadmill for running or take it back !
marge simpson|on the tv !
marge simpson|on the ground !
marge simpson|this is the stupidest fight ever !
marge simpson|i don't think so .
marge simpson|it means i'm mad !
marge simpson|why , if it isn't jimbo , dorf and ernie .
marge simpson|bart's not home yet , but i'm always looking to encourage nonmilhouse playdates .
marge simpson|stick around !
marge simpson|now you be careful with bart's undies .
marge simpson|homer , for god sakes , i'm trying to put maggie to sleep !
marge simpson|you wanna know what happens on your stupid show ?
marge simpson|firstly , the mysterious island is fifteen miles from long beach .
marge simpson|lisa , are you out there in your slippers ?
marge simpson|come inside !
marge simpson|homie , come in the bedroom .
marge simpson|care to join me in a private last episode party ?
marge simpson|i'm sorry , sweetie .
marge simpson|well of course they don't .
marge simpson|there is no mrs steak .
marge simpson|who could stay married to such a man .
marge simpson|just try to enjoy your dinner , sweetie .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|we saw how much this cruise means to you , so we all sold something special .
marge simpson|and we made just enough for an economy cabin !
marge simpson|and i sold our good china .
marge simpson|yeah ...
marge simpson|actually , my mom stole it from a woman she cleaned for .
marge simpson|it took her years to get the whole set .
marge simpson|we sold it to pay for a family cruise !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|this is bad for you , too !
marge simpson|no , honey .
marge simpson|you just passed out when you saw the private bedroom in our triple upgrade !
marge simpson|you'll never guess how many bath towels they gave us ...
marge simpson|enough !
marge simpson|homie ...
marge simpson|we actually have the cabin all to ourselves .
marge simpson|woowoowoowoo !
marge simpson|any place is fun if you're there with super lips .
marge simpson|purple !
marge simpson|bart , we're too worried to enjoy each other's mouths .
marge simpson|last week that steward brought me extra shampoo ...
marge simpson|he called me lovely lady .
marge simpson|bart , glad you're here .
marge simpson|we're all gonna watch a movie together .
marge simpson|there is no virus !
marge simpson|bart faked the whole thing with a dvd !
marge simpson|a directtovideo dvd !
marge simpson|excuse me , cruise director priddis .
marge simpson|my son has something to tell you .
marge simpson|i know my son did a terrible thing .
marge simpson|sorry sweetie , i just needed to get that out of my system .
marge simpson|whoa .
marge simpson|stop saying what you call things !
marge simpson|i'm trying to watch the movie !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|people are here to see the movie , not listen to you !
marge simpson|there was enough talking during the movie !
marge simpson|this date night was even worse than the date night we saw date night .
marge simpson|just take me home .
marge simpson|not in the mood .
marge simpson|got what , homer ?
marge simpson|homer , i'm a single mother trying to raise a family here .
marge simpson|just zip it !
marge simpson|i have to take maggie for her checkup .
marge simpson|and a guy's coming to see what the smell is under the house .
marge simpson|homie's been working so hard i thought i'd bring him a special lunch .
marge simpson|here , right ?
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|i knew there was a reason he was leaving on time !
marge simpson|busy day at work ?
marge simpson|did you get a lot of work done , workerman ?
marge simpson|head injury ?
marge simpson|why didn't you tell me ?
marge simpson|this car's so clean !
marge simpson|i'm not getting flea bites on my ankles !
marge simpson|why is he trying to kill you and why did she call you her love ?
marge simpson|the guy from the movie ?
marge simpson|so , how many more weeks do you have off ?
marge simpson|also , the passion play isn't stupid , it's the greatest story ever told !
marge simpson|ned and edna married ?
marge simpson|congratulations , you two !
marge simpson|we're so , so happy for you !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|enough with the voting .
marge simpson|ned , edna , why didn't you tell us ?
marge simpson|ned , edna ...
marge simpson|we just want to apologize for the commotion in your room ...
marge simpson|well , we're here to offer to throw you a little party in your honor .
marge simpson|this is my third favorite wedding supply store !
marge simpson|it's extreme enough for me when they smear the wedding cake on each other's faces .
marge simpson|thank you !
marge simpson|everyone's having a great time .
marge simpson|helen , have a canapé !
marge simpson|there's enough for everyone , but not too much .
marge simpson|no weird hookups !
marge simpson|so , how do the boys like springfield elementary ?
marge simpson|time for cake !
marge simpson|let's finish this sucker up .
marge simpson|why does that make him right ?
marge simpson|no video ...
marge simpson|party over ...
marge simpson|caaaake !
marge simpson|ned , how did you sleep ?
marge simpson|here's your lunches .
marge simpson|with some cake .
marge simpson|you'll be having cake for a long , long , time .
marge simpson|bart , is there something you want to tell us ?
marge simpson|that is totally irresponsible parenting !
marge simpson|where on the internet ?
marge simpson|why would you believe him ?
marge simpson|it's angry .
marge simpson|it's about not agreeing on something .
marge simpson|bart , just tell us the problem !
marge simpson|and that's how berber carpet got its name , according to some .
marge simpson|lisa , how was your day ?
marge simpson|whoever this truth teller is , i'm a fan .
marge simpson|it takes a lot of courage to post nice things anonymously .
marge simpson|now sweetie , don't make a big deal out of this .
marge simpson|i stopped reading after top student .
marge simpson|i'm afraid handholding isn't going to cheer me up .
marge simpson|i never have any idea what to do for lisa .
marge simpson|it's so hard .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|lisa snuck out .
marge simpson|what are you gonna say ?
marge simpson|homer , we can buy scotch tape tomorrow !
marge simpson|all right , who took the microwave ?
marge simpson|bart , that's sweet , but we'd need airplane money , hotel money ...
marge simpson|homer , that sounds like the sweet smell of success .
marge simpson|so , this is basically what we can afford .
marge simpson|oh , forget it .
marge simpson|just once i'd like your father to be on a jumbotron for something good .
marge simpson|no , lisa !
marge simpson|if you click that turnstile , it'll blow our budget !
marge simpson|ladiesandgentlemenihaveanannouncement .
marge simpson|that's not iambic pentameter !
marge simpson|well at least it didn't end as bad as romeo and juliet .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|for details , log onto thesimpsons .
marge simpson|com .
marge simpson|okay , that's it !
marge simpson|i'm putting a babygate across the black hole , and don't throw anything more into it !
marge simpson|uhoh , yes , homer .
marge simpson|i know we shouldn't feed this , but grease brings raccoons .
marge simpson|quit bageling my english muffins !
marge simpson|now what ?
marge simpson|wonderful stuff !
marge simpson|enjoy it !
marge simpson|not with the camera on .
marge simpson|looks like the red light's on .
marge simpson|i don't know , i don't know !
marge simpson|i'm sure i don't know !
marge simpson|come here , you .
marge simpson|give back my baby !
marge simpson|i brought this on us all .
marge simpson|it began when i was a girl ...
marge simpson|it was not love at first sight !
marge simpson|here's your smoothie , sweetheart .
marge simpson|i'll tell you what i'm doing , i'm realizing that i married the wrong man .
marge simpson|oh , you poor , sweet , simple homers .
marge simpson|i was supposed to be with all of you .
marge simpson|even you , caveman homer .
marge simpson|well , cardinal or cannibal , i wish that twenty years ago i had chosen love .
marge simpson|lemme get this straight .
marge simpson|none of you had time to take out the garbage ?
marge simpson|hummingbirds !
marge simpson|hum and get it !
marge simpson|homie , the faucet is dripping .
marge simpson|homer , when are you going to fix this faucet ?
marge simpson|are you going to fix the faucet or not ?
marge simpson|i'll get to it , marge ...
marge simpson|i'll get to it ...
marge simpson|when we first got married , he'd only take six months to do things ...
marge simpson|everyone relax .
marge simpson|i think i've got an emergency sinkhole kit in here somewhere .
marge simpson|no one stays in the sinkhole !
marge simpson|but my car is down there !
marge simpson|no , i'm here to buy one myself .
marge simpson|this car looks a little small .
marge simpson|is the engine powerful ?
marge simpson|this says you are the manager .
marge simpson|it says on your facebook page you have no kids .
marge simpson|uhoh !
marge simpson|do you hear that rattle ?
marge simpson|and what's that smell ?
marge simpson|well i don't like it .
marge simpson|i still smell it !
marge simpson|darn car won't start .
marge simpson|hmm .
marge simpson|well , it wouldn't start for me .
marge simpson|i think this car's a lemon !
marge simpson|excuse me .
marge simpson|what are you talking about ?
marge simpson|all right , i remember we all got in ...
marge simpson|and by the way , that backseat is pretty tight for the kids .
marge simpson|i mean , i don't know what we'd do if we had another baby .
marge simpson|with this car , we're basically saying no more babies !
marge simpson|homer , the reason i hate this car is ...
marge simpson|i think i want another baby !
marge simpson|i do !
marge simpson|homie , i want another baby .
marge simpson|maggie's not a baby !
marge simpson|her soft spot's been skulled over for the last three months !
marge simpson|being a mom is who i am , and i'm not done being who i am .
marge simpson|well , take a shower , 'cause we're gonna try it tonight !
marge simpson|homer , why do you take a three second pause before you answer what i say ?
marge simpson|what a wonderful thought .
marge simpson|my husband and i have been snuggling six ways from sunday ...
marge simpson|but we aren't making a baby .
marge simpson|i thought we should check , to make sure homer has ...
marge simpson|you know , working stuntmen in his cannon .
marge simpson|what do you mean ?
marge simpson|i guess ...
marge simpson|that's that , then .
marge simpson|i can't believe we're never going to have another child ...
marge simpson|no , s'okay .
marge simpson|we can share this with you ...
marge simpson|homer can't make a baby because he nuked his swimmers .
marge simpson|you never told me about that .
marge simpson|awww ...
marge simpson|eww ...
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|we still have a chance !
marge simpson|now i'm thinking alex if it's a girl and xander if it's a boy .
marge simpson|okay .
marge simpson|ooh , a christmas ornament museum !
marge simpson|can we stop ?
marge simpson|i think that shiva used to be paul bunyan .
marge simpson|i can't believe we spent the whole day here .
marge simpson|well , maybe we should check into a motel .
marge simpson|ooh , homie , you've lost weight .
marge simpson|it sure was nice to have a day together as a couple .
marge simpson|i thought the whole point of this trip was to have another baby .
marge simpson|so , you don't want another baby ?
marge simpson|how long have you felt this way ?
marge simpson|just yell across the house like you do everything else !
marge simpson|we're not talking !
marge simpson|you were pocketdialed !
marge simpson|shush !
marge simpson|homer ...
marge simpson|homer , this is the point where i really have to know what you want .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|how many samples did you sell ?
marge simpson|i thought they only paid fifty dollars a trip .
marge simpson|homie , maybe we should wait .
marge simpson|maybe there's enough homer in the world for now .
marge simpson|you know , i always send the theater manager a check the next day .
marge simpson|another way is don't drink .
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|do you know what yesterday was ?
marge simpson|yesterday's the day we were supposed to visit grampa !
marge simpson|i still feel guilty .
marge simpson|your father's not going to be around forever .
marge simpson|fine , he'll be around forever .
marge simpson|there's gotta be a clue in here somewhere .
marge simpson|spats , sock garters , the world's hardest hard candy ...
marge simpson|grampa's army footlocker !
marge simpson|i bet the most important things in the world to him are in this box !
marge simpson|spiro's ...
marge simpson|the place that changed my life ?
marge simpson|got it .
marge simpson|papadapaconstantikasgianopolopodopotopolis .
marge simpson|there's exactly one rita lafleur living in springfield !
marge simpson|hello ?
marge simpson|rita lafleur ?
marge simpson|did you know a man named abe simpson ?
marge simpson|homer , she's married to your dad !
marge simpson|you never looked up to him .
marge simpson|well , we certainly don't want to cause you any more pain .
marge simpson|that kind of romance leads to children .
marge simpson|so , this was after homer's mother left ?
marge simpson|but i thought you still loved him .
marge simpson|what does that mean ?
marge simpson|abe , we were so worried .
marge simpson|grampa , we will never miss a visit again .
marge simpson|and there'll be a lot more of them .
marge simpson|don't take grampa's meds !
marge simpson|sh !
marge simpson|here comes lisa's solo !
marge simpson|lisa !
marge simpson|please say it's the vegetarianism !
marge simpson|lisa , dinnertime !
marge simpson|lisa ...
marge simpson|would you like some shrimp ?
marge simpson|homer , pay attention !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|the roof is leaking !
marge simpson|water's coming in the house , and we've got carpet mushrooms !
marge simpson|while you were out there daydreaming , this rain has ruined the house .
marge simpson|you're coming with us to the school fundraiser .
marge simpson|the only thing we know is it'll cost eight hundred dollars .
marge simpson|i don't care for silent auctions .
marge simpson|it just encourages hovering .
marge simpson|that adult etchasketch certainly has brightened your mood .
marge simpson|i always thought the pringles man had the kindest eyes .
marge simpson|are you doing an app behind my back ?
marge simpson|put that down !
marge simpson|we're being audited !
marge simpson|homie , you want to read to maggie before she goes to sleep ?
marge simpson|homie ...
marge simpson|it looks like you're putting all your eggs in one basket .
marge simpson|hm , i guess you're right .
marge simpson|i guess i'll have to scratch that off the list of things i say .
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|i like that its message is in sap and not in blood ...
marge simpson|like some miracles i could mention .
marge simpson|passover .
marge simpson|homie ?
marge simpson|aren't you going to come in ?
marge simpson|don't call satan !
marge simpson|so what if the message wasn't a miracle ?
marge simpson|homie , you have such a way with foods .
marge simpson|let's go inside .
marge simpson|no idea .
marge simpson|the important thing is that they did .
marge simpson|relax , kids , just be yourselves .
marge simpson|scientists prove cat heaven real , human heaven not that's so sad ...
marge simpson|oh ...
marge simpson|satire .
marge simpson|and these fake movie reviews are so mean , it's hilarious .
marge simpson|great paper .
marge simpson|maggie's a little hungry .
marge simpson|that's not applesauce ...
marge simpson|it sure is !
marge simpson|there's nothing more natural than ...
marge simpson|that .
marge simpson|it's just that maggie's already ...
marge simpson|milked me today !
marge simpson|homer , i think we should go .
marge simpson|we're not like these people .
marge simpson|you're all bald !
marge simpson|maybe we shouldn't rush things with the new neighbors .
marge simpson|you know , we might not all be a perfect match .
marge simpson|but i always thought you were cool .
marge simpson|well sweetie , if it's that important to you , i guess we can try .
marge simpson|ooo !
marge simpson|hygiene !
marge simpson|your father took you to a korean gangster film festival ?
marge simpson|the kids are a mess !
marge simpson|you brought them home exhausted and pretentious !
marge simpson|parenting shouldn't have a style !
marge simpson|parenting is about bedtimes and passwords on computers and complicated punishments you never follow through on !
marge simpson|are you wearing a wallet chain ?
marge simpson|you look like ...
marge simpson|a barista !
marge simpson|and what's with the scarf ?
marge simpson|it's soaked in neck sweat .
marge simpson|made ?
marge simpson|why didn't you just buy him a toy ?
marge simpson|there's gotta be a bounce house around here somewhere .
marge simpson|at least maybe a piñata ...
marge simpson|holy areole ...
marge simpson|i'd love to , but maggie's a little shy ...
marge simpson|play along !
marge simpson|ooh , this couldn't feel more natural .
marge simpson|glug , glug , glug .
marge simpson|that's a good little mammal .
marge simpson|fine !
marge simpson|i admit it , you ...
marge simpson|nipple nazis !
marge simpson|i give my baby formula !
marge simpson|stay back !
marge simpson|you know i'll use this ...
marge simpson|because you saw me using it .
marge simpson|also , i didn't want to tell you , but ...
marge simpson|that wife and her gang looked down on me because i don't breastfeed !
marge simpson|when you're old , your tattoos will be saggy and illegible !
marge simpson|see , see what i'm dealing with here , ned ?
marge simpson|we invited them here , and they repay us with insults and judgments .
marge simpson|the cool people are everywhere !
marge simpson|somehow they've even made the weather rainier !
marge simpson|c'mere , little buddy .
marge simpson|stop your trendy arguing !
marge simpson|i'm trying to call the fire department !
marge simpson|then to save us ...
marge simpson|we need something incredibly unnatural !
marge simpson|fifty gallons of baby formula will put out that blaze .
marge simpson|i guess i do feel a little bad about not breastfeeding my kids ...
marge simpson|except lisa .
marge simpson|i breastfed lisa for nine months .
marge simpson|milhouse ?
marge simpson|hurry up !
marge simpson|you know you can't lift your lifting belt without wearing your beltliftingbelt !
marge simpson|fine .
marge simpson|just stay here and hold down the fort .
marge simpson|maybe one of your tavern wenches can do the laundry .
marge simpson|did you spend this whole time doing fake chores in a fake village ?
marge simpson|the animal shelter hasn't had any greyhounds turned in .
marge simpson|just a dachshund , a chow , and a pregnant raccoon .
marge simpson|we don't want a raccoon .
marge simpson|and he didn't pee on the floor !
marge simpson|focus !
marge simpson|well , tell us your version .
marge simpson|oh homie .
marge simpson|i'm so sorry .
marge simpson|just hug already !
marge simpson|homie ?
marge simpson|homer , i told you , don't call me mom .
marge simpson|this isn't the learn zone .
marge simpson|darn it , it's a fun place !
marge simpson|where do they go ?
marge simpson|keep an eye on the kids , homer .
marge simpson|bart and lisa .
marge simpson|calm down , everyone .
marge simpson|calm down .
marge simpson|i'm sure they'll have us out of here soon .
marge simpson|until then , why don't we bond by sharing our child birth experiences .
marge simpson|see ?
marge simpson|all you need to get through a crisis is a little friendly conversation .
marge simpson|betcha the dads are doing the same thing !
marge simpson|you've been through a traumatic experience .
marge simpson|are you sure you wanna go to work today ?
marge simpson|i can't find all our cereal , crackers , juice boxes , the butter brush ...
marge simpson|what move ?
marge simpson|we haven't moved !
marge simpson|what's going on ?
marge simpson|you can't have secrets from your wife !
marge simpson|i thought the basement looked cleaner .
marge simpson|survive what ?
marge simpson|it's reassuring to see you're aware of the future .
marge simpson|but this is all a little ...
marge simpson|creepy .
marge simpson|i'm going to bed .
marge simpson|the end of the world as we know it ?
marge simpson|lisa and maggie are downstairs , and bart's in his room with milhouse .
marge simpson|no one was laughing .
marge simpson|you kept it a secret !
marge simpson|how can you call yourself a christian ?
marge simpson|homer simpson !
marge simpson|but some day those good looks are gonna fade .
marge simpson|i'm proud of you .
marge simpson|society may have crumbled , but our decency hasn't .
marge simpson|good boy .
marge simpson|you're a good man , homer simpson .
marge simpson|everything's normal .
marge simpson|the world didn't end .
marge simpson|i'm afraid not .
marge simpson|and this goes too .
marge simpson|excuse me , you're that proctor that's shutting down my children's school .
marge simpson|you've been in public education a long time , haven't you ?
marge simpson|burly paper towels , burlyville , minnesota .
marge simpson|dear sir or madam your paper towel packets promised a hundred and two sheets of towels .
marge simpson|but i was blessed to receive one hundred and three .
marge simpson|i'm returning the extra towel , unused ...
marge simpson|a pillowcase full of quarters ?
marge simpson|where did you get that money and what have you done with the pillows ?
marge simpson|well , we're gonna turn this change into change for the better !
marge simpson|and i hope bart passes his test and saves the school .
marge simpson|i'm not sure if you gave my son any ...
marge simpson|extra help .
marge simpson|but if you did , thank you .
marge simpson|would you ...
marge simpson|like to have coffee , or dinner , or just talk ?
marge simpson|we have to do something until the storm passes .
marge simpson|now just fill out these customs forms and we can get started .
marge simpson|no , homie !
marge simpson|it's too dangerous !
marge simpson|what , 'cause they rented a van and taped an antenna to the top ?
marge simpson|all right , but i'm coming with you to make sure no one does anything stupid .
marge simpson|i guess you do know your weather .
marge simpson|aw .
marge simpson|homer , you do not have to compete with your friends for me .
marge simpson|enough with the singing !
marge simpson|it's like god's vacuum cleaner !
marge simpson|and here comes santa's little helper !
marge simpson|homie , we made it !
marge simpson|are you pushing ?
marge simpson|i don't know if we're gonna be able to get out .
marge simpson|what are you writing ?
marge simpson|hey !
marge simpson|hello !
marge simpson|just cut the glass !
marge simpson|homie , if we did both die , we've never named guardians .
marge simpson|the kids could end up wards of the state .
marge simpson|no , our state .
marge simpson|there's really only one choice .
marge simpson|or should i say two identical choices ?
marge simpson|homer , my sisters adopted ling and she's doing great .
marge simpson|maybe we'd better go .
marge simpson|i think it's time to go off family .
marge simpson|uh oh .
marge simpson|i wonder if word has gotten out that we're looking for guardians .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|dual incomes , no kids at two o'clock !
marge simpson|i think i hear a slight accent .
marge simpson|that's where they filmed the wire !
marge simpson|step on it !
marge simpson|that's moe and a bag of garbage .
marge simpson|so , surfing is really your job ?
marge simpson|just for standing on a thing ?
marge simpson|homie ...
marge simpson|it's been a wonderful day ...
marge simpson|but do you think maybe we're moving a little too quickly ?
marge simpson|but we know so little about them .
marge simpson|well , i must admit it's a relief to get that taken care of .
marge simpson|a whole weekend ?
marge simpson|i don't know ...
marge simpson|i guess .
marge simpson|as long as we don't make it a habit .
marge simpson|do you have to do that in front of people ?
marge simpson|well , at least we have time to get the pets' christmas presents .
marge simpson|oh god !
marge simpson|they want to steal our kids !
marge simpson|it all makes sense now .
marge simpson|that's why they took our kids so quick .
marge simpson|she's gonna raise three kids without wrecking that perfect figure .

marge simpson|look at me !
marge simpson|maybe instead of watching tv with the kids , you could take them outside and ...
marge simpson|what are you doing ?
marge simpson|this socalled educational dvd may have even stunted the development of the kids who watched it !
marge simpson|i'm afraid so .
marge simpson|while bart turned out so wonderful in his own way !
marge simpson|i wish i knew what happened ...
marge simpson|and now that i know better , no dvds for you kids .
marge simpson|just educational television .
marge simpson|okay , no tv at all .
marge simpson|fine , no tv for twentyfour hours .

marge simpson|they've disappeared !
marge simpson|do you think lisa went to that jazz club i wouldn't take her to ?
marge simpson|homie , do you see anything ?

marge simpson|we spent a thousand dollars on a bunch of old boxes ?
marge simpson|i wasn't laughing i was being worried .

marge simpson|it's not all lady stuff .
marge simpson|look at all these fitness publications .
marge simpson|i think your dad might be gay .
marge simpson|i think this is great !
marge simpson|old gay men are adorable !
marge simpson|like wrinkle dogs in a wrinkle dog calendar .
marge simpson|they even had a gay float in the pride parade last year .
marge simpson|oh homie , you're so ...
marge simpson|enlightened .
marge simpson|oh honey , that's just silly !
marge simpson|this'll show helen lovejoy , always bragging about her heshe cousin !
marge simpson|abe ...

marge simpson|wonderful older man seeks life partner before rapidlyencroaching death .
marge simpson|how about some fatties ?

marge simpson|don't you want to be happy , abe ?
marge simpson|admit who you are , a wonderful gay man !
marge simpson|is this true ?
marge simpson|i so wanted him to be gay .
marge simpson|thank you .
marge simpson|homer , do something !
marge simpson|they're killing each other !
marge simpson|your grandfather is not psycho !
marge simpson|the only thing he's straightup is loves you .
marge simpson|it's so sad that grampa has to cheat instead of relying on his godgiven wrestling skills .
marge simpson|what kind of person revels in disapproval ?
marge simpson|your behavior at that game was unacceptable !
marge simpson|you're lucky they gave you your participant trophy .
marge simpson|i know your grampa seems exciting now ...
marge simpson|but all that preening and cheating , those turnbuckle antics are not gonna make him happy .
marge simpson|as long as he's a nice person .
marge simpson|oh , that was so sweet .
marge simpson|it's not chinchilla .
marge simpson|i just thought she needed more sleep .
marge simpson|ned flanders , i can't believe you struck my husband .
marge simpson|ned , homie's a little cranky right now .
marge simpson|more than his eye , i think you hurt his feelings .
marge simpson|my what ?
marge simpson|i never made that noise in my life !
marge simpson|i wish you wouldn't wear sweaters that the senior ladies knit .
marge simpson|what's the matter , sweetie ?
marge simpson|is a book character having difficulties ?
marge simpson|did you tell the teacher ?
marge simpson|a teacher can't be a bully .
marge simpson|we're here because our daughter is being bullied by your teacher .
marge simpson|well , she's just a substitute .
marge simpson|maybe you could transfer ms .
marge simpson|cantwell to another school .
marge simpson|homer , that's you .
marge simpson|power .
marge simpson|power .
marge simpson|they sure are getting along .
marge simpson|objection !
marge simpson|unhealthy !
marge simpson|i volunteered to wash the egg stains off everyone's clothes .
marge simpson|it's one of those things you say and hope nobody takes you up on it .
marge simpson|what's odd ?
marge simpson|splatter ?
marge simpson|interesting .
marge simpson|except you missed one thing .
marge simpson|it's not a skirt .
marge simpson|it's a kilt !
marge simpson|why'd you do it , willie ?
marge simpson|this is the coolest sushi restaurant in town !
marge simpson|it got threeandahalf stars in the springfield tire guide !
marge simpson|if they can be that rude , the food must be great !
marge simpson|it's as yummy as your poorlyproduced local commercial said .
marge simpson|so without the kids we can have sophisticated grownup talk .
marge simpson|uh , i'm thinking of getting maggie swimming lessons .
marge simpson|i think i'm interesting !
marge simpson|can you chew with your mouth closed ?
marge simpson|it's like looking into a garbage disposal .
marge simpson|the most romantic part of this was the hold music when i made the reservation .
marge simpson|that usually works , but not today .
marge simpson|lousy .
marge simpson|i'm going to take a cab .
marge simpson|i'm not going to sleep !
marge simpson|inground ?

marge simpson|homer ...
marge simpson|this list is from six years ago .
marge simpson|he's taken a step .
marge simpson|he's really close .
marge simpson|all he has to do is not eat a piece before i do .
marge simpson|okay .
marge simpson|but every man deserves a second chance .
marge simpson|as long as he doesn't ...
marge simpson|i'm not hungry .
marge simpson|goodnight .
marge simpson|mmm ...
marge simpson|new cushion smell !
marge simpson|it's a snuggle dungeon !
marge simpson|what does this do ?
marge simpson|this is not putting me in the mood !
marge simpson|why would you think i'd like this ?
marge simpson|really ?
marge simpson|jeez , they make everything .
marge simpson|i'm glad you're okay .
marge simpson|ohhh .
marge simpson|and there's nothing a woman loves more than that .
marge simpson|actually i'm cool with one of them .
marge simpson|not gonna say .
marge simpson|d .

marge simpson|it came from corporate !
marge simpson|how did we get bedbugs ?
marge simpson|everyone , please !

marge simpson|vodka ?
marge simpson|is this krusty's ?
marge simpson|a highvoltage monkey prod ?
marge simpson|it is krusty's !
marge simpson|he must have my dress .
marge simpson|let's go !
marge simpson|i don't want a comedian knowing my dress size !
marge simpson|what about my dress ?
marge simpson|what do you think ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|you're not supposed to see the dress before the wedding !
marge simpson|oh sweetie , it's not for me .
marge simpson|i wanted you to wear that dress at your wedding .
marge simpson|homer , your daughter doesn't want to get married .
marge simpson|tell her she's wrong !
marge simpson|sorry maggie , i just don't have the touch today .
marge simpson|how ?
marge simpson|thank you for finding it , sweetie .
marge simpson|and seeing someone else get married in it is better than having it myself .
marge simpson|we can have the reception at wong lee's !
marge simpson|fine .
marge simpson|what would you get rid of ?
marge simpson|fine .
marge simpson|i'll just get rid of these itchy and mitchys .

marge simpson|why don't we take moe on a road trip ?
marge simpson|moe , this trip is about turning your life around .
marge simpson|maybe i should come too .
marge simpson|grampa's in charge of you kids while we go to capital city .
marge simpson|bart , you're in charge of grampa .
marge simpson|moe , i know things haven't been easy for you .
marge simpson|but you're with people who love you in the most exciting of the twin cities .
marge simpson|so what do you say , moe ?
marge simpson|will you give me a smile ?
marge simpson|thatta boy .
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|'cause every time you wear it you'll know how much we love you .
marge simpson|like the one pair of blue pants i bought homer twenty years ago .
marge simpson|oh moe , this suit really brings out the herringbone in your eyes !
marge simpson|no husband of mine is wearing a tent !
marge simpson|and look over there , moe .
marge simpson|every time i call grampa's phone , i get no answer .
marge simpson|oh , good .
marge simpson|he needs his sleep .

marge simpson|you could take advantage of a fantastic musician living right here !
marge simpson|that's okay .
marge simpson|i ...
marge simpson|let's go , bart ...
marge simpson|so , how much are lessons ?
marge simpson|you'd better be asking for something p .

marge simpson|pie or cake .
marge simpson|there might be some nagging involved .

marge simpson|hands at ten and two .
marge simpson|okay , let's try again .
marge simpson|lesson over .
marge simpson|what are you doing ?
marge simpson|stop making putin jokes !
marge simpson|ugh .
marge simpson|speaking of police ...

marge simpson|i am so proud .
marge simpson|i would've been happy if bart was just a piano mover .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|bart , i've never been so proud of you .
marge simpson|never , never , never !

marge simpson|gulp ?
marge simpson|was that a gulp ?
marge simpson|are you getting a sore throat ?
marge simpson|let me give you some castor oil .

marge simpson|i know it .
marge simpson|wrong .
marge simpson|is it your impression of mr burns eating soup ?
marge simpson|because i'm not in the mood .
marge simpson|i always wondered what you were hiding under your curly locks , my beautiful yellow melon !
marge simpson|confidence is so attractive in a man .

marge simpson|i still can't believe it was carl who took your winnings .
marge simpson|i thought it would have been you , or you , or you .
marge simpson|maybe he had a good reason to give you the ultimate screwover .
marge simpson|you don't know where carl is from ?
marge simpson|maybe if you'd talked less about guy stuff you'd know more about your socalled friend .
marge simpson|you're going so far away .
marge simpson|i'll miss you .
marge simpson|we're not broken !
marge simpson|oh , that's perfect .

marge simpson|accidental motherhood is the greatest thing that can happen to a woman .

marge simpson|i just put all my personal information on their website !
marge simpson|so many unhappy men .
marge simpson|how sad .
marge simpson|selma , cheating is a sin .

marge simpson|homer's probably at that bar right now , getting hammered .
marge simpson|well , he keeps falling down a cliff and living , so i guess that's true .
marge simpson|ooh , i love that show !
marge simpson|such great characters , like buxton the scheming larderkeep .
marge simpson|why can't lady cavendish see he's pilfering the aspic ?
marge simpson|he says shows set during world war one are too sad .
marge simpson|particularly how everyone's always climbing stairs .
marge simpson|yeah .
marge simpson|alone , i'm sure .

marge simpson|hello !

marge simpson|i have no regrets about that .
marge simpson|it was a perfect pregnancy .
marge simpson|didn't smoke , didn't drink , lost three pounds .
marge simpson|and every night before bed , homer would give me a little kiss ...
marge simpson|music .
marge simpson|could bart have been prenatally screwed up by the kiss music ?
marge simpson|you gotta lose your mind in detroit rock city !
marge simpson|well , for some reason it relaxes me .
marge simpson|now do that thing gene simmons does .
marge simpson|must find way ...
marge simpson|to blame myself .
marge simpson|lumbar !
marge simpson|it means lower back .
marge simpson|how many times will you make that mistake ?
marge simpson|just put on the kiss record .
marge simpson|anything from love gun !
marge simpson|it's bart !
marge simpson|chief , what are you doing to save our son ?
marge simpson|it's all my fault .
marge simpson|i should never have listened to those kiss albums when i was pregnant .
marge simpson|really ?
marge simpson|can we focus on my son ?
marge simpson|up in the sky ?
marge simpson|you know what i think about regrets ?
marge simpson|feels like this play date's gone on forever .
marge simpson|did you eat a peanut ?
marge simpson|yolo ?
marge simpson|kirk van houten , i hope you're not having a midlife crisis .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , but does kirk know how silly he looks ?
marge simpson|oh homie , i'm so glad you're happy with your life just the way it is .
marge simpson|you've had the same job , same car , same house for twenty years .
marge simpson|and that's all you'll ever have .

marge simpson|and you're okay with it !
marge simpson|like i say night after night after night nightynight .

marge simpson|postage , marked in pesetas ?
marge simpson|who are those letters from ?
marge simpson|marge simpson !
marge simpson|homie , i thought a visit from your old pen pal would cheer you up .
marge simpson|ooh !
marge simpson|i'm not used to strange men saying the word bedroom around me .
marge simpson|that's even worse .
marge simpson|could you say it one more time ?
marge simpson|ooh !
marge simpson|they rented everything from comic book guy for ten bucks .
marge simpson|if you're happy i'm happy .
marge simpson|i feel kind of ...
marge simpson|melancholy ...
marge simpson|that's not helping .
marge simpson|jumping on the bed .
marge simpson|but i never disobeyed my parents , till i married you .
marge simpson|i'm a little tired .
marge simpson|could we just snuggle again ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|it's me , talking in your earphone !

marge simpson|none of it's good !
marge simpson|that is pretty good .
marge simpson|so then you delivered her baby right there in the elevator .
marge simpson|well i'm glad you did a good deed , but you shouldn't come here again .
marge simpson|i thought that was strange poop on your collar .
marge simpson|you know what ?
marge simpson|i think it's fine if homer spends a few hours now and then with ...
marge simpson|homer junior .
marge simpson|it's true , i never specified the home .
marge simpson|late night at moe's eh ?

marge simpson|so i got us all tickets to see the circus on saturday .
marge simpson|i thought you were going to try to relax .
marge simpson|homer , i have to use the porta potty .
marge simpson|no woman uses one of these by choice .
marge simpson|what did you give him ?
marge simpson|my husband can't really think he's ten .
marge simpson|so what do we do ?
marge simpson|well , i guess it'll have to be in bart's room .
marge simpson|and i thought when homer cut off his thumb was bad .

marge simpson|homie , i've missed you !
marge simpson|oh , so good to have you back .

marge simpson|he chose to spend the night in a jail with strangers instead of with me .
marge simpson|kids ?

marge simpson|or keep arguing .
marge simpson|i don't care .
marge simpson|homer , i'm sorry i tried to help you control your weight .
marge simpson|i'm not sure of anything anymore .
marge simpson|sorry i ever open my mouth .
marge simpson|how can you follow a leader who won't even get up out of his chair ?
marge simpson|it's not that professor x wouldn't get up , it's that he couldn't .
marge simpson|absolutely .
marge simpson|it's because everything you love , you love so much .
marge simpson|i've printed out our driving plan !
marge simpson|if we work together , we can get bart to his sports ...

marge simpson|it's okay to have a feminine side .
marge simpson|it's good in fact !
marge simpson|whatever you want .
marge simpson|moe , i think we'd both be a lot happier if we quit our new jobs .
marge simpson|he's not my lover !
marge simpson|yup .
marge simpson|and i know a place that could use this smile .
marge simpson|lenny said you were babysitting .

marge simpson|i could use a night out .
marge simpson|really ?
marge simpson|awag ?
marge simpson|really ?
marge simpson|majesty .
marge simpson|well , not all of them .
marge simpson|like , um , ninety percent ?
marge simpson|i hope no one was hurt .
marge simpson|but you don't go to our church .
marge simpson|apu thinks we can get the money at the casino playing blackjack .
marge simpson|and it's not even against the rules .
marge simpson|not even homer ?
marge simpson|even i saw that .
marge simpson|i guess i can't tell homer .

marge simpson|actually ...
marge simpson|my friends and i are using a system to win money to save the church .
marge simpson|it's not gambling !
marge simpson|it's math .
marge simpson|it's not a takedown !
marge simpson|and i haven't told him about it yet .
marge simpson|i'll tell your dad everything in the morning when we have the money .
marge simpson|but until then , i appreciate you keeping this very grownup secret .
marge simpson|homie , homie , i can finally tell you how we really got the money ...
marge simpson|this is all my fault .
marge simpson|homie .
marge simpson|how did you end up at the casino ?
marge simpson|reverend !
marge simpson|reverend !
marge simpson|they took homer !

marge simpson|god didn't do this .
marge simpson|i lied to my husband , and made my kids lie too !
marge simpson|we did this .
marge simpson|i'm going to do what i should've done in the first place .
marge simpson|maybe we got it all wrong praying for things we want and hoping we get them .
marge simpson|my family loves your microwave lasagnas .
marge simpson|i want my husband back !
marge simpson|they sure did ...
marge simpson|casino management .
marge simpson|but we don't need to come back .
marge simpson|we saved the church .

marge simpson|well , bart , i hope you're going straight to the principal about this .
marge simpson|what on earth are you talking about , homer ?

marge simpson|bart , instead of fighting , why don't you try a little understanding ?
marge simpson|shh !
marge simpson|this bully friend of yours ...
marge simpson|is he a little on the chunky side ?
marge simpson|huh huh .
marge simpson|and i'll bet he doesn't do well in his studies either .
marge simpson|that's why he lashes out at the world .
marge simpson|so tomorrow , instead of bickering with this boy , talk to him .
marge simpson|you'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go .
marge simpson|are you boys through playing war ?
marge simpson|good .
marge simpson|then here are some cupcakes .
marge simpson|oh , homer , you'd lose your head if it weren't securely fastened to your neck .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , everybody .

marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|but they sent a note from school .
marge simpson|no , bart .

marge simpson|this is important .
marge simpson|i want you to smile today .

marge simpson|ah , that's my girl .
marge simpson|lisa , i apologize to you .

marge simpson|i said you could stop smiling , lisa .
marge simpson|boys , i'd like your attention , please .

marge simpson|lisa has an idea that she thinks would be fun for the whole family .
marge simpson|we're just browsing , thank you .
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|i'm not sure that we can afford ...
marge simpson|i don't think we can afford this , homer .
marge simpson|it all seems so expensive ...
marge simpson|used , isn't it ?
marge simpson|what are you two doing back there ?
marge simpson|homer , i'm telling you this is not the interstate .
marge simpson|shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for directions ?
marge simpson|my feet are getting wet !
marge simpson|we all are , dear .
marge simpson|your father says there's nothing to worry about .
marge simpson|oh , homer .
marge simpson|what are we going to do ?
marge simpson|it is ?
marge simpson|oh , i don't think they'll be gone long and she's in good hands , lisa .
marge simpson|the boys certainly are taking a long time .
marge simpson|i hope maggie isn't slowing them up too much .
marge simpson|oh , i'm sure they're just fine .
marge simpson|after all , we built a fire and we don't know anything about nature .
marge simpson|imagine what your father , an experienced woodsman , has done .
marge simpson|goodnight , dear .
marge simpson|there is ?
marge simpson|why ...
marge simpson|that's my husband !
marge simpson|his name isn't bigfoot .
marge simpson|his name is homer .
marge simpson|i don't understand .
marge simpson|what's this all about ?
marge simpson|well , i suppose pork chops are his favorite .
marge simpson|is this going to be on tv ?
marge simpson|cheer up , homer .

marge simpson|can you believe this , homer ?
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|were you planning on sitting in the car till the game was over ?

marge simpson|now , move it !
marge simpson|yeah .
marge simpson|sit down , homer .
marge simpson|gambling .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|look , i don't want to talk about this anymore in front of the kids .
marge simpson|lisa , bart , what did you two learn in sunday school today ?
marge simpson|no way , jose .
marge simpson|um mmm .
marge simpson|i know what those movies are like .
marge simpson|killing innocent people , eating human flesh .
marge simpson|you just get a lot of bad ideas .
marge simpson|bart , are you all right ?
marge simpson|well then come down for breakfast .
marge simpson|it's a statue of the trailblazing founder of our town .
marge simpson|go on , lisa .
marge simpson|we've all got to be brave just like jebediah when he killed that bear .
marge simpson|why , bart , why ?
marge simpson|where did you get a ridiculous idea like that ?
marge simpson|homer , did you have something to do with this ?
marge simpson|a little ?
marge simpson|well , isn't this nice ?
marge simpson|no , homer .
marge simpson|it's mine .

marge simpson|the holes were drilled for your fingers .
marge simpson|you never intended for me to use that ball .
marge simpson|you can't take it back .

marge simpson|you know , just to check on the kids ?
marge simpson|homer , wake up .

marge simpson|here you go , bart .
marge simpson|homer ...
marge simpson|homer ...

marge simpson|did the team ask you to dress like that , homer ?
marge simpson|a simpson on a tshirt .
marge simpson|i never thought i'd see the day .
marge simpson|homer , i'd be lying if i didn't say that this scares me a little .
marge simpson|but we all have a calling , a reason the almighty put us on this earth .
marge simpson|and yours might be to dance on dugouts .
marge simpson|let's do it , homer !

marge simpson|i don't know .
marge simpson|would you like some fruit juice ?
marge simpson|now stop it you two .
marge simpson|and don't look too down .
marge simpson|i'm sure this is hard enough for your father .

marge simpson|bart's busy working on his science project .
marge simpson|homie , quit tossing .
marge simpson|what exactly did he say ?
marge simpson|well , how did he say it ?
marge simpson|was he angry ?
marge simpson|was he rude ?
marge simpson|well , he's not perfect , but he is very ...

marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|i wish this family was as close as the flanders .
marge simpson|hmmm .
marge simpson|i was going to wash my hair .
marge simpson|you brought food ...
marge simpson|homer , i couldn't help overhearing you warp bart's mind .
marge simpson|well , i'm sure it is , but why do we want to do that ?
marge simpson|now i suppose you both have to sign this .
marge simpson|i hope blood won't be necessary .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|here you go , bart .
marge simpson|a lumberjack's breakfast for my little golfer .

marge simpson|we were so worried !
marge simpson|bart , isn't there something you'd like to say to your sister ?

marge simpson|a dash of rosemary ...
marge simpson|a smidgin of thyme ...
marge simpson|a pinch of marjoram ...
marge simpson|oh now , homer , they're nothing special .
marge simpson|the extra ingredient is care .
marge simpson|a sprinkle of chervil , half a teaspoon of turmeric ...
marge simpson|and a whisper of msg .
marge simpson|you don't have to go to all that trouble just for me .
marge simpson|humph ...
marge simpson|where would an innocent child get the idea to attack her father with a mallet ?
marge simpson|no , maggie !
marge simpson|bad baby !
marge simpson|so television's responsible .
marge simpson|well , you won't be watching these cartoons anymore .
marge simpson|ever .
marge simpson|i wonder why bart and lisa are so late getting home from school ?
marge simpson|because .
marge simpson|because i said so .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|i'm trying to work !
marge simpson|i'm cataloguing the violence in these cartoons .
marge simpson|i don't think adults have ever actually sat down and watched them before .
marge simpson|what kind of warped human being would find that funny ?
marge simpson|this is the kind of entertainment they think is suitable for younger and more impressionable viewers ?
marge simpson|i'll tell you what i'm going to do .
marge simpson|i'm going to write a letter .
marge simpson|dear purveyors of senseless violence i know this may sound silly at first ...
marge simpson|please try to tone down the psychotic violence ...
marge simpson|in your otherwise fine programming .
marge simpson|yours truly , marge simpson .
marge simpson|and the horse i rode in on !
marge simpson|well , that's what we want them to do , homer .
marge simpson|but if enough people take an interest ...
marge simpson|snuh !
marge simpson|for nonviolence , understanding and helping .
marge simpson|i've started a crusade against cartoon violence .
marge simpson|i can protect my own children .
marge simpson|but there are many others whose minds are being warped every afternoon at four .
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|have fun .
marge simpson|and what happens when a child grows up with insanely violent role models like these ?
marge simpson|the answer is all around you .
marge simpson|how many of you were hit on the head with mallets last week ?
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i'm sorry about the dinners .
marge simpson|i'll make up for it tomorrow night .

marge simpson|couldn't itchy share his pie with scratchy ?
marge simpson|then they would both have pie .
marge simpson|it's time for krusty .
marge simpson|yes , dear .
marge simpson|all you want .
marge simpson|i think it conveys a very nice message of sharing .
marge simpson|aren't you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons ?
marge simpson|so what did you kids do today ?
marge simpson|that's nice dear .
marge simpson|sure .
marge simpson|i didn't really expect things to change this much .
marge simpson|what in the world ?
marge simpson|hmmm , but that's michelangelo's david .
marge simpson|it's a masterpiece !
marge simpson|but i like that statue .
marge simpson|i'm not .
marge simpson|i think everyone in springfield should see it .
marge simpson|hmmm ...
marge simpson|yes and no .
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|i guess i can't , which is a shame because i really hate those cartoons .
marge simpson|um , i don't know .
marge simpson|david .
marge simpson|oh , homie .
marge simpson|really , why ?
marge simpson|aw , well isn't that nice .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|oh , bart !
marge simpson|we thought for a minute you'd gone away from us .
marge simpson|mr hutz , this is hardly the time or place to discuss this .
marge simpson|is he well enough for me to start mothering him unbearably , doctor ?
marge simpson|hmmm .
marge simpson|oh !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|that's right , he did .
marge simpson|well , maybe lisa does have a point .
marge simpson|i didn't know you liked animals .
marge simpson|goodness !
marge simpson|i don't know .
marge simpson|maybe we should take his money and put all this ugliness behind us .
marge simpson|what do you think , homer ?
marge simpson|homer , what's happened to you ?
marge simpson|do you know what i'd settle for if it was up to me ?
marge simpson|bart's medical bills and an apology !
marge simpson|yes , i do .
marge simpson|he's seen us through everything from colds to impetigo with competence and loving care .
marge simpson|and he mispronounced words that even i know , like abdomen .
marge simpson|and his office was dirty .
marge simpson|now that i think about it , i'm not sure he's even a doctor .
marge simpson|well , i don't know how intense it was ...
marge simpson|so i guess that may not count as anguish .
marge simpson|all that time .
marge simpson|well , we pay bart five dollars a week to take out the trash ...
marge simpson|umhmm .
marge simpson|homer , would you like some more macaroni and cheese ?
marge simpson|some string beans ?
marge simpson|some celery with cream cheese on it ?
marge simpson|bart , please .
marge simpson|sure .
marge simpson|my woman's intuition is telling me something ...
marge simpson|i wonder what ...
marge simpson|oh my god .
marge simpson|my name is marge .
marge simpson|homer , i'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing .
marge simpson|what are you saying , homer ?
marge simpson|oh my lord .
marge simpson|i think that you should look me in the eyes and find out .
marge simpson|homer , look at me .
marge simpson|i love you too !
marge simpson|your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds , homer .
marge simpson|get it while it's unbelievably hot , kids !
marge simpson|well , maybe lisa's right .
marge simpson|tomorrow night it might be nice to go out for dinner .
marge simpson|there's that new sushi restaurant on elm street .
marge simpson|please , homer .
marge simpson|can't we try it ?
marge simpson|what would you recommend for a family that's not sure they should be here ?
marge simpson|i'll have one of those .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , homer .
marge simpson|have you thought about what you want to tell the kids ?
marge simpson|well , have you decided what you want to do tomorrow ?
marge simpson|when we're intimate ?
marge simpson|can i just make one suggestion ?
marge simpson|can we get up early and watch the sunrise together ?
marge simpson|you looked so peaceful lying there .
marge simpson|because sometimes it's fun to dress up for dinner .
marge simpson|because sometimes it's fun to use the good china .
marge simpson|sometimes it's fun to use candles .
marge simpson|because we love your father and enjoy his company .
marge simpson|oh , where can he be ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|i wrote a poem for you this afternoon , homer .
marge simpson|it's called , to a husband .
marge simpson|ahem .
marge simpson|the blackened clouds are forming ...
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|oh , homer , homer .
marge simpson|his drool !

marge simpson|homer , homer , wake up , you're alive !
marge simpson|wake up !
marge simpson|you're alive !
marge simpson|you're alive !
marge simpson|you're alive !
marge simpson|i think this is sick .
marge simpson|they're staring at a dot !
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|it's not the end of the world .
marge simpson|you know , before we got married we hardly ever watched television .
marge simpson|no , it's true , bart .
marge simpson|we used to shoot pool ...
marge simpson|and go dancing ...
marge simpson|and a lot of times we'd stay at home and talk , just like this .
marge simpson|pick one .
marge simpson|uh ...
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|lisa , i'd rather tell you a different story .
marge simpson|how your father and i first met and fell in love .
marge simpson|we were seniors in high school , but we had never even met .
marge simpson|i'm for equal rights .
marge simpson|but do we really need a whole amendment ?
marge simpson|not if i have to do heavy lifting or math .
marge simpson|oh , the shop kids are smoking again .
marge simpson|the first step to liberation is to free ourselves from these ...
marge simpson|male imposed shackles .
marge simpson|hm , i guess it's the tissue paper inside .
marge simpson|well , no i don't .
marge simpson|actually , i never really ...
marge simpson|excuse me , is this room 106 ?
marge simpson|i'm a political prisoner .
marge simpson|last time i ever take a stand .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , i don't even know your name .
marge simpson|bringing up a son , even a blind one , isn't a lifetime occupation .
marge simpson|now , the more you help him ...
marge simpson|the more you hurt him .
marge simpson|well thank you , artie .
marge simpson|hello .
marge simpson|yes , i remember .
marge simpson|well , i don't think you're my type .

marge simpson|and you kept me here until one a .
marge simpson|m .
marge simpson|pretending to be stupid .
marge simpson|homer j .

marge simpson|homer !

marge simpson|homer , we talked about cable before .
marge simpson|do you really think we can afford it ?
marge simpson|are you sure this is legal ?
marge simpson|myth it's only fair to pay for quality firstrun movies .
marge simpson|fact most movies shown on cable get two stars or less and are repeated ad nauseam .
marge simpson|hmm , well , i don't know .
marge simpson|ooh .
marge simpson|that's a good idea .
marge simpson|aren't you ready for church , homer ?

marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|i ate two grapes .
marge simpson|please charge me for them .

marge simpson|maybe we should think about unhooking the cable .
marge simpson|well , then maybe you should pay for it .
marge simpson|but homer , i'm afraid that cable has become an evil presence in our home .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|oh , homer .
marge simpson|no , homer , not over this .
marge simpson|no , no .

marge simpson|to be called up whenever and for whatever reason i desire .
marge simpson|not to me .
marge simpson|i want you to find a husband for my sister selma .
marge simpson|it's patty who chose the life of celibacy .
marge simpson|selma simply had celibacy thrust upon her .

marge simpson|oh dear .
marge simpson|i knew it .
marge simpson|well , lisa , here it is ;
marge simpson|the bouvier family quilt .
marge simpson|for five generations , women in our family have each added a square to it .
marge simpson|now it's your turn .
marge simpson|oh yes , you do .
marge simpson|you just don't know it .
marge simpson|the memory of a million dropstitches flows in your veins .
marge simpson|you try it .
marge simpson|you just need to develop a callous .
marge simpson|see ?
marge simpson|you see .
marge simpson|now that's a sewing finger , honey .
marge simpson|this one's mine .
marge simpson|i didn't know then , and i don't know now .
marge simpson|those are very elaborate sneakers .
marge simpson|a hundred and twentyfive dollars !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|i thought we agreed to consult each other before any major purchases .
marge simpson|well , homer .
marge simpson|there seems to be a lot of good obedience schools here .
marge simpson|oooh , this one looks very reputable .
marge simpson|oh , i don't know , i just dip in and out ...
marge simpson|ohh , that dog !
marge simpson|i don't know .
marge simpson|hm .
marge simpson|come on , homer .
marge simpson|i want you to see what your sick little girl did .
marge simpson|my quilt !
marge simpson|six generations , gone .
marge simpson|homer , what are you saying ?
marge simpson|no , i'm afraid i agree with your father .
marge simpson|homer , please .
marge simpson|it's not just the quilt .
marge simpson|he's a nice dog , but he chews up everything .
marge simpson|he doesn't obey .
marge simpson|he's not even housebroken .
marge simpson|and we've spent all this money on an obedience school and i don't see any improvement .
marge simpson|oh , all right .
marge simpson|if he passes obedience school , we can keep him .
marge simpson|homer , can't we place this ad after the dog fails his test ?
marge simpson|hmmm , what are you doing , dear ?
marge simpson|aww .
marge simpson|well , you certainly captured the moment .
marge simpson|hmmm .
marge simpson|say goodbye to grampa , everyone .
marge simpson|homer , that's terrible .
marge simpson|we should be teaching the children to treasure the elderly .
marge simpson|you know , we'll be old someday .
marge simpson|well , i think we better set an example .
marge simpson|well , i always enjoy the glass blower at old springfield towne .
marge simpson|dad , don't you want to know where we're going ?
marge simpson|hello .
marge simpson|homer , are you sure this is the right way ?
marge simpson|the road seems to have gotten awfully bumpy .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer , this thing with your dad has had you moping around the house for days .
marge simpson|i think it's time for you to talk to someone who understands .
marge simpson|homer , that suit doesn't leave much to the imagination .
marge simpson|no , maggie !
marge simpson|stay in the shallow end .
marge simpson|now homer , you do have big bones .
marge simpson|oh , homer , don't be jealous .
marge simpson|now , homer .
marge simpson|we've got steamed vegetables and rice cakes for you .
marge simpson|now , they're only thirtyfive calories apiece .
marge simpson|you can put a little something on top for flavor .
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|but mr schindler ...
marge simpson|i never got any .
marge simpson|and i never painted again .
marge simpson|i think it's a very nice idea .
marge simpson|don't you , homer ?
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|apu !
marge simpson|what are you doing here ?
marge simpson|clever title .
marge simpson|oh , lisa , this was a bad idea .
marge simpson|do you really think so ?

marge simpson|then i'm in the class ?
marge simpson|well , thank you , professor lombardo .
marge simpson|really ?
marge simpson|you're so supportive .
marge simpson|i wish every teacher was like you .
marge simpson|i can't believe it .

marge simpson|kids .
marge simpson|remember what i told you about showing a little support .
marge simpson|mr burns .
marge simpson|would you like to come in ?
marge simpson|well , no ...
marge simpson|just ringo starr .
marge simpson|i don't think that will be a problem .
marge simpson|i'm painting his portrait , homer .
marge simpson|now , homer , don't worry .
marge simpson|all i need to do is find mr burns' inner beauty .
marge simpson|what were you like as a boy , mr burns ?
marge simpson|did you have a dog that you loved .
marge simpson|mr burns , she's just a baby .
marge simpson|oh , my .
marge simpson|i'm so sorry , mr burns .
marge simpson|doesn't it bother you that he orders you around like that ?
marge simpson|that's wonderful homer , i'm so proud of ...
marge simpson|mr burns , i've had enough of your ...
marge simpson|posing .
marge simpson|i can finish the portrait myself .
marge simpson|homer , what are you doing ?
marge simpson|don't you listen to him .
marge simpson|he's just a mean little s .
marge simpson|o .
marge simpson|b .
marge simpson|i thought there was some good in everybody until i met him .
marge simpson|i don't think i can .
marge simpson|i can't make that man beautiful .
marge simpson|i'm just not good enough .
marge simpson|i guess i'm no artist .
marge simpson|from the desk of ringo starr !
marge simpson|okay , homer .
marge simpson|if you think i can .
marge simpson|umm ...
marge simpson|hello .
marge simpson|my name is marge simpson and i painted this .
