lisa simpson|so i guess you're gonna have to bite the bullet and confess to milhouse .
lisa simpson|we leapt off just in time to see it collapse .
lisa simpson|this award is the biggest farce i ever saw .
lisa simpson|i stand corrected .
lisa simpson|dad , you know you won .
lisa simpson|dad ?
lisa simpson|dad ?
lisa simpson|unky herb !
lisa simpson|why didn't you write , unky herb ?
lisa simpson|i see your point .
lisa simpson|and while on ventnor avenue you'll be staying at the fabulous hotel lisa .
lisa simpson|a valet will be around shortly to park your thimble .
lisa simpson|of course , there is the unpleasant matter of the bill .
lisa simpson|eleven hundred and fifty bones .
lisa simpson|look at this ad from new republic for kids .
lisa simpson|maggie !
lisa simpson|maggie !
lisa simpson|i think we owe a debt to unky herb .
lisa simpson|he took us into his home and dad destroyed him .
lisa simpson|peekaboo !
lisa simpson|finally , a copy of ethan frome to call my own .
lisa simpson|no , dad .
lisa simpson|you promised if bart and i got c averages we could go to kamp krusty .
lisa simpson|and with no false modesty , you're looking at one happy camper .
lisa simpson|i've never gotten a b before .

lisa simpson|i feel so dirty .
lisa simpson|uh .
lisa simpson|uh ...
lisa simpson|uh .
lisa simpson|the dirt's not coming off .
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|calm down .
lisa simpson|this must just be a little typo .
lisa simpson|oh miss hoover , there appears to be a mistake on my report card .
lisa simpson|you gave me a b+ in conduct .
lisa simpson|perhaps i'm not making myself clear .
lisa simpson|i think you should reconsider .
lisa simpson|so , bart , will you be joining me in the bucolic splendor of kamp krusty ?
lisa simpson|a+ !
lisa simpson|oh , bart , why didn't you at least forge plausible grades ?

lisa simpson|this is a little more rustic than i expected .
lisa simpson|are you sure that's safe ?
lisa simpson|you're serving us gruel ?
lisa simpson|i feel like i'm gonna die , bart .
lisa simpson|i meant soon .
lisa simpson|our nature hikes have become grim death marches .
lisa simpson|our arts and crafts center is , in actuality , a dickensian workhouse .
lisa simpson|but i am far more pessimistic .
lisa simpson|and now the effort of writing has made me lightheaded .
lisa simpson|so i close by saying , save us !

lisa simpson|i'm an ugmo .
lisa simpson|fathers have to say that stuff .
lisa simpson|i'd like to be alone , please .

lisa simpson|one !
lisa simpson|two !
lisa simpson|three !
lisa simpson|four !
lisa simpson|left a good job in the city workin' for the man every night and day ...
lisa simpson|i'd say the greater danger is her scepter acting as a lightning rod .
lisa simpson|unless it's made out of plastic .
lisa simpson|hi fellas .
lisa simpson|i'm going to be riding on a pack of cigarettes ?
lisa simpson|i don't want to be a spokesperson for a cigarette company !
lisa simpson|stop this float !
lisa simpson|i'm tired of being a corporate shill .
lisa simpson|from now i will speak out against the evils in society from dog napping to cigarettes .
lisa simpson|dad , do you remember why you entered me in that pageant ?
lisa simpson|possibly .

lisa simpson|this is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man .
lisa simpson|do you think you can get the dental plan back ?
lisa simpson|mmmm .
lisa simpson|uh huh .
lisa simpson|the mirror .
lisa simpson|the mirror !
lisa simpson|and that's the tooth !
lisa simpson|like halloween and christmas , april fool's day traces its origins to pagan ritual .
lisa simpson|april first used to be the pagan new year .
lisa simpson|the christians changed their calendar and ridiculed those who didn't .
lisa simpson|now who's laughing ?
lisa simpson|now who's laughing ?
lisa simpson|dad !

lisa simpson|you were in that coma for seven weeks .
lisa simpson|it's so sad that krusty is ashamed of his roots .
lisa simpson|lois sanborn .
lisa simpson|this is a rather lifeless outing .
lisa simpson|that's as bad as the tasteless itchy and sambo cartoons of the late 30s .
lisa simpson|the writers should be ashamed of themselves .
lisa simpson|yeah , sort of .
lisa simpson|write a cartoon ourselves ?
lisa simpson|bart , are you thinking what i'm thinking ?
lisa simpson|according to this book , the first thing we need is a setting .

lisa simpson|bart , they rejected our script .
lisa simpson|maybe he just doesn't take us seriously 'cause we're kids .
lisa simpson|let's put a grownup's name on it .

lisa simpson|grampa , how'd you take off your underwear without taking off your pants ?
lisa simpson|bart !

lisa simpson|i guess nobody likes the truth , huh grampa .

lisa simpson|i knew it .

lisa simpson|is it my imagination or is tv getting worse ?

lisa simpson|doesn't my father have the right to a fair trial ?
lisa simpson|dad , i wouldn't go outside if i were you .

lisa simpson|nosferatu !
lisa simpson|das wampyre !
lisa simpson|a vampire !
lisa simpson|ah , there's something fishy about this whole setup .
lisa simpson|dad , do you notice anything strange ?
lisa simpson|eww , dad , this is blood .

lisa simpson|um ...
lisa simpson|uh , well ...
lisa simpson|uh ...
lisa simpson|are you mad ?
lisa simpson|we know , dad .
lisa simpson|what !
lisa simpson|this is madness .
lisa simpson|he's just peddling a bunch of easy answers .
lisa simpson|is that why you're sitting on an ice cream sandwich ?
lisa simpson|it's simple , bart .
lisa simpson|you've defined yourself as a rebel .
lisa simpson|and in the absence of a repressive milieu , your societal niche has been coopted .
lisa simpson|ever since that selfhelp guy came to town , you've lost your identity .
lisa simpson|you've fallen through the cracks of our quickfix , onehourphoto , instantoatmeal society .
lisa simpson|well , this is your chance to develop a new and better identity .
lisa simpson|may i suggest goodnatured doormat ?
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|selfimprovement can be achieved , but not with a quickfix .
lisa simpson|it's a long , arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery .
lisa simpson|dad , sit down .
lisa simpson|tsk , tsk .
lisa simpson|the remorse of the sugar junkie .
lisa simpson|really ?
lisa simpson|not even this ?
lisa simpson|the few , the proud , the geeky .
lisa simpson|oh , bart , cartoons don't have to be one hundred percent realistic .
lisa simpson|dad , look , i made fish sticks .
lisa simpson|they're burned on the outside , but they're frozen on the inside so it balances out .
lisa simpson|dad , why are you singing ?
lisa simpson|are you hiding something from me ?
lisa simpson|judging from your song , you're infatuated with a woman named mindy ...
lisa simpson|or a man named andy .
lisa simpson|dad , i'm not gonna fall for that .
lisa simpson|huh ?
lisa simpson|dad , you shouldn't wear glasses that weren't prescribed for you .
lisa simpson|gimme those .
lisa simpson|excuse me , mr mayor .
lisa simpson|this piggy bank contains fifteen dollars i've saved from my allowance .
lisa simpson|it isn't much , but i would like to help .
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|nevada makes my butt look big .
lisa simpson|dad , what do you think ?
lisa simpson|do you get the feeling this family is disintegrating ?
lisa simpson|i mean we haven't had a meal with mom all week .
lisa simpson|and she hasn't even started my costume for the geography pageant .
lisa simpson|there's nothing to eat for breakfast .
lisa simpson|maybe mom just doesn't realize we miss her .
lisa simpson|we could go down to the casino and let her know .
lisa simpson|mommm !
lisa simpson|i just had a bad dream .
lisa simpson|does this mean you'll help me with my costume ?
lisa simpson|thanks , mom .
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|i'm not a state , i'm a monster !
lisa simpson|wake up , dad !
lisa simpson|wake up !
lisa simpson|there was a burglar and he took my saxophone .
lisa simpson|you had a stamp collection ?
lisa simpson|bart's pain is funny , but mine isn't .
lisa simpson|that saxophone was my one creative outlet .
lisa simpson|it was the only way i could truly express myself .
lisa simpson|we are insured , aren't we , mom ?
lisa simpson|what's the point of all these precautions ?
lisa simpson|i've already lost the only thing that matters to me .
lisa simpson|what , this jug ?
lisa simpson|thank you .
lisa simpson|dad , don't you see you're abusing your power like all vigilantes ?
lisa simpson|i mean , if you're the police , who will police the police ?
lisa simpson|and i still don't have my saxophone .
lisa simpson|world domination ?
lisa simpson|dad , maybe this will cheer you up .
lisa simpson|oh , grampa .

lisa simpson|impaled on my nobel peace prize .
lisa simpson|how ironic .
lisa simpson|why ?
lisa simpson|i'm so much happier here .
lisa simpson|i've got a weekend job helping the poor .
lisa simpson|and i'm only eight .
lisa simpson|this biography of bart came out awfully quickly .
lisa simpson|it's not even about him .
lisa simpson|but inside it's mostly about ross perot .
lisa simpson|and the last two chapters are excerpts from the oliver north trial .
lisa simpson|like what ?
lisa simpson|forget it , dad .
lisa simpson|if anyone wants me i'll be in my room .
lisa simpson|dad , you should blow the whistle on the kwikemart .
lisa simpson|dad , are you listening to me ?
lisa simpson|i can see through time .
lisa simpson|mmm corn .
lisa simpson|haven't had that in awhile .

lisa simpson|come on , stacy .
lisa simpson|i've waited my whole life to hear you speak .
lisa simpson|don't you have anything relevant to say ?
lisa simpson|it's not funny , bart !
lisa simpson|millions of girls will grow up thinking that this is the right way to act !
lisa simpson|don't you people see anything wrong with what malibu stacy says ?
lisa simpson|no , celeste , i mean the things she says are sexist .
lisa simpson|they cannot keep making dolls like this !
lisa simpson|something has to be done !
lisa simpson|that's it !
lisa simpson|i'm calling the company !
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|we could go on the factory tour and i could complain in person !
lisa simpson|i have one .
lisa simpson|it's awful being a kid .
lisa simpson|no one listens to you .
lisa simpson|action !
lisa simpson|you're getting a job .
lisa simpson|thanks .

lisa simpson|miss lovell ?
lisa simpson|i'd like to talk to you about malibu stacy .
lisa simpson|am i the first ?
lisa simpson|i want you to hear what malibu stacy is telling a generation of little girls .
lisa simpson|change what she says .
lisa simpson|it's your company .
lisa simpson|that's awful !
lisa simpson|i'd be mortified if someone ever made a lousy product with the simpson name on it .
lisa simpson|but if you can learn from malibu stacy's mistakes , so can everyone .
lisa simpson|i'm sure we can think of something together .
lisa simpson|c'mon !
lisa simpson|no you're not !
lisa simpson|uh , i'll come back tomorrow .
lisa simpson|i've got the solution you and i are gonna make our own talking doll .
lisa simpson|and to top it off , the downtoearth good looks of eleanor roosevelt !
lisa simpson|make sure you get my mom's hair just right .
lisa simpson|how about me ?
lisa simpson|when i get married , i'm keeping my own name .
lisa simpson|you know , that should probably be if i choose to get married .
lisa simpson|all right !
lisa simpson|now all we need is a name .
lisa simpson|how about minerva , after the roman goddess of wisdom ?
lisa simpson|this is great !
lisa simpson|they're really gonna sell our doll .
lisa simpson|really ?
lisa simpson|dad , did you hear something ?
lisa simpson|wait !
lisa simpson|don't be fooled !
lisa simpson|she's just a regular malibu stacy with a stupid cheap hat !
lisa simpson|she still embodies all the awful stereotypes she did before .
lisa simpson|well , i guess you can't beat big business .
lisa simpson|there's just no room for the little guy .
lisa simpson|what ?
lisa simpson|how doth the hero , strong and brave , a celestial path in the heavens pave !
lisa simpson|go , dad , go .
lisa simpson|what are you basing that on , mom ?
lisa simpson|come on , dad , you can make it .
lisa simpson|yeah , dad .
lisa simpson|what's so special about this game anyway ?
lisa simpson|it's just another chapter in the pointless rivalry between springfield and shelbyville .
lisa simpson|they built a mini mall so we built a bigger mini mall .
lisa simpson|they made the world's largest pizza so we burnt down their city hall .
lisa simpson|dad and ned flanders friends ?
lisa simpson|what's next ...
lisa simpson|a's on bart's report card ?
lisa simpson|don't worry , bart .
lisa simpson|it seems like every week something odd happens to the simpsons .
lisa simpson|that's the spirit .
lisa simpson|we got the recipe from the fruit punch advisory board .
lisa simpson|yeah .
lisa simpson|maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures .
lisa simpson|hi , mom .
lisa simpson|and i'm going to the park to jam with the little white girls blues quartet .
lisa simpson|wanna come with me , daddyo ?
lisa simpson|me too .
lisa simpson|they're having a great time and i'm stuck in here .
lisa simpson|we won't .
lisa simpson|you all seem to be forgetting the most important thing .
lisa simpson|which is that it's wrong to imprison an animal .
lisa simpson|he's hungry .
lisa simpson|here you go , stampy .
lisa simpson|eat it slow .
lisa simpson|it has to last for ...
lisa simpson|you ate it too fast .
lisa simpson|you can't do that , dad .
lisa simpson|it's cruel .
lisa simpson|he can't just eat peanuts , dad .
lisa simpson|he needs plants to live .
lisa simpson|no , dad .
lisa simpson|he's grooming him .
lisa simpson|taught stampy any tricks yet , bart ?
lisa simpson|i think they're trying to get some attention .
lisa simpson|it's perfect , dad .
lisa simpson|dad , i think he's an ivory dealer .
lisa simpson|mr blackheart ?
lisa simpson|are you an ivory dealer ?
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|bart and stampy are gone !
lisa simpson|i'll bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer , dad .
lisa simpson|a deer !
lisa simpson|dad , how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer ?
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|you're sinking !
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|dad , feline means cat .
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|ow !
lisa simpson|my hair !
lisa simpson|i propose to you that your heir need not be a boy .
lisa simpson|in this phallocentric society of ours ...
lisa simpson|dad , mr burns hasn't passed away yet .
lisa simpson|it couldn't possibly be bottomless .
lisa simpson|hey mom , bart's throwing peas .
lisa simpson|ow !
lisa simpson|that was a big one .
lisa simpson|yeah , me too .
lisa simpson|that midget taught me a lot about his native estonia .
lisa simpson|just take one of my geodes .
lisa simpson|the rocks on my desk .
lisa simpson|no , that's a trilobite ...
lisa simpson|that's petrified wood ...
lisa simpson|muffin .
lisa simpson|that's guilt .
lisa simpson|you feel guilty because your stunt wound up costing a man his job .
lisa simpson|i think you need skinner , bart .
lisa simpson|everybody needs a nemesis .
lisa simpson|sherlock holmes had his dr moriarty .
lisa simpson|mountain dew has its melloyello .
lisa simpson|even maggie has that baby with the one eyebrow .
lisa simpson|they're not imprisoning us , bart .
lisa simpson|they're ...
lisa simpson|otto !
lisa simpson|you started off as the bad cop .
lisa simpson|but now you're the good one .
lisa simpson|you and willie got mixed up about ten minutes ago .
lisa simpson|now you're the good cop .
lisa simpson|how do you know ?
lisa simpson|there weren't any witnesses .
lisa simpson|you'd think someone would have seen something at a crowded party like that .
lisa simpson|you're a witness ?
lisa simpson|bart , you have to tell the police .
lisa simpson|why ?
lisa simpson|oh , i see .
lisa simpson|if you testify , skinner will know you skipped school .
lisa simpson|i knew it was a bad idea to watch him open the mail .
lisa simpson|only because mayor quimby's buying his nephew's freedom .
lisa simpson|chicks on the bench ...
lisa simpson|so bart , have your insides been gnawed away by guilt , yet ?
lisa simpson|maggie , can you point to the credenza ?
lisa simpson|we didn't invite the other babies .
lisa simpson|maggie doesn't seem to get along with the other babies .
lisa simpson|hot dogs / armour hot dogs ...
lisa simpson|what kinds of kids eat armour hot dogs ?
lisa simpson|skinny kids ...
lisa simpson|tough kids ...
lisa simpson|doesn't this family know any songs that aren't commercials ?
lisa simpson|oh .
lisa simpson|that is so cool , that is so exciting , that is so ...
lisa simpson|crappy .
lisa simpson|it looks like part of scratchy's arm .
lisa simpson|yeesh .
lisa simpson|how much was it ?
lisa simpson|oooh .
lisa simpson|where's grampa ?
lisa simpson|wasn't he invited ?
lisa simpson|sneh .
lisa simpson|i think it's great you're a teacher , dad .
lisa simpson|i find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst nightmares .
lisa simpson|me too .
lisa simpson|i'll tell you a secret , bart .
lisa simpson|here , dad .
lisa simpson|i brought you some nice ...
lisa simpson|dad , that's just a plant .
lisa simpson|look , i brought you some nice pudding .
lisa simpson|dad , you can't trick somebody into loving you .
lisa simpson|there's a reason two people come together and stay together .
lisa simpson|there's something they give each other that nobody else can give them .
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|good luck , dad .
lisa simpson|i'm really glad you're back , dad .
lisa simpson|i knew you could do it .
lisa simpson|now don't screw it up .
lisa simpson|ah , face it , bart .
lisa simpson|our salvation isn't just gonna roll by on the back of some stupid truck .
lisa simpson|pool mobile ?
lisa simpson|time's up ?
lisa simpson|dad ...
lisa simpson|dad ...
lisa simpson|dad ...
lisa simpson|dad , as you know , we've been swimming .
lisa simpson|and we've developed a taste for it .
lisa simpson|we both agree that getting our own pool is the only way to go .
lisa simpson|canwehaveapooldad ?
lisa simpson|canwehaveapooldad ?
lisa simpson|canwehaveapooldad ?
lisa simpson|canwehaveapooldad ?
lisa simpson|canwehaveapooldad ?
lisa simpson|canwe ...
lisa simpson|etc .
lisa simpson|yes , dad .
lisa simpson|oh , look .
lisa simpson|bart's all alone .
lisa simpson|maybe i should keep him company , at least for a little while .
lisa simpson|coming !
lisa simpson|dad ...
lisa simpson|you have to put chlorine in the water every day , to keep it clean .
lisa simpson|uh , bart ...
lisa simpson|sorry .
lisa simpson|i just came to see how you were feeling .

lisa simpson|duh , yeah , i'd love to go to your house .
lisa simpson|hello ?
lisa simpson|hey , i'm stuck in here .
lisa simpson|i gotta think of a way to get out .
lisa simpson|bart , i'm really sorry i've been ignoring you lately .
lisa simpson|i got carried away with being popular .
lisa simpson|but now that i'm unpopular again , i want you to know i'm here for you .
lisa simpson|bart , i'm here for you but , i'm not gonna break into somebody's house .
lisa simpson|i'm goin' , i'm goin !
lisa simpson|oh !
lisa simpson|it's my room and i can do what i want .
lisa simpson|bart , quit it !
lisa simpson|mom , i'm auditioning for first chair in the school band and i've got to practice !
lisa simpson|fine .
lisa simpson|i'll play outside .
lisa simpson|sorry , ralph .
lisa simpson|that would defeat the purpose of testing as a means of student evaluation .
lisa simpson|ooh !
lisa simpson|ooh !
lisa simpson|i never made miss hoover yowwee .
lisa simpson|hi , allison ?
lisa simpson|i'm lisa simpson .
lisa simpson|oh , it's great to finally meet someone who converses above the normal eightyearoldlevel .
lisa simpson|you're younger than me , too ?
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|i just like to smell my lunch ...
lisa simpson|gee , i never met anyone who skipped a grade before .
lisa simpson|uh !
lisa simpson|hey , sara !
lisa simpson|well , i gotta go .
lisa simpson|i have to practice for band auditions .
lisa simpson|the sax .
lisa simpson|i'm going for first chair this year .
lisa simpson|wow , with so much in common , i'm sure we'll be the best of friends .
lisa simpson|me , too .
lisa simpson|mom .
lisa simpson|why am i still rotting away in the second grade instead of being skipped ahead ?
lisa simpson|well , did you ever talk to anyone at the school ?
lisa simpson|make a few calls on my behalf ?
lisa simpson|maybe you could've been nicer to principal skinner , if you know what i mean .
lisa simpson|it hurts my teeth .
lisa simpson|and it doesn't have nails and broken glass in it ...
lisa simpson|i won first chair ?
lisa simpson|what's happening ...
lisa simpson|oh ...
lisa simpson|it was just a dream .
lisa simpson|i won first chair ?
lisa simpson|i need help , mom .
lisa simpson|oh i feel so average .
lisa simpson|but she's better than me at everything that makes me special .
lisa simpson|you're thinking of bears , mom .
lisa simpson|i can't tell you either , ralph .
lisa simpson|ah , that used to be my face in the mud ...
lisa simpson|i appreciate the offer , but it goes against every moral fiber in my body .
lisa simpson|i don't need a card .
lisa simpson|you live in the room next to me .
lisa simpson|hey , i am above average !
lisa simpson|so what if allison's ahead of me ?
lisa simpson|there's no shame in being second .
lisa simpson|why would they come to our concert just to boo us ?
lisa simpson|give it to me !
lisa simpson|hey wait , there's nothing bad here .
lisa simpson|i've got to stop being so petty .
lisa simpson|i should be allison's friend , not her competitor .
lisa simpson|i mean , she is a wonderful person .
lisa simpson|i prefer my phrasing .
lisa simpson|you're a wonderful person .
lisa simpson|oh really ?
lisa simpson|i ...
lisa simpson|jeremy's iron .
lisa simpson|what's this ?
lisa simpson|you're finished already ?
lisa simpson|but the competition isn't for weeks .
lisa simpson|it's great .
lisa simpson|it's really great .
lisa simpson|look , bart .
lisa simpson|it almost killed me , but i handcrafted all seventyfive characters from oliver twist .
lisa simpson|and now the coup de grace a bitter snowstorm .
lisa simpson|is it okay ?
lisa simpson|oh who am i kidding ?
lisa simpson|there's no way i'm ever gonna beat allison !
lisa simpson|i'll do whatever it takes .
lisa simpson|relatively ?
lisa simpson|bart , her being wet won't help me win the competition .
lisa simpson|perfect !
lisa simpson|enough with the hose !
lisa simpson|it's the beating of that hideous heart !
lisa simpson|i mean , i think i hear something .
lisa simpson|why , here's allison's real diorama .
lisa simpson|it got misplaced , ...
lisa simpson|or so it would seem .
lisa simpson|after the way i've behaved , i don't deserve to win .
lisa simpson|what ?
lisa simpson|i'm really sorry about what i did , allison .
lisa simpson|it's no shame being second to you .
lisa simpson|only if we're the best .
lisa simpson|hey , ralph .
lisa simpson|want to come with me and allison to play anagrams ?
lisa simpson|not exactly .
lisa simpson|ren and stimpy do it all the time .
lisa simpson|mom , romance is dead .
lisa simpson|it was acquired in a hostile takeover by hallmark and disney .
lisa simpson|homogenized , then sold off piece by piece .
lisa simpson|happy valentine's .
lisa simpson|yes , i do .
lisa simpson|it started appropriately enough with an innocent boy being embarrassed on valentine's day ...
lisa simpson|poor ralph .
lisa simpson|here you go , ralph .
lisa simpson|it was an unusually warm february 14th , so the children walked home without jackets .
lisa simpson|sure , i guess .
lisa simpson|glad you liked it .
lisa simpson|yeah .
lisa simpson|nice gag .
lisa simpson|well , here's my house .
lisa simpson|oh , no .
lisa simpson|it's a package from ralph .
lisa simpson|oh , a malibu stacy convertible !

lisa simpson|he must mean trunk .
lisa simpson|tickets to the krusty anniversary show !
lisa simpson|no , thanks .
lisa simpson|aw .
lisa simpson|oh no .
lisa simpson|please don't show me with ralph .
lisa simpson|noooo !
lisa simpson|now you listen to me i don't like you .
lisa simpson|mom , doesn't any love story have a happy ending ?
lisa simpson|that didn't seem like a happy ending .
lisa simpson|that seems more like a detached tale of modern alienation .
lisa simpson|sorry , mom .
lisa simpson|i've decided to save my love for someone who is guaranteed not to reject me .
lisa simpson|soon , corey , soon .
lisa simpson|ah , your first kiss .
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|remember how you said that going to itchy and scratchy land would be too damned expensive ?
lisa simpson|can we ?
lisa simpson|yayyyyyy !
lisa simpson|yayyy !
lisa simpson|we're going to itchy and scratchy land !
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|bart's dead !

lisa simpson|they have a place called parents island .
lisa simpson|yeah .

lisa simpson|haven't we stood in five different states long enough ?
lisa simpson|cool !

lisa simpson|mom , that's veal .
lisa simpson|awww , look at that cute little baby axe .
lisa simpson|who are all these characters ?
lisa simpson|oh yeah .
lisa simpson|they weren't very funny .
lisa simpson|i wonder if this kind of violence really does desensitize us ?
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|don't do it , bart .
lisa simpson|dad , i think you're wrong about that robot trying to be your friend .
lisa simpson|dad , the flash must have scrambled their circuits .
lisa simpson|just keep taking pictures .
lisa simpson|yeah , best ever .
lisa simpson|but mom , it's exactly what you wanted in a vacation .
lisa simpson|no , mom .
lisa simpson|he's right .
lisa simpson|observe .
lisa simpson|dad , i had to listen to this jerk all morning .
lisa simpson|can we listen to something else ?
lisa simpson|that sounds like sideshow bob !
lisa simpson|dad , i'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't know who sideshow bob is .
lisa simpson|sideshow bob used to be krusty the clown's sidekick .
lisa simpson|when he got out , he married aunt selma and tried to murder her .
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|your mortal enemy is on the radio !
lisa simpson|i meant your other mortal enemy , sideshow bob .
lisa simpson|uncle mayor was just saying that us kids are the most important natural resource we have !
lisa simpson|this time , he's the lesser of two evils .
lisa simpson|i hope that flu doesn't affect his performance out there .
lisa simpson|there's no councilman les wynan .
lisa simpson|i don't think bob won that election legally .
lisa simpson|i thought this was a secret ballot .
lisa simpson|okay , aaron a .
lisa simpson|aaronson voted for ...
lisa simpson|bob .
lisa simpson|aaron l .
lisa simpson|aaronson voted for ...
lisa simpson|bob .
lisa simpson|arthur b .
lisa simpson|ablabab voted for ...
lisa simpson|bob .

lisa simpson|this is hopeless .
lisa simpson|they're gonna demolish our house for sure .
lisa simpson|we're gonna have to move into a motel 6 .
lisa simpson|no , bart , don't you see ?
lisa simpson|dead people can't vote !
lisa simpson|look !
lisa simpson|prudence goodwyfe , died 1641 .
lisa simpson|she voted for bob , too !
lisa simpson|so did buddy holly , richie valens , and the big bopper !
lisa simpson|even the pet cemetery voted for bob !
lisa simpson|look !
lisa simpson|mr and mrs bananas !
lisa simpson|humphrey boagart !
lisa simpson|oh , my poor dead kitty !
lisa simpson|please , not you too !
lisa simpson|all right , bob !
lisa simpson|now it's personal !
lisa simpson|i have a plan .
lisa simpson|i think we can trap him .
lisa simpson|you know , sideshow bob , i believe you when you say you're innocent ...
lisa simpson|barlow !
lisa simpson|you don't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself , do you ?
lisa simpson|you were ronnie to his nancy !
lisa simpson|ringo to his rest of the beatles !
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|we did it !
lisa simpson|the spoon , bart .
lisa simpson|oh no !
lisa simpson|we left grampa back at the gas station .

lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|remember bart , i mean , dances in underwear , we take the white man alive .
lisa simpson|don't be so hard on yourself , bart .
lisa simpson|it's not your fault jessica doesn't like you .
lisa simpson|no , bart .
lisa simpson|i just think you and jessica are too different from each other to get along .
lisa simpson|she's a sweet , kind reverend's daughter and you're the devil's cabana boy .
lisa simpson|i can't believe it , bart .
lisa simpson|i'd always thought jessica was so sweet .
lisa simpson|you gotta give her up .
lisa simpson|bart , it's naive to think you can change a person .
lisa simpson|except maybe that boy who works in the library .
lisa simpson|well read and just a little wild .
lisa simpson|if only someone could tame him .
lisa simpson|bart , be strong .
lisa simpson|you don't need that little hell cat .
lisa simpson|so here's where you're hiding .
lisa simpson|bart , we can't just let her get away with this .
lisa simpson|yeah , well i eat fruit loops for breakfast .
lisa simpson|i know most of you have already judged my brother guilty without any proof .
lisa simpson|but doesn't the bible teach us judge not lest ye be judged , reverend ?
lisa simpson|there is someone among us with a guilty conscience .
lisa simpson|i am talking to the collection money thief .
lisa simpson|only you can come forward and end this injustice .
lisa simpson|oh , what the heck , it was jessica lovejoy .
lisa simpson|if you search her room , i am certain you will find the money .
lisa simpson|that doesn't mean you don't have to do your book report .
lisa simpson|what if the weatherman is wrong ?
lisa simpson|snowball fight !
lisa simpson|i made the snowball from the frost in our freezer .
lisa simpson|grades are all i have .
lisa simpson|what could i be failing ?
lisa simpson|i'm smart and a teacher's pet .
lisa simpson|gym ?
lisa simpson|that's the stupidest thing i ever heard .
lisa simpson|that's not fair ...
lisa simpson|why is bart getting a present and i'm getting chewed out ?
lisa simpson|mom , this is really scary .
lisa simpson|i'm gonna get my first 'f' ever .
lisa simpson|ooooh .
lisa simpson|wow bart , i'm so impressed you were able to give milhouse a concussion .
lisa simpson|cut it out , bart !
lisa simpson|he said it was just a name .
lisa simpson|please , dad , i'll be fine .
lisa simpson|you really think i did okay out there , mom ?
lisa simpson|however , i will sit up front with you if it's a fatherly gesture of love .
lisa simpson|lay off , guys .
lisa simpson|he's with me .
lisa simpson|don't worry , bart , they won't bother you anymore .
lisa simpson|hey milhouse , knock him down if he's in your way !
lisa simpson|jimbo !

lisa simpson|marge , bart , lisa , and maggie .
lisa simpson|dad , this doesn't have your name on it .
lisa simpson|sorry , grampa .
lisa simpson|it's just that , for a second , it looked like dad had melted .
lisa simpson|he robbed the school of music !
lisa simpson|everyone in springfield had a reason to shoot mr burns .
lisa simpson|even us .
lisa simpson|bart , he broke your dog's legs .
lisa simpson|grampa , he destroyed your home .
lisa simpson|and dad , well , you kind of went berserk when he couldn't remember your name .

lisa simpson|and i've got an inquisitive temperament !
lisa simpson|maybe i could help solve this !
lisa simpson|mr burns is the richest man in town .
lisa simpson|maybe it was about money .
lisa simpson|hey !
lisa simpson|i said that .
lisa simpson|look .
lisa simpson|mr burns hurt all these people financially nightclub owner moe szyslak .
lisa simpson|his bar was closed because of burns' negligence ;
lisa simpson|liquor connoisseur barney gumble .

lisa simpson|his school lost millions when burns pirated its oil well ;
lisa simpson|and groundstender groundskeeper willie .

lisa simpson|except you , since you're a bouvier .
lisa simpson|okay , mom .
lisa simpson|anyway , my point is , the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems .
lisa simpson|like those fingerprints .
lisa simpson|they could've gotten on the gun some other way .
lisa simpson|are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice cream cones ?
lisa simpson|and we don't even know whose gun that was .
lisa simpson|maybe somebody planted it there to frame dad .
lisa simpson|the scene of the crime !
lisa simpson|there must be something here that can clear dad .
lisa simpson|that's it !
lisa simpson|oh , mr pigeon , i'd kiss you if you weren't swimming with disease .

lisa simpson|n .

lisa simpson|well , when was the last time dad gave her that kind of attention ?
lisa simpson|i thought i could ride this thing out , but everything's just too weird here .
lisa simpson|and they read newsweek instead of nothing .
lisa simpson|yeah .
lisa simpson|the sun is still out .
lisa simpson|you know , maggie hasn't been a simpson as long as us .

lisa simpson|your soul is the most valuable part of you !
lisa simpson|bart , your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever .
lisa simpson|for five dollars , milhouse could own you for a zillion years .
lisa simpson|hmmm ...
lisa simpson|pablo neruda said laughter is the language of the soul .
lisa simpson|i think we should do a test .
lisa simpson|well ?
lisa simpson|that's creepy , bart .
lisa simpson|i think you really did lose your soul .
lisa simpson|how're the southwestern pizza fingers ?

lisa simpson|wow !
lisa simpson|the secret confessions of jebediah springfield ?
lisa simpson|know ye who read this there is more to my life than history records .
lisa simpson|ha ha ha ha ha .
lisa simpson|oh my god !
lisa simpson|our town hero is a fraud !
lisa simpson|oh , it's just the excitement of studying jebediah .
lisa simpson|just when i was getting over my chester a .
lisa simpson|arthritis .
lisa simpson|uh , no .
lisa simpson|look .
lisa simpson|jebediah was really a vicious pirate named hans sprüngfeld .
lisa simpson|his tongue was bitten off by a turk in a grog house fight !
lisa simpson|he had a prosthetic tongue made out of silver .
lisa simpson|he was one of the evillest men of the 1780's .
lisa simpson|he even tried to kill george washington !
lisa simpson|the next time hans sprüngfeld was seen , he had changed his name to jebediah springfield .
lisa simpson|you do ?
lisa simpson|aw , thanks , dad .
lisa simpson|but it's all true !
lisa simpson|miss hoover thought i made the whole thing up .
lisa simpson|she called me a p .
lisa simpson|c .
lisa simpson|thug .
lisa simpson|that won't help , dad .
lisa simpson|no one's ever going to believe me .
lisa simpson|we could ?
lisa simpson|no baseball bat .
lisa simpson|hi , mr hurlbut .
lisa simpson|that's jebediah's secret confession .
lisa simpson|it proves he was a fraud .
lisa simpson|but it explains why there's no record of jebediah before 1795 !
lisa simpson|he was hans sprüngfeld until then !
lisa simpson|i'm not going to give up .
lisa simpson|i refuse to believe that everyone refuses to believe the truth .
lisa simpson|you don't have to help me with this , dad .
lisa simpson|hi , apu .
lisa simpson|can i put this poster in your window ?
lisa simpson|he wouldn't let me put it up .
lisa simpson|jebediah springfield was nothing more than an evil , bloodthirsty pirate who hated this town !
lisa simpson|that's a myth that got mixed up with the truth .
lisa simpson|i hope you know you're sponsoring a celebration for a murderous pirate !
lisa simpson|there is one way get the silver tongue .
lisa simpson|if jebediah's who i say he is , then it should still be in his grave .
lisa simpson|yes .
lisa simpson|don't forget to look in his shoes .

lisa simpson|the missing piece of the puzzle ...
lisa simpson|i've got it !
lisa simpson|that's because you stole it !
lisa simpson|but when you found the truth , you couldn't take it !
lisa simpson|you couldn't stand that you'd devoted your life to a fraud !
lisa simpson|so you covered it up !
lisa simpson|didn't you ?
lisa simpson|didn't you ?
lisa simpson|stop it !
lisa simpson|where's the silver tongue ?
lisa simpson|you did .
lisa simpson|until i realized that jebediah's confession was saying more than he meant it to .
lisa simpson|how else could he have gotten this ?
lisa simpson|exactly .
lisa simpson|people of springfield , i , uh , i don't know quite how to say this ...
lisa simpson|i did a lot of research on jebediah springfield and ...
lisa simpson|jebediah springfield was ...
lisa simpson|jebediah was ...
lisa simpson|great .
lisa simpson|because the myth of jebediah has value , too .

lisa simpson|i was laughing at something outside .
lisa simpson|oh , how does bart do this every week ?
lisa simpson|it's your fault !
lisa simpson|i accidentally laughed at your immature prank .
lisa simpson|thanks , but i prefer the honest way .
lisa simpson|wow , that was a good idea .
lisa simpson|and i can't believe it came from nelson .
lisa simpson|milhouse , i've never told anyone this kind of thing before ...
lisa simpson|but i've never felt this way before .
lisa simpson|i think i have a crush ...
lisa simpson|on nelson muntz .
lisa simpson|but i bet underneath , he's a sweet , sensitive person like you .
lisa simpson|i guess you could say i want to bring out the milhouse in nelson .
lisa simpson|i like you , too , milhouse , but not in that way .
lisa simpson|you're more like a big sister .
lisa simpson|would you do me a favor ?
lisa simpson|when you get back to class , just give him this note .
lisa simpson|please ?
lisa simpson|milhouse , i'm so sorry ...
lisa simpson|nelson !
lisa simpson|um ...
lisa simpson|that note milhouse gave you ...
lisa simpson|it wasn't from him .
lisa simpson|it was from ...
lisa simpson|me .
lisa simpson|i don't know why i like you .
lisa simpson|i just do .
lisa simpson|so ...
lisa simpson|what do you think ?
lisa simpson|well ...
lisa simpson|would you like to come over to my house after school ?
lisa simpson|oh , you've got to see this , it's so cute what she does .

lisa simpson|go on , be the baby .
lisa simpson|c'mon !
lisa simpson|snowball !
lisa simpson|i don't understand .
lisa simpson|it's okay , i invited him over .
lisa simpson|nelson's my new ...
lisa simpson|friend .
lisa simpson|please don't ruin this for me , bart .
lisa simpson|i think he's starting to like me !
lisa simpson|oh , please .
lisa simpson|milhouse likes vaseline on toast .
lisa simpson|nuke the whales ?
lisa simpson|you don't really believe that , do you ?
lisa simpson|touché .
lisa simpson|you play the guitar ?
lisa simpson|would you ...
lisa simpson|play a song for me ?
lisa simpson|i wish i could laugh at the idea of a teacher being decapitated .
lisa simpson|hardly .
lisa simpson|how am i supposed to get home ?
lisa simpson|i feel so stupid , mom .
lisa simpson|nelson's not right for me at all .
lisa simpson|and i don't think he ever will be .
lisa simpson|what ?
lisa simpson|mom ...
lisa simpson|oh , i know .
lisa simpson|i wonder if i could change nelson ...
lisa simpson|very sharp !
lisa simpson|i know it's a change , but it really highlights your sweet and sensitive side .
lisa simpson|isn't it nice up here ?
lisa simpson|what are you thinking , nelson ?
lisa simpson|about anything .
lisa simpson|what do you feel ?
lisa simpson|what's inside you right now ?
lisa simpson|come on , nelson !
lisa simpson|you must think and feel things .
lisa simpson|see , you do have a tender side .
lisa simpson|you just needed someone to bring it out .
lisa simpson|listen , you thugs , stop making fun of him or you'll be sorry !
lisa simpson|he's not like you anymore !
lisa simpson|he's changed !
lisa simpson|and he doesn't want to hang around with a buncha crumbbums !
lisa simpson|you got rid of them !
lisa simpson|and you did it like a gentleman , without any violence .
lisa simpson|that's so unfair !
lisa simpson|meet me at the back door !
lisa simpson|i think they're giving up .
lisa simpson|i thought you weren't there .
lisa simpson|you lied to me .
lisa simpson|there , you did it again !
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|you don't understand , nelson .
lisa simpson|a kiss doesn't mean anything if it's dishonest .
lisa simpson|i was foolish to think i'd actually changed you .
lisa simpson|maybe i was seeing things in you that weren't really there .
lisa simpson|then why did you want to be with me ?
lisa simpson|well , i guess this is it ...
lisa simpson|let's just call it smell ya later .
lisa simpson|don't worry .
lisa simpson|nelson and i don't like each other anymore .
lisa simpson|well , i'm really not thinking about that now .

lisa simpson|adding a new character is often a desperate attempt to boost low ratings .
lisa simpson|you should try out , dad .
lisa simpson|you have a funny voice .
lisa simpson|no , it's not your fault , dad .
lisa simpson|you did fine .
lisa simpson|it's just that poochie was a soulless byproduct of committee thinking .

lisa simpson|i never realized how many celebrities humiliated themselves right in our own backyard !
lisa simpson|but , dad , it's barbaric !

lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|they were just going to find a deer and make bart shoot it .
lisa simpson|but if there're no deer out there , then what are they hunting ?
lisa simpson|where are the dice ?
lisa simpson|this is about as tolerant as dad gets , so you should be flattered .
lisa simpson|he thinks you're gay .
lisa simpson|and vice versa .
lisa simpson|hey , you said we were going to dairy queen .
lisa simpson|i know it's hard to accept , bart , but face it sideshow bob has changed .
lisa simpson|bob's trailer at the construction site ?

lisa simpson|if i didn't know better , i'd swear bob was building a dam .
lisa simpson|bart , there must be millions of dollars there !

lisa simpson|then you must have had your eyes closed when you embezzled it .

lisa simpson|it's hopeless .
lisa simpson|utterly , utterly hopeless .

lisa simpson|um , do you know what you're doing ?
lisa simpson|bob , look !
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|no , chief , bob's innocent !
lisa simpson|it's the truth !

lisa simpson|that's a trust , janey .
lisa simpson|a sacred trust .
lisa simpson|why hasn't anyone called ?
lisa simpson|but ...

lisa simpson|how did the badger do that without ripping your shirt ?
lisa simpson|it's a movie , dad .

lisa simpson|okay , you're ready to go .
lisa simpson|i've written down the basic commands so that anyone can understand them .
lisa simpson|well ...
lisa simpson|a web page is supposed to be a personal thing .
lisa simpson|you've just stolen copyrighted material from everyone else .
lisa simpson|they could sue you for that .
lisa simpson|mom wants you to come to bed .
lisa simpson|you have to offer people something a joke , an opinion , an idea ...
lisa simpson|you can't post that on the internet .
lisa simpson|you don't even know if it's true .
lisa simpson|maybe you should quit while you're ahead .
lisa simpson|well , you can't post news if you don't have any .
lisa simpson|at least take off your pulitzer prize when you say that .
lisa simpson|oh , dad ...

lisa simpson|but , there's a simple and highly satisfying explanation .
lisa simpson|you see ...
lisa simpson|the cirque de purée .
lisa simpson|we've had tickets since septembre .
lisa simpson|as french canadians , they don't believe in refunds , or exploiting animals for entertainment .

lisa simpson|i'd love to go to the library with you .

lisa simpson|dad , as intelligence goes up , happiness often goes down .
lisa simpson|in fact , i made a graph .
lisa simpson|i make a lot of graphs .

lisa simpson|you remember the story of oedipus , don't you ?
lisa simpson|oedipus killed his father and married his mother .
lisa simpson|i'm just saying you feel threatened by bart , but it's all in your head .
lisa simpson|dad , i think you're overreacting .

lisa simpson|but it's not too late .
lisa simpson|you can still fly to stockholm .

lisa simpson|krusty , your dad's a rabbi how could you not have had a bar mitzvah ?
lisa simpson|krusty , you can still have your bar mitzvah as an adult .

lisa simpson|we're the band .
lisa simpson|and we're on !
lisa simpson|i think we're heading for disaster / and most of you will not be saved ...
lisa simpson|unless the captain is attentive / we'll all be crushed by a huge wave ...
lisa simpson|this hatchway is jammed !
lisa simpson|okay , the engine room is just through this flooded area .
lisa simpson|i can't wait to see this reimagining of itchy and scratchy ...

lisa simpson|jake .
lisa simpson|uh ...

lisa simpson|man ...
lisa simpson|boyman .
lisa simpson|jake boyman .

lisa simpson|what the hell are you talking about ?
lisa simpson|i have to go .
lisa simpson|nelson , you're not really angry at me .
lisa simpson|you're full of rage 'cause your father abandoned you .
lisa simpson|and because you're poor , so you don't feel like you're good enough .
lisa simpson|you just want somebody to say i love you .
lisa simpson|i love you .

lisa simpson|that's a lie !
lisa simpson|i always thought that boys had it easier .
lisa simpson|but now i see their world is more cruel and sadistic than i ever imagined .
lisa simpson|i guess the real reason we don't see many women in math and science is ...
lisa simpson|now enjoy your stupid flautist .
lisa simpson|dad , all you had to do was paint one number .
lisa simpson|now no one's gonna be able to find our house .
lisa simpson|mom , what are you doing ?
lisa simpson|this is a total stranger who cleans houses for a living .
lisa simpson|who cares what she thinks ?
lisa simpson|well , talk to me in a week .
lisa simpson|the sound of the baby must have triggered a primal mnemonic response in mom's brain .
lisa simpson|this is horrible .
lisa simpson|dad , we don't want you to leave !
lisa simpson|well , now it's time for my summer activity .
lisa simpson|you promised we could go to a museum .
lisa simpson|i'm so glad you picked the museum of natural history , mom .
lisa simpson|bart , it's still history .
lisa simpson|creationism ?
lisa simpson|but that's not science .
lisa simpson|how can you teach the book of genesis as a scientific theory ?
lisa simpson|this is slander !
lisa simpson|darwin was one of the greatest minds of all time !
lisa simpson|evolution is widely acknowledged as scientific fact .
lisa simpson|it's even accepted by prominent conservatives , like george will and the late pope john paul !
lisa simpson|they're making us learn creation theory in school .
lisa simpson|today we had a test , and every answer was god did it .
lisa simpson|but they're incompatible !
lisa simpson|mom , you really have to choose here , between science and belief .
lisa simpson|dad , you're not really reconsidering evolution , are you ?
lisa simpson|i have an issue i'd like to raise !
lisa simpson|last week , the unscientific theory of creationism was introduced alongside evolution in springfield public schools .
lisa simpson|evolution and creationism cannot coexist , people .
lisa simpson|it is time to go back to teaching one single truth !
lisa simpson|i'm so glad you could all come .
lisa simpson|i'll be reading to you from the origin of species by charles darwin .
lisa simpson|there are so many worse crimes .
lisa simpson|why are you persecuting me ?
lisa simpson|i'm sorry , mom .
lisa simpson|i should have just gone with the flow like you said .
lisa simpson|thanks , mom .
lisa simpson|mr flanders , wait !
lisa simpson|it's amazing they've gotten five hundred and twelve shows out of this premise .
lisa simpson|but , grampa , in nineteen fortytwo , they only played women's baseball here .
lisa simpson|shake it off , buck !
lisa simpson|i concur !
lisa simpson|isn't it weird that our parents are giving marital advice ?
lisa simpson|they're always fighting if you listen closely , you can hear them arguing right now .
lisa simpson|otto , help me !
lisa simpson|i'm not afraid of you .
lisa simpson|i understand .
lisa simpson|i'm not like my dad either .
lisa simpson|there's a triple a battery in my macaroni and cheese !
lisa simpson|i can't eat this .
lisa simpson|well , you're not gonna find any here .
lisa simpson|it's delicious !
lisa simpson|no , it's great !
lisa simpson|except for the bee !
lisa simpson|you could make a great chef someday .
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|fat tony , it's not important what other people think of you .
lisa simpson|what matters is how you feel , inside !
lisa simpson|where did you get that ?
lisa simpson|it's so great that michael's doing what he loves .
lisa simpson|why didn't you tell him it was an accident ?
lisa simpson|it was an accident , right ?
lisa simpson|michael ?
lisa simpson|michael ?
lisa simpson|you guys need a break .
lisa simpson|why don't i take bart with me to the children's bebop brunch at jazzy goodtime's ?
lisa simpson|hey bart , you wanna jam with me ?
lisa simpson|not bad for a newbie , bart !
lisa simpson|you just may be the secondbest player up here .
lisa simpson|in case you're wondering who the best one is , it's me .
lisa simpson|yes , i am .
lisa simpson|pleased to meet you .
lisa simpson|yes ...
lisa simpson|yes ?
lisa simpson|yes !
lisa simpson|oh , i can't believe ...
lisa simpson|'cause i've wanted to jam with jazz musicians all my life !
lisa simpson|how would bart like it if i just hopped on his skateboard and instantly became great ?
lisa simpson|mildmildmildmildmild !
lisa simpson|it's jazz !
lisa simpson|jazz !
lisa simpson|you don't even know the name of the thing you are stealing from me !
lisa simpson|i always wanted a jazz nickname !
lisa simpson|that is the most unfair ...
lisa simpson|bart , does that even mean anything ?
lisa simpson|mom , i'm gonna lose it !
lisa simpson|bart's on the cover of both local jazz magazines blowin' and the sugar sheet .
lisa simpson|here's the only thing i've been on the cover of .
lisa simpson|that might work .
lisa simpson|aww , they're all so cute .
lisa simpson|well , i kind of like this guy ...
lisa simpson|ooh , but this one is precious !
lisa simpson|okay , this little guy's coming home with me !
lisa simpson|who's gonna get neutered tomorrow ?
lisa simpson|you are !
lisa simpson|oh , yes you are .
lisa simpson|i did ?
lisa simpson|how ?
lisa simpson|i never wanted that to happen !
lisa simpson|i won't get tired of him !
lisa simpson|i'll take him too !
lisa simpson|i'll take him too .

lisa simpson|no , buttercup !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|i feel so terrible .
lisa simpson|i just wanted to save those animals while bart became a drummer ...
lisa simpson|but i never thought the two stories would intersect .
lisa simpson|sure .
lisa simpson|i guess that's it .
lisa simpson|these animals are all gonna die .
lisa simpson|do you have an idea ?
lisa simpson|oh , bart , thank you so , so much !
lisa simpson|this place is looking a little run down .
lisa simpson|now it's a collection of candle kiosks and persian cd stores .
lisa simpson|i never wanna go back to that mall .
lisa simpson|there were eels in the photo booth !
lisa simpson|wow mom , you made all this ?
lisa simpson|this is a valuable skill .
lisa simpson|people might even pay you to build things for them .
lisa simpson|bart , skinner's gonna be really mad at you .
lisa simpson|whatever , i've got some paper to mâché .
lisa simpson|i'd like a daddy who lived in the real world .
lisa simpson|dad , put aside your selfish male ego and tell the truth !
lisa simpson|dad , no !
lisa simpson|it could teach us the secret of interstellar travel !
lisa simpson|bart , did your mystical jewish monster beat up those bullies ?
lisa simpson|hmm , well i think your golem doesn't like hurting people .
lisa simpson|and i'll prove it .
lisa simpson|speak .
lisa simpson|do you feel bad about what you did ?
lisa simpson|he sure is neurotic for a monster .
lisa simpson|just write a scroll , asking him to stop .

lisa simpson|among the many things we learned in vietnam is that a wellmotivated ...

lisa simpson|what a deep , tormented soul ...
lisa simpson|moe !
lisa simpson|you have a worldview both bleak and beautiful !
lisa simpson|i wanna write a report about you !
lisa simpson|because i suspect deep within you is an artist's soul .
lisa simpson|moe , these fragments are fascinating .
lisa simpson|i was in the christmas pageant once .
lisa simpson|mom showed up with a new boyfriend .
lisa simpson|he called me steve .
lisa simpson|what you've got here is poetry !

homer simpson|don't mind me boys , just scrubbing my undies .
homer simpson|keep up the roughhousing , son .
homer simpson|without a strong male presence in the house , you could turn sissy overnight .
homer simpson|oh , these stubborn grass stains .
homer simpson|oh , good , reverend lovejoy will make marge take me back .
homer simpson|he has to push the sanctity of marriage or his god will punish him .

homer simpson|it's actually a very interesting story .
homer simpson|it all began about two years ago , before maggie was even born .
homer simpson|listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any tv show .
homer simpson|it was a tumultuous time for our nation .
homer simpson|the clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live .

homer simpson|don't worry , marge .
homer simpson|i've come up with a perfectly balanced budget .

homer simpson|we began with dinner and dancing ...
homer simpson|followed by a stroll on the beach ...
homer simpson|marge ...
homer simpson|i've got sand in my underpants .
homer simpson|i love you , marge .
homer simpson|everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced .
homer simpson|i hope things stay exactly like this forever .
homer simpson|it's okay , marge .
homer simpson|they pave the way for this kind of filth in school .
homer simpson|actually , your mother hadn't told me yet .
homer simpson|at that time , i had no idea maggie even existed .
homer simpson|hi maggie .
homer simpson|marge , you tie up the bathroom every morning .
homer simpson|i've got to wash my hair .
homer simpson|the next few weeks at my dream job were like a wonderful waking coma .
homer simpson|mmm ...
homer simpson|bowling fresh .
homer simpson|mmm ...
homer simpson|urinal fresh .

homer simpson|i was in heaven .
homer simpson|if horse racing is the sport of kings , then surely bowling ...

homer simpson|can't talk , praying .
homer simpson|dear lord , the gods have been good to me and i am thankful .
homer simpson|hey , wait a minute .

homer simpson|i needed more money to support my growing family .
homer simpson|and there was only one place in town that a man like me could make it .
homer simpson|actually , i quit and i came to get my job back .
homer simpson|seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it .
homer simpson|thanks for giving me my old job back .
homer simpson|i've never been so miserable in all my life .
homer simpson|but i can't take it out on marge and the kids .
homer simpson|i've got to carry the burden all by myself .

homer simpson|hmm , that's queer .
homer simpson|what ?
homer simpson|the food !
homer simpson|why did this happen ?
homer simpson|whyyyyyy ?
homer simpson|okay .
homer simpson|it was just the shock of seeing all that food on the floor .
homer simpson|plus i'd just fallen on my back , which hurt more than i let on .
homer simpson|eh , i never thought i'd live this long .
homer simpson|i'll get us out of this , honey .
homer simpson|it's just gonna take a whole lot of floorin' .
homer simpson|hmmm ...
homer simpson|when you think about it , mud is nothing but wet dirt .
homer simpson|shhh .
homer simpson|we're trespassing .
homer simpson|and some of these farmers have pitchforks .
homer simpson|that was close !
homer simpson|at your service , milady .
homer simpson|cara mia ...
homer simpson|bart , i told you not to leave that tv on .
homer simpson|no , no , honey .
homer simpson|maybe this will help .

homer simpson|marge and i are spending the weekend at a bed and breakfast .
homer simpson|nah , it'd just be awkward ...
homer simpson|what with the sex and all .
homer simpson|now they did say bed and breakfast , right ?
homer simpson|if there's anything more exquisite than queen anne's lace , i haven't found it .
homer simpson|are you ready to rock ?
homer simpson|'cause heeere we go !
homer simpson|um , no time like the present .
homer simpson|well , yeah , kinda ...
homer simpson|did that butter churn just move ?
homer simpson|'cause if it did ...

homer simpson|oh , we're surrounded , marge .
homer simpson|maybe we should give ourselves up .
homer simpson|yeah , the british tabloids will have a field day .
homer simpson|there's only one thing left to do .
homer simpson|grab onto the handles , marge .
homer simpson|okay , i think i've figured this thing out .
homer simpson|these have pleats ...
homer simpson|i'm okay , honey .
homer simpson|now listen very carefully .
homer simpson|i want you to pull on the thing that's near the other thing .
homer simpson|no , that was not the thing .
homer simpson|thank you ...
homer simpson|marge , uh , can we not land here ?
homer simpson|honey ?
homer simpson|baby doll ...
homer simpson|why don't you take a picture ?
homer simpson|it lasts longer .
homer simpson|dads especially !
homer simpson|scary ways .
homer simpson|but we never intended it to end like that .
homer simpson|with thousands of people staring at our naked bodies .
homer simpson|who's in the mood for miniature golf ?
homer simpson|can't you just write on your arm like i do ?
homer simpson|yo , apu , gimme the usual .
homer simpson|hey , this hot dog tastes different .
homer simpson|uh , yeah , but without the grease all you can taste is the hog anus .
homer simpson|people buy grease ?
homer simpson|used grease is worth money ?
homer simpson|then my arteries are clogged with yellow gold .
homer simpson|i'm rich , apu !
homer simpson|rich , i !
homer simpson|money in the bank .
homer simpson|okay , this bacon's done .
homer simpson|and now for the profit taking .
homer simpson|looks like he's about ready for another squeezin' .
homer simpson|marge , if you don't mind , i'm a little busy right now achieving financial independence .
homer simpson|no , through savings and wise investments .
homer simpson|of course with grease !
homer simpson|where do you think you're goin' ?
homer simpson|not for you it isn't .
homer simpson|you're in the grease business now .
homer simpson|woo hoo !
homer simpson|yeah , but your mom paid for that .
homer simpson|and i get my money from grease .
homer simpson|what's the problem ?
homer simpson|wow , look at that load of grease .
homer simpson|boy , if we're ever gonna earn paper money , we have to expand our operation .
homer simpson|oh , you'll miss plenty .
homer simpson|i have a feeling this business is going to consume our whole lives .
homer simpson|lisa , i can't imagine anyone being more likable than you .
homer simpson|but apparently this new girl is .
homer simpson|so my advice would be to start copying her in every way .
homer simpson|uhuh , think .
homer simpson|is that what alex would say ?
homer simpson|oh i'll say .
homer simpson|look at that redheaded kid .
homer simpson|there must be twenty dollars' worth of grease on his forehead alone .
homer simpson|all right .
homer simpson|we'll try it your way .
homer simpson|my god , you're greasy .
homer simpson|hey , what the ...
homer simpson|hey , hey , you're taking our grease !
homer simpson|hey , that's my shovel .
homer simpson|oh , i can't believe those goons muscled me out of my grease business .
homer simpson|i've been muscled out of everything i've ever done , including my muscleforhire business .
homer simpson|oh , what's the point ?
homer simpson|emus ?
homer simpson|really ?
homer simpson|oh , that's pretty crazy ...

homer simpson|i'm halfway to my grave , and i haven't accomplished anything .

homer simpson|i've wasted half my life , marge .

homer simpson|thirtyeight years and that's all i have to show for it .
homer simpson|cold .
homer simpson|oh .
homer simpson|i see you're having a party .
homer simpson|i'll come back later .
homer simpson|oh , all right .
homer simpson|maybe i can pinpoint where my life went wrong .
homer simpson|all we did was grow some space tomatoes and sabotage mir .
homer simpson|no .
homer simpson|hike .
homer simpson|oh , i shoulda punted .
homer simpson|turn it off !
homer simpson|turn it off !
homer simpson|stupid movies .
homer simpson|who invented these dumb things anyway ?
homer simpson|was it you , bart ?
homer simpson|no one man can do all that .
homer simpson|you're a liar , honey .
homer simpson|a dirty , rotten liar .
homer simpson|really ?
homer simpson|a restaurant ?
homer simpson|well , now i don't know what to think .
homer simpson|cut it out , boy !
homer simpson|reading about this edison character .
homer simpson|they won't let me in the big people library downtown .
homer simpson|there was some unpleasantness .
homer simpson|i can never go back .
homer simpson|ooh , look at all the inventions edison came up with .
homer simpson|the stock ticker , the storage battery , even wax paper .
homer simpson|and look at him dance .
homer simpson|de de de de de .
homer simpson|and these hardy boys books are great , too .
homer simpson|this one is about smugglers .
homer simpson|no , not this one .
homer simpson|the smugglers of pirate cove .
homer simpson|it's about pirates .
homer simpson|i think it's pretty obvious that i am .
homer simpson|go school !
homer simpson|not the way i quit .
homer simpson|oohwho .
homer simpson|yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , great story , lenny .
homer simpson|but here's one that's even more spellbinding .
homer simpson|once upon a time there was a man named thomas edison .
homer simpson|and he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph ...
homer simpson|and he never , ever , ever wore pajamas .
homer simpson|and ...
homer simpson|well , i remember where edison worked .
homer simpson|it was menlo park .
homer simpson|that's where he came up with the tasimeter , the ore separator and ...
homer simpson|that's boring .
homer simpson|you're boring everybody .
homer simpson|quit boring everyone !
homer simpson|and then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead .
homer simpson|some kind of scary telephone i guess .
homer simpson|or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell .
homer simpson|ohh , that's where you're wrong , marge .
homer simpson|he was a shameless selfpromoter .
homer simpson|marge , that's it !
homer simpson|that's why i haven't done anything with my life !
homer simpson|i need to be more like thomas edison !
homer simpson|and i'm starting right now .
homer simpson|no more lousy pajamas !
homer simpson|from this day forward , i am an inventor !
homer simpson|well , i quit my job just like you said to .
homer simpson|yes , you did .
homer simpson|i remember your exact words .
homer simpson|you said i should quit my job and become an inventor or you'd torch the house .
homer simpson|at my age edison had already invented 203 things .
homer simpson|ohh , i've got a lot of work to do to catch up to him .
homer simpson|let's see now ...
homer simpson|inventions ...
homer simpson|inventions ...
homer simpson|what ?
homer simpson|eh .
homer simpson|eh .
homer simpson|let me handle the creative end of this , marge .
homer simpson|you don't understand how the creative mind works like i do .
homer simpson|you look at this table and what do you see ?
homer simpson|just a table .
homer simpson|my files !
homer simpson|uh , this isn't working .
homer simpson|i've got to try a different approach .
homer simpson|yes .
homer simpson|thomas edison smoked several cigars a day .
homer simpson|shutup .
homer simpson|as long as you're here annoying me , let's have a brainstorming session .
homer simpson|okay .
homer simpson|uhhuh .
homer simpson|a wait a minute !
homer simpson|these aren't exciting new products !
homer simpson|you're not even trying .
homer simpson|okay , that's it .
homer simpson|both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves .
homer simpson|i don't see why not .
homer simpson|they're my kids .
homer simpson|i own 'em .
homer simpson|okay , we own 'em .
homer simpson|ohhh , it's no use .
homer simpson|i can't work like this , cut off from the scientific community .
homer simpson|you stay here and guard the sandwich .
homer simpson|look , i just want to know how to invent things .
homer simpson|tell me .
homer simpson|you mean like an electric blanketmobile ?
homer simpson|hamburger earmuffs !
homer simpson|thanks , sucker !
homer simpson|okay , i have here the four greatest inventions in the history of mankind .
homer simpson|first , my allpurpose electric hammer .
homer simpson|for all your pounding needs .
homer simpson|ow !
homer simpson|probably needs to be more powerful .
homer simpson|now , here's my everything's okay alarm .
homer simpson|this will sound every three seconds unless something isn't okay .
homer simpson|it can't be turned off .
homer simpson|but it does break easily .
homer simpson|now this next one's for the ladies .
homer simpson|that's why i invented this revolutionary makeup gun .
homer simpson|it's for the woman who only has fourfifths of a second to get ready .
homer simpson|close your eyes , marge .
homer simpson|and now you're ready for a night on the town .
homer simpson|eh .
homer simpson|oh .
homer simpson|okay , this time try to keep your nostrils closed .
homer simpson|oh , look what you did .
homer simpson|now i have to get my cold cream gun .
homer simpson|women will like what i tell them to like .
homer simpson|now here's something for everyone .
homer simpson|it was the hardest thing in the world to do .
homer simpson|sure !
homer simpson|believe me , every man in america will want to have one .
homer simpson|yes ?
homer simpson|yes ?
homer simpson|yes ?
homer simpson|yes ?
homer simpson|what ?
homer simpson|but this is the best i could do .
homer simpson|i guess i'm no better at being thomas edison than i was at being homer simpson .
homer simpson|oh , that .
homer simpson|really ?
homer simpson|you think it's a good idea ?
homer simpson|i did it !
homer simpson|i'm gonna be rich !
homer simpson|look , mr edison , i did it .
homer simpson|i'm an inventor !
homer simpson|and i owe it all to you .
homer simpson|see ?
homer simpson|kinda like the ones on the back of your ...
homer simpson|awdammit !
homer simpson|i thought i had a great idea , but i must've seen it on this poster .
homer simpson|it's not ?
homer simpson|maybe he never told anyone about it .
homer simpson|that chair might be the only one he made .
homer simpson|so , we've got to go to the edison museum and smash it !
homer simpson|then i'll be an inventor !
homer simpson|aw , to hell with him !
homer simpson|takingbartacrossstatelinesbacksoon .
homer simpson|i borrowed your wallet !
homer simpson|oh , son , you're young and headstrong , just like thomas edison , jr .
homer simpson|oh , and later , he raised turkeys .
homer simpson|that was on his turkey farm .
homer simpson|now let's take care of business .
homer simpson|outta the way .
homer simpson|this is one invention you're not getting credit for , you inspiration hog !
homer simpson|invent your way out of this , edison .
homer simpson|look , son .
homer simpson|edison was just like me .
homer simpson|no !
homer simpson|we both lived in another man's shadow .
homer simpson|this oldtimey nerd and i have suffered the same frustration and heartache .
homer simpson|we're not rivals .
homer simpson|we're just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high .
homer simpson|i can't destroy your work , my friend .
homer simpson|no , but we'll stop off at the da vinci museum on the way home ...
homer simpson|oh .
homer simpson|well then , we'll take it out on eli whitney .
homer simpson|yay !
homer simpson|/ all right !
homer simpson|/ woohoo !
homer simpson|that's my tommy .
