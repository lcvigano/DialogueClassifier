lisa simpson|again with the blonde !
lisa simpson|sally circle was eating donuts and ovaltine when her father came in with terrible news .
lisa simpson|everyone was mean to sally .
lisa simpson|she was too wellrounded .
lisa simpson|she felt cornered .
lisa simpson|they wouldn't let her play foursquare or invite her to the box social .
lisa simpson|the end .
lisa simpson|that's a rather unambitious book .

lisa simpson|dye !
lisa simpson|dye !

lisa simpson|it's better to just fit in with the crowd .
lisa simpson|oh , i can't go on !

lisa simpson|well guess what , i am not a brunette !
lisa simpson|i'm a blonde !
lisa simpson|we must rid ourselves of these outdated clichés .
lisa simpson|not all blondes are dumb !
lisa simpson|not all fat people are jolly .
lisa simpson|and not all old people are bad drivers !
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|that's a dangerous attitude for you to take towards your wife .
lisa simpson|when there's cruelty involved , bart sure knows his history .
lisa simpson|dad , i'm gonna need some help getting this off .
lisa simpson|grandma ?
lisa simpson|how shortened ?
lisa simpson|another springfield family moves to detroit to find a better life .

lisa simpson|you have a nice firm handshake ...
lisa simpson|and when you wag your tail , it really lights up a room .
lisa simpson|now , let's scoot together .
lisa simpson|mr cowell , would you like some band candy ?
lisa simpson|we're watching the nobel prize announcements , live from stockholm !

lisa simpson|isn't this exciting ?
lisa simpson|why aren't i going to oslo ?
lisa simpson|the nobel prizes are my freakin' thing !
lisa simpson|but no bart gets everything because he's the oldest and he's a boy .
lisa simpson|and maggie gets what's ever left over because she's the youngest and she's a baby .

lisa simpson|ew , no thanks .

lisa simpson|hey , there have been plenty of female managers in baseball !
lisa simpson|really ?
lisa simpson|they sound like ...
lisa simpson|i mean ...

lisa simpson|i was hoping you and your friends could tell me something about baseball strategy .
lisa simpson|does anyone here actually know anything about baseball ?
lisa simpson|wow , i'm surprised you guys know so much about a sport .
lisa simpson|huh ?
lisa simpson|thanks , guys .
lisa simpson|everyone shift towards right !
lisa simpson|don't swing at anything !

lisa simpson|i don't know ...
lisa simpson|yes .
lisa simpson|so because of your onbase percentage , nelson , you're the new leadoff hitter .
lisa simpson|questions ?

lisa simpson|kidding !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|no , don't steal !
lisa simpson|okay , okay , he's stolen third .
lisa simpson|but surely that's the limit of his cockiness ...
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|the computer says it's statistically impossible !
lisa simpson|stealing home .
lisa simpson|it's so impossible .
lisa simpson|it's against every sensible instinct ...
lisa simpson|it's , it's ...
lisa simpson|it's the most exciting play in baseball !
lisa simpson|go , bart !
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|but you did do something .
lisa simpson|you made me love baseball .
lisa simpson|can you put a number on it ?
lisa simpson|awww ...
lisa simpson|you're gonna have to deal with more nonsense like that .
lisa simpson|it's something you've never seen they're smitten .
lisa simpson|well , he is cute .
lisa simpson|but i'm sure a boy like him would never say hello to me .
lisa simpson|i love your pallor .
lisa simpson|how'd you do that ?
lisa simpson|they're just dots in circles .
lisa simpson|you're a vampire !
lisa simpson|i should be scared , but i'm not .
lisa simpson|edmund's almost here , so please nobody be themselves !
lisa simpson|i know just how you feel !
lisa simpson|bite me now , edmund and we'll both be vampires !
lisa simpson|sir , i'm not trying to take your son away from you .

lisa simpson|whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa !
lisa simpson|i can't spend eternity using kid scissors .
lisa simpson|they barely cut anything !
lisa simpson|uh , dad ?
lisa simpson|they turned you into a vampire .
lisa simpson|dad , i think maggie's just sad 'cause her set is missing baby musthave .
lisa simpson|didn't there used to be more texxon stations ?
lisa simpson|someday when i'm a grownup , maybe i'll go back and look fondly at our house .
lisa simpson|wow , mom you got first place in the science fair !
lisa simpson|mom , these grades are amazing !
lisa simpson|just as good as mine !
lisa simpson|principal skinner ?
lisa simpson|quick question .
lisa simpson|is it true my mom was a great student ?
lisa simpson|well ...
lisa simpson|of course that would be great .
lisa simpson|but i see myself making an impact ...
lisa simpson|outside the home .
lisa simpson|maggie , something happened to mom and i'm gonna find out what and when .
lisa simpson|mom's looking good through elementary school ...
lisa simpson|ninth grade , tenth grade , still ridin' the atrain ...
lisa simpson|then suddenly , when she was a high school senior blam !
lisa simpson|what could've happened ?
lisa simpson|dad , can i talk to you for a second ?
lisa simpson|no offense dad , but no boy is gonna distract me from my dreams .
lisa simpson|no !

lisa simpson|i'm gonna make sure nothing distracts me ever !
lisa simpson|okay , i've gotten rid of all of my distractions , diversions , hobbies and ...
lisa simpson|oh my god !
lisa simpson|are you a distraction , or a higher calling ?
lisa simpson|all right , let's see .
lisa simpson|how many jazz musicians led long and happy lives ?
lisa simpson|there's , um ...
lisa simpson|mom , could you keep it down a little ?
lisa simpson|i'm trying to study .
lisa simpson|mom , is something wrong ?
lisa simpson|it's plenty good !
lisa simpson|it's great !
lisa simpson|it's just ...
lisa simpson|not for me .
lisa simpson|what kind of kiss did you get ?
lisa simpson|ice cold .
lisa simpson|oh yeah ?
lisa simpson|the seven of clubs .
lisa simpson|willie !

lisa simpson|i'm attending an academy !
lisa simpson|i'm sorry , i don't really play .
lisa simpson|count me in !
lisa simpson|well , i am so happy to be in your class .
lisa simpson|did you get that the pony was actually me ?
lisa simpson|selfpublished ?
lisa simpson|that school is so great !
lisa simpson|teachers teach so much better when they're paid in money , and not in chickens .
lisa simpson|is mom gonna come up and say goodnight ?
lisa simpson|mom ?
lisa simpson|mom ?
lisa simpson|i see what happened .
lisa simpson|there was no scholarship .
lisa simpson|they said i could attend if you did all their laundry .
lisa simpson|i can't live with that knowledge while trying to get more knowledge .
lisa simpson|mom ...
lisa simpson|i don't want to go to that school .
lisa simpson|because , it's too elitist .
lisa simpson|everyone's parents are in the business .
lisa simpson|i don't know !
lisa simpson|they won't tell me !
lisa simpson|and besides ...
lisa simpson|you were willing to do all this just so i would be happy !
lisa simpson|mom , i'd be honored if i turned out like you .
lisa simpson|mr burns ?
lisa simpson|where's he going ?
lisa simpson|now they're dancing on his grave !
lisa simpson|hm , apparently mr burns is in a state of shock from the trauma he underwent .
lisa simpson|people of springfield , to quote shakespeare , the quality of mercy is not strained ...
lisa simpson|we're called little people and i'm not one .
lisa simpson|what did you do with him ?
lisa simpson|dad , mr burns is here for you again .
lisa simpson|a little tired of revenge , are we ?
lisa simpson|all right .
lisa simpson|not today .
lisa simpson|actually , sir , the man who lived here didn't have many friends .
lisa simpson|but you're a better person than he ever was .
lisa simpson|yes , technically it's you .
lisa simpson|hey , there's a number on him .
lisa simpson|what is it ?
lisa simpson|thank god your son can't see the way you're behaving .
lisa simpson|you said it was boston .
lisa simpson|like those chairs in the music room ?
lisa simpson|huh .
lisa simpson|it's a pigeon .
lisa simpson|the poor guy hurt his wing .
lisa simpson|or , more likely , the phone number of the bird's owner .
lisa simpson|yes , he could fly home , except that he has a broken wing .
lisa simpson|perhaps you and your sarcasm could come to springfield and retrieve him .
lisa simpson|looks like you're gonna have to take care of him , bart .
lisa simpson|no , no ...
lisa simpson|listen , don't tell anyone , but ...
lisa simpson|i can't stand pigeons !
lisa simpson|they're like rats with wings !
lisa simpson|oh ...
lisa simpson|okay , maybe he's not so bad .
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|get off !
lisa simpson|get off !
lisa simpson|get off !
lisa simpson|mom , it's just maggie .
lisa simpson|mom , why am i so repulsed by pigeons ?
lisa simpson|it doesn't make any sense .
lisa simpson|c .
lisa simpson|l .
lisa simpson|unicorns , clamnesty international and , uh ...
lisa simpson|well , those are the best ones .
lisa simpson|really ?
lisa simpson|i'll tell you later .
lisa simpson|it's amazing how i can feel sorry for you and hate you at the same time .
lisa simpson|i'm sure there's a german word for it .
lisa simpson|you're gonna put him down ?
lisa simpson|this is where we're ditching the dog ?
lisa simpson|not really .
lisa simpson|you do for me .
lisa simpson|marking a crime scene .
lisa simpson|you mean your gingerbread mcmansion .
lisa simpson|so you're the brown nosed reindeer that's jingled all the way to the top .
lisa simpson|oh , i know what you're after .
lisa simpson|the toy you never got .
lisa simpson|oh really ?
lisa simpson|well let me ask you this , how many kids bring a gun to meet santa ?
lisa simpson|security !
lisa simpson|why can't they leave a poor tree in the woods where it belongs ?
lisa simpson|can it really be christmas when one of our parents is facing the german army ?
lisa simpson|don't dare bring that thing in here !
lisa simpson|don't worry about that .
lisa simpson|i love meat and i always will .
lisa simpson|mmmmm , that is some sweet pig meat .
lisa simpson|but as for christmas trees ...
lisa simpson|i used to love them until last year , when i went tree shopping with mom ...
lisa simpson|so i never want to see another christmas tree ...
lisa simpson|until mom comes back , safe and sound .
lisa simpson|see ?
lisa simpson|every time we get a tree , mom disappears !
lisa simpson|oh no !
lisa simpson|this is where they took mom from me !
lisa simpson|it's a sign .
lisa simpson|mom's okay !
lisa simpson|thank you .
lisa simpson|yes , but then i learned that there's always hope .
lisa simpson|someday this war will be over .
lisa simpson|someday our mom will be back .
lisa simpson|o tannenbaum , o tannenbaum ...
lisa simpson|nein auch im winter , wenn es schneit ...
lisa simpson|this is the last time i bring these two to bed at the same time .
lisa simpson|ms .
lisa simpson|stewart , i made a star for the tree out of discarded water bottles !
lisa simpson|i'll go outside and make snow angels .
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|merry christmas , mom !
lisa simpson|it's beginning to look a lot like breakfast ...
lisa simpson|did you get a good housesitter ?
lisa simpson|aw , poor baby .
lisa simpson|come on , bart .
lisa simpson|afraid of a little apple juice ?
lisa simpson|dad's underwear !
lisa simpson|happy new year !
lisa simpson|why are you hung over ?
lisa simpson|i didn't see you drink last night .
lisa simpson|your four eyes saw a lot today , milhouse .
lisa simpson|what's the skinny ?
lisa simpson|bart ?
lisa simpson|we've got to stop mom from going out with those women .
lisa simpson|could we hurry this up ?
lisa simpson|i am really uncomfortable being a girl in this store .
lisa simpson|hey , does dad know you and the cool moms broke up ?
lisa simpson|sorry you broke up with your friends , mom .
lisa simpson|come on , pretend he meant something to you .
lisa simpson|i'm busy .
lisa simpson|fine .
lisa simpson|just get in here .
lisa simpson|you could deliver newspapers .
lisa simpson|maybe if you buckle down and get good grades , dad will give you money .
lisa simpson|i've been doing the family's books for years .
lisa simpson|i take what i need .
lisa simpson|something wrong , bart ?
lisa simpson|i love it .
lisa simpson|oh my god , me too !
lisa simpson|i can't take it .
lisa simpson|i'm just going to draw a hairline on .
lisa simpson|help !
lisa simpson|my macaroni marconi !
lisa simpson|huh .
lisa simpson|let's see what cousin jessica's up to .
lisa simpson|you can't listen to those women , mom .
lisa simpson|change threatens them .
lisa simpson|they didn't like it when the springfield shopper started printing in color .
lisa simpson|mom , your choice to go back to blue is so empowering .
lisa simpson|well , as a feminist , virtually anything a woman does is empowering .
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|it's oddly dehumanizing .
lisa simpson|the most comfortable ergonomic chair there is .
lisa simpson|'angry dad the movie .
lisa simpson|' angry dad addresses the family from the top of the stairs .
lisa simpson|angry dad slips and crashes down the stairs .
lisa simpson|no dad , don't say pained noises , you make pained noises .
lisa simpson|you know , your movie's not all bad .
lisa simpson|taylor hackford .
lisa simpson|the creative team from mixar !
lisa simpson|pardon me .
lisa simpson|i believe it's from lamps plus .
lisa simpson|good luck , mr park .
lisa simpson|there'd be no shame in losing to you .
lisa simpson|scorpions !
lisa simpson|they calm down when they're near the springfield silvertongues !
lisa simpson|now they're aggressive again !
lisa simpson|i'm sure there's a correlation , but could there be a ...
lisa simpson|causation ?
lisa simpson|that doesn't seem fair they won't let him escape , then they kick him out .
lisa simpson|i wonder where he'll go .
lisa simpson|this calls for some springfield silvertongue !
lisa simpson|dad , look !
lisa simpson|this essence of a wildflower makes these angry scorpions docile !
lisa simpson|that's him !
lisa simpson|dad , is there anything unusual in grampa's coffee ?
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|i know what you did !
lisa simpson|and i locked the back door !
lisa simpson|and that's why you're acting so sweet and kind .
lisa simpson|because dad drugged you !
lisa simpson|but it's not real happiness .
lisa simpson|it's just because of an untested drug !
lisa simpson|it was wrong of me to play goddess !
lisa simpson|all right , bart .
lisa simpson|what are you up to now ?
lisa simpson|it's okay , grampa you don't have to act grumpy .
lisa simpson|i know you're taking the drug , and i don't mind because you're happy .
lisa simpson|thanks , sweetie .
lisa simpson|i'm sorry i was so stubborn .
lisa simpson|i hope you're not mad .
lisa simpson|let me finish thanks to your wonderful , wonderful drug .
lisa simpson|it happened to the scorpions too !
lisa simpson|look !
lisa simpson|so i guess the lesson here is ...
lisa simpson|cheech and chong are from springfield ?
lisa simpson|these are comedy albums ?
lisa simpson|the noisy minority ...
lisa simpson|the upsidedown bubblegum collective ...
lisa simpson|the regional lampoon ...
lisa simpson|the plymouth grok experiment ...
lisa simpson|fro and flo ...
lisa simpson|allan sherman's helter shmelter ...
lisa simpson|this is so sad .
lisa simpson|can we help her ?
lisa simpson|you mean , just reality .
lisa simpson|so , how was your first day of school ?
lisa simpson|grampa , you're not dead .
lisa simpson|wow !
lisa simpson|you're out of tonic .
lisa simpson|really ?
lisa simpson|can i see it ?
lisa simpson|aw , come on , bart , it's fun !
lisa simpson|that was kind of the same as the first time .
lisa simpson|why did i suggest this ?
lisa simpson|ooh , authentic american folk music , just like they play on n .
lisa simpson|p .
lisa simpson|r .
lisa simpson|initiate phase two .
lisa simpson|affirmative .
lisa simpson|roger .
lisa simpson|where am i ?
lisa simpson|this neighborhood is starting to look a little bit like ...
lisa simpson|sesame street .
lisa simpson|wonder who's in there .
lisa simpson|could it be oscar the ...
lisa simpson|help !
lisa simpson|i'm trapped in an alternate dimension !
lisa simpson|an existential netherspace !
lisa simpson|i've been hey , how ya doin' ?
lisa simpson|no one sent me .
lisa simpson|i just knocked on the door and it opened !
lisa simpson|uh , how'd i get from inside there to over here ?
lisa simpson|sounds like most of the house is still owned by the bank .
lisa simpson|how did you do all that ?
lisa simpson|i do , i do !
lisa simpson|looks like there was magic between you two .
lisa simpson|would you ...
lisa simpson|be interested in teaching me ?
lisa simpson|what if you just taught me one trick ?
lisa simpson|i'm not exactly flattered by that .
lisa simpson|hm .
lisa simpson|and george washington took a trip down the ...
lisa simpson|eary canal !
lisa simpson|from the great raymondo .
lisa simpson|you never even opened it .
lisa simpson|need some help ?
lisa simpson|raymondo !
lisa simpson|i mastered the slide pass and i've almost mastered the denver slide pass ...
lisa simpson|and , why is there always a denver version of things ?
lisa simpson|oh , what's wrong ?
lisa simpson|ew .
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|raymondo's greatest secret !
lisa simpson|no , i shouldn't i won't .
lisa simpson|you are ?
lisa simpson|why ?
lisa simpson|students , teachers , detentionees ...
lisa simpson|prepare to have everything you believe about milk cans challenged !
lisa simpson|willie , if you will ?
lisa simpson|i believe the expression is tada !
lisa simpson|my friends call me lisa .
lisa simpson|shut up !
lisa simpson|now , where were we ?
lisa simpson|oh , it's a lot less dangerous than you think .
lisa simpson|you can see me do it again in a talent show next week .
lisa simpson|there's no chance whatsoever .
lisa simpson|i'll show you .
lisa simpson|you don't open the top the locks are real .
lisa simpson|the can is in two halves , and they slide apart .
lisa simpson|from inside , you just push up .
lisa simpson|easy peasy .
lisa simpson|and there's no way anyone can figure out how it's done .
lisa simpson|raymondo , i am so sorry .
lisa simpson|i got rolled by a pro !
lisa simpson|haven't you ever been fooled by a pretty face ?
lisa simpson|oh , you think i'm pretty ?
lisa simpson|raymondo !
lisa simpson|you forgive me !
lisa simpson|i'll get him out !
lisa simpson|you're just gonna stand there ?
lisa simpson|he's going to die !
lisa simpson|i guess it's up to me to save you , cregg demon magic freek .
lisa simpson|ricky jay ?
lisa simpson|david copperfield ?
lisa simpson|penn ?
lisa simpson|teller ?
lisa simpson|but why ?
lisa simpson|but he doesn't deserve to die .
lisa simpson|raymondo ?
lisa simpson|sold , to the lowest bidder !
lisa simpson|dad , aunt selma's treating a mob boss like an ordinary taxpayer .
lisa simpson|my lick .
lisa simpson|my lick .
lisa simpson|brother germs !
lisa simpson|bart , this is a truffle .
lisa simpson|a truffle is a fungus that grows in tree roots .
lisa simpson|it's one of the most prized gourmet foods in the world .
lisa simpson|bart , you can find them by smell !
lisa simpson|that's amazing !
lisa simpson|restaurateurs use highlytrained pigs to sniff these out .
lisa simpson|interested in these ?
lisa simpson|how many truffles did you get ?
lisa simpson|brown gold ...
lisa simpson|tuscan tea ...
lisa simpson|three more big ones and we'll talk .
lisa simpson|as big as a baby's head .
lisa simpson|that baby's head .
lisa simpson|we haven't even gotten our salads yet .
lisa simpson|i'm sorry , bart !
lisa simpson|take the last truffle ...
lisa simpson|do whatever you want .
lisa simpson|sell it , eat it ...
lisa simpson|bart , you've done a truly kind thing .
lisa simpson|oh , so that's why they don't give pigs truffles .
lisa simpson|bart , this isn't a photograph .
lisa simpson|you just ruined six months' work !
lisa simpson|you're gonna regret the day you were born !
lisa simpson|bart , i'm afraid we need the help of someone older and wiser .
lisa simpson|why don't you just cut the paint out of her hair ?
lisa simpson|cool !
lisa simpson|/ awesome !
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|first of all , it's never wise to use the word spew in a love song .
lisa simpson|i'm sorry , but i don't love you , milhouse , and i never will .
lisa simpson|oh .
lisa simpson|usually , milhouse does it .
lisa simpson|why would a popular fifthgrader like taffy be interested in a milhouse like milhouse ?
lisa simpson|well , i'm gonna find out why , because this ...
lisa simpson|hmm ...
lisa simpson|shut up !
lisa simpson|i just want to know what she's up to with milhouse .
lisa simpson|a girl like her could get a fifth grader maybe even kyle lobianco !
lisa simpson|that's the first thing everyone knows about kyle lobianco !
lisa simpson|taffy's up to something .
lisa simpson|and i won't find out what it is sitting at a computer .
lisa simpson|it's time to get boots on the ground .
lisa simpson|you like my boots ?
lisa simpson|who'd follow milhouse around like that ?
lisa simpson|sneaking around after them all day has taught me a lot about this sicko .
lisa simpson|i am never gonna get my homework done tonight .
lisa simpson|all right , sister .
lisa simpson|what's your game ?
lisa simpson|i am so sorry .
lisa simpson|milhouse , i ...
lisa simpson|i ...
lisa simpson|yes ...
lisa simpson|no ...
lisa simpson|i don't know !
lisa simpson|it means that ...
lisa simpson|that life is full of unexpected things and you should never give up .
lisa simpson|and you're cute in the moonlight .
lisa simpson|dad , our lives !
lisa simpson|maggie's locked in !
lisa simpson|what's this key with the plastic skull for ?
lisa simpson|so how come we have all these other keys ?
lisa simpson|i'll return this to the school .
lisa simpson|returning this lost key to principal skinner .
lisa simpson|well , maybe a little .
lisa simpson|but i'd never break the rules .
lisa simpson|banned books ?
lisa simpson|band books ?
lisa simpson|could this key open ...
lisa simpson|get thee behind me namuche !
lisa simpson|that's the buddhist satan .
lisa simpson|let's give it a shot .
lisa simpson|no problem , just some cobwebs .
lisa simpson|i've discovered a mystery , wrapped in a riddle in the basement of a lousy school !
lisa simpson|it's like five classrooms in one !
lisa simpson|a science room ...
lisa simpson|student lounge ...
lisa simpson|mathnasium ...
lisa simpson|an experimental theater !
lisa simpson|all set for a production of samuel beckett's endgame !
lisa simpson|ooh , a pulldown map of ...
lisa simpson|nothing ?
lisa simpson|and this ruler is unmarked and ...
lisa simpson|the tabs on this popup book have no effect ...
lisa simpson|and this tooth has no dentin !
lisa simpson|everything is fake !
lisa simpson|what is going on ?
lisa simpson|principal skinner , do you know anything about a bizarre hidden classroom underneath the school ?
lisa simpson|it's real .
lisa simpson|i can show you !
lisa simpson|you're just pressing a mento .
lisa simpson|and now without further ado , i give you ...
lisa simpson|this !
lisa simpson|i swear there was a room here !
lisa simpson|i've got to get back in that room , but skinner took away the only key !
lisa simpson|what would nancy drew do ?
lisa simpson|hi , my name is lisa simpson .
lisa simpson|that's us .
lisa simpson|do you think you could reproduce the key in this photo ?
lisa simpson|how much ?
lisa simpson|keep the change .
lisa simpson|how did this bookshelf get here so fast ?
lisa simpson|i bet it's shoddy .
lisa simpson|what do you think of that , nancy drew ?
lisa simpson|jeez , they're dropping like flies .
lisa simpson|the children are on bus 23 .
lisa simpson|skinner's involved in this .
lisa simpson|deep .
lisa simpson|you know anything about ...
lisa simpson|bus twentythree ?
lisa simpson|which is probably the third one .
lisa simpson|so the answer to our mystery lies on the other side of that ice bridge .
lisa simpson|that's where the ice bridge would be !
lisa simpson|go down !
lisa simpson|dad , stop !
lisa simpson|that's not a real arm it's plastic !
lisa simpson|no , i mean they're mannequins !
lisa simpson|skinner and chalmers loaded that bus with those kids ...
lisa simpson|but why ?
lisa simpson|otto ?
lisa simpson|are you the one who left the message on the blackboard ?
lisa simpson|otto , they're just mannequins !
lisa simpson|luckily , as equipment manager , i ...
lisa simpson|was not ...
lisa simpson|invited !
lisa simpson|woohoo !
lisa simpson|actually , i do have a speech prepared !
lisa simpson|you know i hate surprises !
lisa simpson|i like routine .
lisa simpson|i like routine .
lisa simpson|please !
lisa simpson|i went through my t .
lisa simpson|r .
lisa simpson|phase in first grade .
lisa simpson|now i realize that the greatest roosevelt is franklin .
lisa simpson|yeah , so he could shoot it himself .
lisa simpson|franklin roosevelt led this country through the depression and world war two !
lisa simpson|face on a dime !
lisa simpson|that's a lot of anger , grampa .
lisa simpson|bart , what are you doing ?
lisa simpson|what ?
lisa simpson|i'm telling mom !
lisa simpson|hello , mom ?
lisa simpson|you won't believe what bart's doing .
lisa simpson|dad , i'm going to entertain you with the help of the brothers karamazov .
lisa simpson|alexey fyodorovitch karamazov was the third son of fyodor pavlovitch karamazov ...
lisa simpson|daad !
lisa simpson|anyway , continuing for the present i will only say that this 'landowner' for so ...
lisa simpson|ew , dad !
lisa simpson|wait a minute ...
lisa simpson|can you pass gas at will ?
lisa simpson|fart once for no , twice for yes .
lisa simpson|oh my god !
lisa simpson|do you realize what this means ?
lisa simpson|well , it means that you can communicate !
lisa simpson|exactly !
lisa simpson|i'll recite the alphabet , and you tell me when to stop .
lisa simpson|abcd ...
lisa simpson|okay , first letter d .
lisa simpson|d , e ...
lisa simpson|amazing !
lisa simpson|oh , but before we continue ...
lisa simpson|d , e , a ...
lisa simpson|i miss holding you in my arms more than my butt can say .
lisa simpson|perhaps someday there will be a cure .
lisa simpson|although if it requires months of difficult physical therapy , i'll pass .
lisa simpson|you are the shining light that gets me through my darkest hours .
lisa simpson|for further communication i will require more beans .

lisa simpson|can you believe publishers would lie to their readers just to make an easy million bucks ?
lisa simpson|and they just cash their checks and get away with it every time !

lisa simpson|who am i kidding ?
lisa simpson|there will never be a book with my name on it .

lisa simpson|i'm in .
lisa simpson|i was raised in a traveling circus .
lisa simpson|my mother was a lady ringmaster and my father was a lion barber .
lisa simpson|i wrote my first story with clown lipstick on a flattened popcorn box .
lisa simpson|it was featured in the new yorker's best forty under four issue .
lisa simpson|what happened to me ?
lisa simpson|in one vulnerable moment i became the thing i hated most a literary fraud .
lisa simpson|aww , i've always wanted an aiden ...
lisa simpson|no , guys ...
lisa simpson|it was me .
lisa simpson|my name is finally on a book !
lisa simpson|and they're letting me write the sequel !
lisa simpson|i'm sorry .
lisa simpson|no need to thank me , boys .
lisa simpson|you could never have printed your version of the book without the publisher's password ...
lisa simpson|so i pretended to betray you ...
lisa simpson|then after he typed the password ...
lisa simpson|i secretly switched the flash drives .
lisa simpson|i got the idea from every movie ever made .
lisa simpson|and the best part is , my face is still on the back flap .
lisa simpson|gaiman !

lisa simpson|moom , what are you doing ?
lisa simpson|why can't we visit a real museum ?
lisa simpson|one that doesn't have the skeletons of the three stooges in the lobby ?
lisa simpson|hm , they're selling off all the old tv relics .
lisa simpson|i liked the knowledgeable docents .
lisa simpson|krusty ?
lisa simpson|well , you're not exactly my hero .
lisa simpson|i see you more as a cautionary tale .

lisa simpson|it's too early to call shotgun !
lisa simpson|dad , you outtalked the talking heads !
lisa simpson|so , what's this with the gravy boat ?
lisa simpson|you know , symbols can often rile people up .
lisa simpson|the swastika ...
lisa simpson|the new york yankees logo ...
lisa simpson|um , none .
lisa simpson|dad , you shouldn't do this .
lisa simpson|it's not fair how much influence you have !
lisa simpson|you're endorsing ted nugent for president ?
lisa simpson|he's a rightwing rock star who likes everything i hate !
lisa simpson|dad , you cannot endorse ted nugent .
lisa simpson|i mean , sure , we all love his music ...
lisa simpson|no question about it .
lisa simpson|but he's out of his mind he can't run for president !
lisa simpson|oh , dad !
lisa simpson|i'm so glad you've heard the voice of reason .
lisa simpson|dad , no !
lisa simpson|maybe because deep down , you know you don't believe in what you're doing .
lisa simpson|i knew you were , dad .
lisa simpson|i always knew .
lisa simpson|well , it all started a couple of months ago ...
lisa simpson|like all too many stories about my family , it began with somebody watching television .
lisa simpson|hm , i kinda want to create my own thing .
lisa simpson|do you sell any just plain sets ?
lisa simpson|well , i'll just buy one of these and build something different .
lisa simpson|trust me , i've left a lot out , and cleaned up the swears .
lisa simpson|anyway , i ran into some schoolmates and thought they might be friendly .
lisa simpson|that's what kids do , right ?
lisa simpson|hang out at the mall together .
lisa simpson|but when i went over ...
lisa simpson|hi , guys , what are you doing ?
lisa simpson|can i join you ?
lisa simpson|theythey don't ?
lisa simpson|i have no friends .
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|i'd have more friends if i knew what people liked .
lisa simpson|but i won't know what people like unless i'm their friend .
lisa simpson|it's a conundrum .
lisa simpson|hm ...
lisa simpson|it's easier to be friends with lots of people online than one person in person .
lisa simpson|no , that is not true !
lisa simpson|all right already !
lisa simpson|i had no friends .
lisa simpson|did we become friends ?
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|nelson , you've just given us the template for our site !
lisa simpson|i never said it was diabolical !

lisa simpson|i know it's awful and insular , and caused thirtyfive deaths , but i had friends !
lisa simpson|four digits of friends !
lisa simpson|i had a friend in common with malcolm gladwell !
lisa simpson|fine .
lisa simpson|i'll shut down the site .
lisa simpson|you really want me ?

lisa simpson|even a kid who wears a finding nemo back brace has some pride .
lisa simpson|you went too far this time , bart .
lisa simpson|yes i did .
lisa simpson|now i'm going to bed .
lisa simpson|your bar is the closest thing this town has to an algonquin roundtable .
lisa simpson|yeah , yeah , okay , second closest .
lisa simpson|sorry , sorry , i didn't mean to be nosey .
lisa simpson|you have a way with words .
lisa simpson|mom , i'm gonna look at the desserts !

lisa simpson|somehow i missed that phase .
lisa simpson|the boy i like is hemingwayesque !
lisa simpson|wow , nick here in our house .
lisa simpson|i hope it doesn't make him think less of me .
lisa simpson|nick and i met talking through a crack between two booths !
lisa simpson|grampa , would you help take me on a foolish romantic mission ?
lisa simpson|mulberry island .
lisa simpson|we'll kiss there at sunset .
lisa simpson|ow !
lisa simpson|if we stop now , we'll never make it there by sunset .
lisa simpson|but grampa ...
lisa simpson|we could take this boat .
lisa simpson|i thought you rowed up the zambezi without a guide .
lisa simpson|you know , you were a lot more adventurous at the dessert table .
lisa simpson|shut up and kiss me .
lisa simpson|wait , how long is this love for again ?
lisa simpson|hm , that's a pretty long time .
lisa simpson|thanks .
lisa simpson|but i couldn't have done it , mom .
lisa simpson|i know it's futile , but i must again point out there is no dragon .
lisa simpson|again , i maintain that money would be better spent on car insurance .
lisa simpson|i pick up books like you pick up beers !
lisa simpson|do we really have to sit here the whole time ?
lisa simpson|i could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana !
lisa simpson|if i didn't know better , i'd say it was a town meeting .
lisa simpson|why would you want to banish us from springfield ?
lisa simpson|dad , where are we going ?
lisa simpson|do we have a plan ?
lisa simpson|ahhh , smell that unpolluted air !
lisa simpson|y'know , i'm glad we're in exile .

lisa simpson|but , you still , i mean ...
lisa simpson|i suppose you're right .

lisa simpson|he's my dad .
lisa simpson|he worked two jobs to get me a pony ...
lisa simpson|he started me playing the saxophone you all love ...

lisa simpson|gus huebner ?

lisa simpson|happy mother's day .
lisa simpson|great !
lisa simpson|but from now on , we have to be totally honest with each other .
lisa simpson|our lord , buddha , says the secret of existence is to pass beyond fear .
lisa simpson|my brother is about to meet fear , and as usual , he won't pass .
lisa simpson|the last day of school .
lisa simpson|field day .
lisa simpson|when you learn to balance an egg on a spoon ...
lisa simpson|and run with your leg tied to someone who wouldn't talk to you all year .
lisa simpson|hey !
lisa simpson|are you coming to the afterschool pool party ?
lisa simpson|and like he did with every multiple choice question he ever saw , bart chose b .
lisa simpson|bart won a blue ribbon ...
lisa simpson|but was it worth it ?
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|i'm narrating !
lisa simpson|fine .
lisa simpson|fourth of july fireworks were a different story .
lisa simpson|they meant more to my dad than my mom could ever know .
lisa simpson|it was the one night of every year that he never heard his parents argue .
lisa simpson|he figured it was because they loved the fireworks just as much as he did .
lisa simpson|with his mom gone , homer needed a hero .
lisa simpson|and no one was a bigger hero than the magical little man behind the controls .
lisa simpson|while bart was in hell , homer was happily surrounded by fire and brimstone .
lisa simpson|so milhouse got the redemption he deserved ...
lisa simpson|and so , in a way , did bart .
lisa simpson|which meant that at long last , my brother could get a good night's sleep .
lisa simpson|three feet , nine inches .
lisa simpson|that should do it .
lisa simpson|okay , enough theory .
lisa simpson|krusty's getting roasted tonight .
lisa simpson|dad , are you okay ?
lisa simpson|dad , you're eating too much !
lisa simpson|i'm worried about your health !
lisa simpson|i don't wanna lose you !
lisa simpson|oh no .
lisa simpson|mom ?
lisa simpson|dad ?
lisa simpson|i've been listening , and dad stops breathing for as long as five minutes .
lisa simpson|mind if i sleep with you guys and keep an eye on him ?
lisa simpson|wrapping you in bubble wrap .
lisa simpson|i can't always be around to protect you , so it will .
lisa simpson|i guess you're right .
lisa simpson|that's all i wanted a tiny bit of control .
lisa simpson|i know , but they're not gonna waste a whole saturday inside .
lisa simpson|i've got an idea ...
lisa simpson|but i'll need that broccoli .
lisa simpson|these two fruit smoothies look and taste exactly the same .
lisa simpson|one of them , however , has the broccoli blended in .
lisa simpson|mom , it's trash talk .
lisa simpson|she's under a lot of stress .
lisa simpson|her husband's at sea .
lisa simpson|dad , dogs don't know when to stop eating .
lisa simpson|hey mom , can you pack me a dozen sandwiches in my lunch tomorrow ?
lisa simpson|meat , no meat , it's all good .
lisa simpson|no , whenever anything bothers me i harmlessly vent it to maggie .
lisa simpson|kids love 'em .
lisa simpson|we trade them at school .
lisa simpson|wow , mom !
lisa simpson|you're gonna open a sandwich store ?
lisa simpson|what's wrong ?
lisa simpson|this is so sad .
lisa simpson|in his homeland , dad was a nuclear engineer .
lisa simpson|no , no .
lisa simpson|you want to make american kids work ?
lisa simpson|um , i'm not sure this is the best use of my skills .
lisa simpson|one jumbo joe to go !
lisa simpson|one florence nightingale in a box and make it snappy !
lisa simpson|really bart ?
lisa simpson|hm , looks like ancient aramaic .
lisa simpson|fortunately , i have an app for that .
lisa simpson|hey !
lisa simpson|docetism ?
lisa simpson|making fun of someone's clothes .
lisa simpson|how original .
lisa simpson|it's true !
lisa simpson|it would be a cold day in hell when i was popular .
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|i found a portal back to earth .
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|that's super hell !
lisa simpson|dad , the tv's screwed up .
lisa simpson|it only plays married ...
lisa simpson|with children .
lisa simpson|this house is haunted !
lisa simpson|noble spirits , your time has passed .
lisa simpson|that was unmotivated .
lisa simpson|shut up !
lisa simpson|well , i guess you and i are in charge now , bart .
lisa simpson|but if we split the chores , i'm sure we can ...
lisa simpson|what are you doing ?
lisa simpson|oh no !
lisa simpson|you're not leaving me to clean this up !
lisa simpson|flaming tap water .
lisa simpson|i saw something about that in a documentary ...
lisa simpson|this one ...
lisa simpson|maybe a satellite picture will give us a clue .
lisa simpson|this is clearly a fracking site .
lisa simpson|how are they keeping people away ?
lisa simpson|this whole building is just a façade for a drilling operation .
lisa simpson|but i know someone who can help ...
lisa simpson|the first female speaker of the state assembly ...
lisa simpson|a politician who would never ignore a fellow environmentalist in need ...
lisa simpson|my hero ...
lisa simpson|maxine lombard .
lisa simpson|assemblywoman lombard !
lisa simpson|you got my emails !
lisa simpson|how could you sell fracking for mr burns ?
lisa simpson|i am judging you .
lisa simpson|what !
lisa simpson|yeees .
lisa simpson|probably just another piece of america's space junk falling out of orbit .
lisa simpson|you know , they look a little similar .
lisa simpson|a little lazy if you ask me .
lisa simpson|regardless , i see no reason to believe that bender is from the future .
lisa simpson|robotic technology today is very advanced .
lisa simpson|it's not my birthday .
lisa simpson|although maggie's is pretty soon .
lisa simpson|this is the robot who claims to be from the future .
lisa simpson|what stopped you , bender ?
lisa simpson|asimov's three laws of robotics ?
lisa simpson|wait , stop !
lisa simpson|why must you kill my dad ?
lisa simpson|especially when cheeseburgers are doing the work for you ?
lisa simpson|professor farnsworth , i'm dying to know how you got here .
lisa simpson|was it a time machine ?
lisa simpson|that's it !
lisa simpson|all we have to do is dig up the time capsule !
lisa simpson|what a surprise it's bart .
lisa simpson|i can't believe you're all giving up without a fight .
lisa simpson|let me take care of that .
lisa simpson|if there's one thing i know how to do , it's manipulate barts .
lisa simpson|dad , we have beer in our time !
lisa simpson|attention goblins madison cube garden is filled with butterfinger bars .
lisa simpson|and people are laying fingers all over them .
lisa simpson|they're evolving !
lisa simpson|wow .
lisa simpson|that's a first for you , bart .
lisa simpson|wait , wait , wait !
lisa simpson|you're the portal .
lisa simpson|how are you going to get to the future ?
lisa simpson|why are you wearing your hat at dinner ?
lisa simpson|we're sorry .
lisa simpson|excuse me , but buzzard's roost is a converted parking lot .
lisa simpson|parking lot .
lisa simpson|parking lot .
lisa simpson|hello ?

lisa simpson|it's so cool to have another musician in the family !
lisa simpson|yeah , you really get that it's all about the music .
lisa simpson|dad , you shouldn't be jealous of apu .
lisa simpson|remember , it's all about the music .
lisa simpson|wow , he's right .
lisa simpson|mom , where's dad ?
lisa simpson|bart , bart , i hear mom sobbing and i don't know where dad is !
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|this is the year i've got to nail christmas .
lisa simpson|i don't want to be a jaded tenyearold like you !
lisa simpson|mom , i'm just a kid .
lisa simpson|i'm afraid we've awoken a needy giant .
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|you know you can't open a present till mom and dad wake up !
lisa simpson|oops .
lisa simpson|so did mine .
lisa simpson|i got a chemistry set !
lisa simpson|are we there yet ?
lisa simpson|are we there yet ?
lisa simpson|are we there yet ?
lisa simpson|are we there yet ?

lisa simpson|this is us .

lisa simpson|are we there yet ?
lisa simpson|whoa , this place sure has changed since dizznee bought the rights to cosmic wars .
lisa simpson|they revamped this ride because of massive complaints from two people .
lisa simpson|dad , i don't know about this .
lisa simpson|it's not on the park map .
lisa simpson|we've left earth's atmosphere !
lisa simpson|are we there yet ?
lisa simpson|are we there yet ?
lisa simpson|are we there yet ?
lisa simpson|are we truly in space ?
lisa simpson|and if so , why ?
lisa simpson|why does the last thing you say sound so ominous ?
lisa simpson|you mean like europeans were to the native americans ?
lisa simpson|or the belgians were to the congo ?
lisa simpson|now what ?
lisa simpson|are there any side effects ?
lisa simpson|so , you use a lot of solar energy ?
lisa simpson|why are you sharing all of this with us ?

lisa simpson|i win , i think .
lisa simpson|thanks .
lisa simpson|i thought it was a ball !
lisa simpson|here you go .
lisa simpson|now do you see why i'm a vegetarian , dad ?
lisa simpson|it's called a knot .
lisa simpson|knot with a k .
lisa simpson|that's correct .
lisa simpson|this system is really rigged against us .
lisa simpson|um , are you sure you don't want to try me again ?
lisa simpson|really ?
lisa simpson|but i thought ...
lisa simpson|right .
lisa simpson|conquering .
lisa simpson|like three bean salad at a barbecue , we will remain untouched .
lisa simpson|i thought we weren't allowed to do homework at the table .
lisa simpson|i knew he wasn't gonna like the stack parking .
lisa simpson|you know , dad , studies show being hypnotized makes you more efficient .
lisa simpson|i just wanted to see him cluck like a chicken .
lisa simpson|mom , dad's been hypnotized to think he was ten !
lisa simpson|so ...
lisa simpson|where is he gonna sleep ?
lisa simpson|i'm done .
lisa simpson|not right now .
lisa simpson|listen , homer .
lisa simpson|i've been emotionally dealing with that all week .
lisa simpson|so , yes .
lisa simpson|look , dad had to get cured some time .
lisa simpson|there's nothing we can do about it .
lisa simpson|whoa !
lisa simpson|looks like our bird house is benefitting from positive word of beak .
lisa simpson|a bald eagle !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|let's take the eagle to shelbyville animal rescue .
lisa simpson|where you took that injured hummingbird you found on the front lawn .

lisa simpson|elon musk is possibly the greatest living inventor !
lisa simpson|his company perfected electric cars and then gave away the patents !
lisa simpson|he changed the way hollywood drives !
lisa simpson|that's so sad .
lisa simpson|hi , i didn't want to miss one more chance to spend time with mr musk .
lisa simpson|it is such an honor .
lisa simpson|he is .
lisa simpson|and may i save that paper ?
lisa simpson|no ideas ?
lisa simpson|oh , that's sad .
lisa simpson|that's even worse !
lisa simpson|he's taking your homerisms and turning them into his own great ideas !
lisa simpson|bye !
lisa simpson|bart , what are you doing ?
lisa simpson|foolish boy .
lisa simpson|you'll never guess elon musk's master password .
lisa simpson|i just wanted to see if there was a better life .
lisa simpson|even for a little bit .
lisa simpson|i guess humanity wants its change one birdhouse at a time .
lisa simpson|hm .
lisa simpson|for a man who likes electric cars , he sure burns a lot of rocket fuel .
lisa simpson|what's wrong , dad ?
lisa simpson|i still believe in this town ...
lisa simpson|a town that deserves its own original song !
lisa simpson|and as an aspiring musician with offbroadway dreams , i'm the one to write it !
lisa simpson|let's see ...

lisa simpson|we did it !
lisa simpson|we wrote an awesome song !

lisa simpson|that works .
lisa simpson|but to be frank , there's not a lot to recommend it ...
lisa simpson|we've got a big sinkhole ...
lisa simpson|hashtag springfield pride has never ever trended .
lisa simpson|but when you think of the things we lack ...
lisa simpson|mom , what's wrong ?
lisa simpson|do you really think that we can write a song that does that ?
lisa simpson|take it , bart !

lisa simpson|wait a minute .
lisa simpson|krusty can't read .
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|don't you get it , bart ?
lisa simpson|how could krusty have been reading a magazine if he can't read ?
lisa simpson|bart , i'm starting to think you're right .
lisa simpson|krusty was framed .
lisa simpson|did he have any enemies ?
lisa simpson|sideshow bob !
lisa simpson|come on , bart .

lisa simpson|we caught her !
lisa simpson|we caught the babysitter bandit !
lisa simpson|she's tied up at our house right now !

lisa simpson|he doesn't care , mom .
lisa simpson|well , okay .

lisa simpson|i heard you last night , bart .
lisa simpson|you prayed for this .
lisa simpson|now your prayers have been answered .

lisa simpson|an absence of mood swings and some stability in my life .

lisa simpson|why are you trying to scare us ?
lisa simpson|are you trying to keep us from getting close to you ...
lisa simpson|maybe even loving you ?
lisa simpson|it chose to destroy itself rather than live with us .
lisa simpson|you can't help but feel a little rejected .
lisa simpson|that wasn't scary at all , bart .
lisa simpson|heh ...
lisa simpson|heh ...
lisa simpson|heh .
lisa simpson|look , i know that to you we simpsons are a lower order of life .

lisa simpson|if you don't believe me , look at this book i found .

lisa simpson|try not to spill anything , dad .
lisa simpson|oooo , a political discussion at our table .

lisa simpson|mr burns , your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train .
lisa simpson|why are you so popular ?
lisa simpson|hmmm .
lisa simpson|yes , sir .
lisa simpson|a very inane one .
lisa simpson|mr burns , your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train .
lisa simpson|why are you so popular ?
lisa simpson|oh mom , that felt awful .
lisa simpson|but mom , we've become the tools of evil .
lisa simpson|mr burns , i hardly see what destroying our meager possessions is going to accomplish .
lisa simpson|yeah , you throw like me .
lisa simpson|we want a catcher / not a belly scratcher !
lisa simpson|our lives have taken an odd turn .
lisa simpson|i can't leave springfield .
lisa simpson|i was born here and i thought i would die here .
lisa simpson|but , dad .
lisa simpson|we're simple people with simple values .
lisa simpson|capital city is too big and too complex .
lisa simpson|everyone in springfield knows us and has forgiven us .
lisa simpson|whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger .
lisa simpson|the pennyloafer !
lisa simpson|capital city yeah !
lisa simpson|there he is !
lisa simpson|mom , what's he doing wrong ?
lisa simpson|but i can't go back !

lisa simpson|if i win , i'll bring home a brand new protractor .
lisa simpson|hi , bart .

lisa simpson|anecdotes , eisenhower and , fashion , humor , japanese obsession with ...
lisa simpson|ah , here it is .
lisa simpson|putting .
lisa simpson|bart , we're just gonna borrow them .
lisa simpson|i want you to shut off the logical part of your mind .
lisa simpson|embrace nothingness .
lisa simpson|become like an uncarved stone .
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|you're just pretending to know what i'm talking about .
lisa simpson|well , it's very frustrating .
lisa simpson|bart , i have a riddle for you what's the sound of one hand clapping ?
lisa simpson|no , bart .
lisa simpson|it's a threethousandyearold riddle with no answer .
lisa simpson|it's supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought .
lisa simpson|but bart , how can a sound exist if there's no one there to hear it ?
lisa simpson|it is time .
lisa simpson|the basis of this game seems to be simple geometry .
lisa simpson|all you have to do is hit the ball here .
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|eighth hole .
lisa simpson|twelfth hole .
lisa simpson|nirvana .
lisa simpson|mom , bart is on a strict diet of complex carbohydrates .
lisa simpson|steak will make him logy .
lisa simpson|oatmeal .
lisa simpson|oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she wins the kentucky derby .
lisa simpson|but here goes .
lisa simpson|i believe in you .
lisa simpson|why do i get the feeling that someday i'll be describing this to a psychiatrist ?
lisa simpson|bart , cut it out !
lisa simpson|it's not yours , bart !
lisa simpson|this is family glue !
lisa simpson|dad , this isn't about glue .
lisa simpson|it's about territoriality .
lisa simpson|he only wants the glue because i'm using it .
lisa simpson|here .
lisa simpson|maggie , i'm about to unveil my centerpiece to the family !
lisa simpson|it's a tribute to the trailblazing women who made our country great ...
lisa simpson|see , there's georgia o'keefe ...
lisa simpson|susan b .
lisa simpson|anthony ...
lisa simpson|and this is marjorie stoneman douglas .
lisa simpson|as one of the simpson women , would you like to contribute something to it ?
lisa simpson|oh , thank you .
lisa simpson|i couldn't tell you how many hours .
lisa simpson|it was a labor of love .
lisa simpson|it's the centerpiece , bart !
lisa simpson|hey , bart , stop it !
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|baaart !
lisa simpson|you're wrecking it !
lisa simpson|let go !
lisa simpson|i worked forever on this !
lisa simpson|baaarrtt !
lisa simpson|you don't even care !
lisa simpson|you don't even care !
lisa simpson|that's all right .
lisa simpson|mom , i poured my heart into that centerpiece !

lisa simpson|howl of the unappreciated , by lisa simpson .

lisa simpson|bart ...
lisa simpson|where are you ?
lisa simpson|bart , what are you doing up here ?
lisa simpson|everybody's worried .
lisa simpson|yes .
lisa simpson|bart , why did you burn my centerpiece ?
lisa simpson|was it because you hate me , or because you're bad ?
lisa simpson|just tell me you're sorry .
lisa simpson|just look !
lisa simpson|apology accepted .
lisa simpson|yes , but i'm afraid the forces of history have changed wrestling , perhaps forever .
lisa simpson|oh , bart , i hope you're not taking this seriously .
lisa simpson|even a fiveyearold knows that this is as choreographed as any ballet .
lisa simpson|aren't you forgetting something ?
lisa simpson|i'll be playing my first solo .
lisa simpson|i reached him .
lisa simpson|dad ?
lisa simpson|another barrier broken .
lisa simpson|right on , sister !
lisa simpson|stop !
lisa simpson|springfield gorge ?
lisa simpson|bart , you'll be killed !
lisa simpson|please , before you do anything , there's someone i'd like you to talk to .
lisa simpson|thank you for arranging this , dr hibbert .
lisa simpson|mr murdock , my brother is thinking about jumping springfield gorge on a skateboard .
lisa simpson|but captain murdock !
lisa simpson|i'm sorry , bart .
lisa simpson|hey , mom .
lisa simpson|what're doing ?
lisa simpson|/we were watching that !
lisa simpson|but , mom !
lisa simpson|and i'm going over to janey's again .

lisa simpson|making the most of our childhood years .
lisa simpson|we will .
lisa simpson|there's peas everywhere .
lisa simpson|there she is !
lisa simpson|all right !
lisa simpson|itchy and scratchy seem to have lost their edge .
lisa simpson|maybe there's something else to do on this planet .
lisa simpson|and janey and i went bird watching .
lisa simpson|we saw a grackle .
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|may we please be excused ?
lisa simpson|excuse me , mr hutz .
lisa simpson|are you a shyster ?
lisa simpson|hello , dr hibbert .
lisa simpson|dad , may i please make an observation ?
lisa simpson|thursday meatloaf night .

lisa simpson|friday night , pork chops .
lisa simpson|from cradle to grave ...
lisa simpson|etched in stone in god's library somewhere ...
lisa simpson|anywhere but hamburgers , pizza or fried chicken .
lisa simpson|as usual , the playground has the facts right , but missed the point entirely .
lisa simpson|sushi is considered quite a delicacy .
lisa simpson|please , dad .
lisa simpson|this argument humiliates us both .
lisa simpson|nothing , but you might say yes the ninetyninth time .
lisa simpson|please , dad .
lisa simpson|please , dad .
lisa simpson|please , dad .
lisa simpson|please , dad .

lisa simpson|john shaft .
lisa simpson|hi , dad .

lisa simpson|why ?
lisa simpson|why are we using the good china ?
lisa simpson|why are we waiting for dad ?
lisa simpson|dad , do something !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|how romantic .
lisa simpson|it's so hard to picture you two then .
lisa simpson|hand in hand at the crossroads of life .
lisa simpson|there are so many questions .
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|uh ...
lisa simpson|how did dad propose to you ?
lisa simpson|so , it was love at first sight .
lisa simpson|why you cagey ol' dog .
lisa simpson|cable ?
lisa simpson|/ us ?
lisa simpson|/ wow !
lisa simpson|/ we have cable !
lisa simpson|dad , are you sure this isn't stealing ?
lisa simpson|mom , what are you doing ?
lisa simpson|well , don't you remember the eighth commandment ?
lisa simpson|thou shalt not steal !
lisa simpson|dad , why is the world such a cesspool of corruption ?
lisa simpson|well , at sunday school we learned that stealing is a sin .
lisa simpson|but everybody does it !
lisa simpson|i mean , we're stealing cable as we speak .
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|no , i didn't .
lisa simpson|dad , i think that's pretty spurious .
lisa simpson|i see .
lisa simpson|maybe .
lisa simpson|i don't watch him every minute .
lisa simpson|but what i am sure of is , we're getting cable for free .
lisa simpson|should i have my father arrested ?
lisa simpson|thank you , reverend lovejoy .
lisa simpson|hi , dad .
lisa simpson|i think stealing cable is wrong .
lisa simpson|so i'm choosing not to watch it in the hope that others will follow my example .
