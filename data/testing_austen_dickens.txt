dickens|Hear this!
dickens|If you had sent the message, Recalled to Life, again, muttered Jerry, as he turned, I should have known what you meant, this time.
austen|I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr Martin.
austen|Miss Smith, the step at the turning.
austen|Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.
austen|, were highly blameable.
dickens|Orlick, as if he had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman, was very soon among the coaldust, and in no hurry to come out of it.
austen|Oh!
austen|I am no flatterer.
austen|On their being joined by Mr Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.
austen|I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.
austen|I was thereone of the party.
dickens|asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows.
dickens|It was Old Orlick as you tumbled over on your stairs that night.
dickens|moaned Miss Havisham, with her former action.
dickens|I was ready to go.
austen|Not unfrequently, through Emmas persuasion, he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening parties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a cardtable for him.
dickens|Ask another.
dickens|I say farewell to her by you.
austen|Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn.
austen|said John Knightley.
austen|To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point.
austen|And I think you will agree with me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my nieces.
dickens|I was in mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal terror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had no hope of deliverance through my allpowerful sister, who repulsed me at every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on requirement, in the secrecy of my terror.
dickens|For the rest, he was a young gentleman in a gray suit when not denuded for battle, with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in advance of the rest of him as to development.
austen|John Knightley came; but Mr Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day.
dickens|You made your own snares.
dickens|These little instruments of correction, these gentle aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity.
austen|While Sir William was with them, Mr Collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own bookroom, which fronted the road.
austen|to be always doing more than she wished, and less than she ought!
dickens|Youre religious, too.
austen|Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?
austen|Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell, was not it?
austen|Mr Woodhouse was quite at ease; and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the chief of even Emmas vexation.
dickens|At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.
austen|Not that James ever complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can.
austen|You seem shut out from every thingin the most complete retirement.
dickens|Wild as my inward hurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand that, unless he had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all human knowledge, he would never have told me what he had told.
dickens|He took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negrohead, when, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to think it might perplex the thread of his narrative.
dickens|From this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.
dickens|The house with the bowwindow, said Wemmick, being by the riverside, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and being kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to let, Mr Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that as a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard?
dickens|We know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for her dear sake.
austen|He was silent.
austen|Oh!
austen|Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me.
dickens|I did?
dickens|Dare I ask you to explain?
austen|And from her great, her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs Elton for being there, Emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.
dickens|It was the first time I had ever seen them opposed.
austen|If it were to be shared with the woman he loved, he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house.
austen|It may bring many extenuations.
austen|and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth.
dickens|In all of which particulars he was very like the dog.
austen|The error has been all my own; and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.
dickens|Are you tired, Estella?
dickens|My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my advice.
austen|It was to this effect  Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming yoube assured that we are all well.
austen|But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.
austen|Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.
dickens|She said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that Quarter, near the Bankinghouse.
austen|She had frequently thoughtespecially since his fathers marriage with Miss Taylorthat if she were to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition.
austen|She is a standing lesson of how to be happy.
dickens|If you could kindly mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging.
austen|Mrs Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all Miss Bingleys witticisms on fine eyes.
austen|I never met with anybody who delighted me so much.
dickens|Well; but dont cry, said the gentle Mr Lorry.
austen|He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend.
austen|Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr Robert Martin.
dickens|Look at your clothes; better aint to be got!
austen|Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.
dickens|Why sure you dont mean to say, Pip, that there was no black welwet coeh?
dickens|Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.
dickens|I gave it as my opinion.
austen|It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting.
austen|Why should there be any change?
dickens|Looking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joes pipe floating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,not obtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared together.
austen|Thank you, said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not another syllable followed.
dickens|It got into shadows on the road, and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up.
austen|In one respect Mrs Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first.
dickens|So!
dickens|He said that this business had, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals, take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long time to come.
dickens|But I could make nothing of the word.
dickens|Joe, how are you, Joe?
austen|To be sure, so it is.
dickens|Tell him to take his witness away directly, said my guardian to the clerk, in extreme disgust, and ask him what he means by bringing such a fellow as that.
austen|Mrs Weston sees no objection to it, provided you are satisfied.
austen|I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar girls in Highbury.
dickens|In silence they go walking up and down together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have brought him to himself.
austen|Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydias connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?
dickens|So you put him in his coffin?
dickens|In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which had been, for many years, built up and forgotten.
dickens|Let us collect them together, in the middle of the cell.
austen|said she, quickly, looking up in his face.
dickens|This is the end of the first stage of Pips expectations.
dickens|In jail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail.
dickens|Nod away at him, Mr Pip; thats what he likes.
austen|I never could comprehend how Mr Weston could part with him.
austen|if you were to see what a headache she has.
dickens|Better leave it alone.
austen|Not one of them had the power of removal, or of effecting any material change of society.
austen|I should like to see Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good.
dickens|Was the woman brought in guilty?
dickens|The stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put his legs up on the settle that he had to himself.
austen|exclaimed Elizabeth, you are too good.
dickens|On the whole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.
dickens|When we gradually fell into keeping late hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about him with a desponding eye at breakfasttime; that he began to look about him more hopefully about midday; that he drooped when he came into dinner; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather clearly, after dinner; that he all but realized Capital towards midnight; and that at about two oclock in the morning, he became so deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to America, with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune.
dickens|Yes, said the Marquis.
austen|I hope he will be calling soon.
austen|Undoubtedly.
austen|Mrs Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.
austen|can it be really so!
austen|I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life.
dickens|Mr Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.
austen|I am a great advocate for timidityand I am sure one does not often meet with it.
austen|In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.
dickens|Three more birthdays of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home.
dickens|Thats true, Mr Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.
dickens|And at the best, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what they are!
dickens|But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of metaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.
austen|Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sisters was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.
dickens|Yes; so they tell me.
dickens|Pray, sir, said I, may I ask you a question?
dickens|Nothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?
dickens|She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, I have been free, I have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!
dickens|We owed so much to Herberts ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often wondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until I was one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude had never been in him at all, but had been in me.
dickens|I have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate.
dickens|I strained my sight upon the sparks that fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed and breathed, match in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the blue point of the match; even those but fitfully.
austen|She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.
austen|His professions and his proposals did him no service.
austen|it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!
austen|Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.
austen|Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?
austen|Oh!
austen|Well, there is feeling here.
austen|Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!
dickens|Citizen Manette, be tranquil.
austen|Emma.
austen|He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion.
austen|Will you read the letter?
austen|Now, he said, he was beginning to have no longer the same wish.
dickens|Forward, my postilions!
austen|Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.
dickens|Now, you are distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from making any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or reference, however distant, to any individual whomsoever as the individual, in all the communications you may have with me.
dickens|Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented.
austen|I have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be seen.
dickens|With this on his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he arrived at the prison of La Force.
dickens|asked the Doctor.
austen|But Mr Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.
austen|Such a blow for Harriet!
austen|I ought not to have said a word about it.
austen|Merely to the illustration of your character, said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity.
austen|Mr Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life!
dickens|Happily it was so quick that I had not put my head out.
dickens|Save him!
austen|I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.
austen|But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happyyour affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.
dickens|said Mr Lorry.
dickens|Mr Pumblechook and Mr Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies society; but Mr Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would.
dickens|Miss Skiffinss brother conducted the negotiation.
austen|cried he, looking eagerly at her, are you, indeed?
austen|My dear Jane!
dickens|I counted up to high numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew in prose and verse.
dickens|He was a long way down the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to stop.
dickens|No favoring in this shop.
austen|She might talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only talk louder, and drown her voice.
austen|You will not see him.
dickens|I sealed my letter, and, not trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.
austen|When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.
dickens|I bred her and educated her, to be loved.
dickens|and resumed.
austen|came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any successno such people had been seen to pass through.
dickens|His breakfasttable was drawn before the fire, and as he sat, with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still, that he might have been sitting for his portrait.
dickens|The family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.
austen|Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative.
dickens|Mr Lorry took it in his hand.
austen|it cannot be.
dickens|Compeysons wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved most dreadful.
dickens|He answered cheerily, Trust to me, dear boy, and sat like a statue.
austen|yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury.
dickens|The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but, stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame Defarges little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.
austen|said she.
dickens|No, I returned, I dont mind admitting that.
dickens|Why, youre at it afore my face!
dickens|You know best, Pip; but dont you think you are happier as you are?
austen|I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs S.
austen|But, my dear, pray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up ones family circle grievously.
dickens|When Miss Havisham done the handsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that were all.
dickens|Well to be sure!
austen|Smiles decked the face of Mrs Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.
dickens|I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at their backs, may have to do some daywork.
dickens|I warnt doing no harm, Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.
austen|And I had plenty all the while in my pocket!
dickens|There was a screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were strained, as if by a weight.
dickens|Did I never give her love!
austen|I can never think of it without laughing.
dickens|Theres others went out alonger me as has done well too, but no man has done nigh as well as me.
austen|What could she possibly mean!
dickens|Hey!
dickens|But if you think as Money can make compensation to me for the loss of the little childwhat come to the forgeand ever the best of friends!
austen|Mr Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.
austen|When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of itof which officers Mr Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeths warm commendation, narrowly observed them both.
austen|When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.
dickens|This is the way to have him!
austen|Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all!
austen|Still, however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment.
austen|It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most countrytown indifference to decorum.
dickens|But, yes, if you like.
austen|But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than on Harrietsmore anxious that she should escape the infection, than that there should be no infection in the complaint.
dickens|Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children, wailing and breadless.
dickens|He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and, resuming it as his safest place, said  Emigrant, my friends!
dickens|those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mothers cheek, as the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it.
dickens|Towards the marshes I now went straight, having no time to spare.
dickens|It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd.
austen|I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected.
austen|She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.
dickens|Have you been to the Grove since?
austen|I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.
austen|Happier than I deserve.
dickens|You and her have pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as getting a easy living in it goes, and Ive took up with new companions, and new masters.
austen|Since her last conversation with Mrs Weston and Mr Knightley, she was more consciencestricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often been.
austen|However, I shall always think it a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.
dickens|There was something so natural and winning in Claras resigned way of looking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; and something so confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner of yielding herself to Herberts embracing arm; and something so gentle in her, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinkss Basin, and the Old Green Copper Ropewalk, with Old Barley growling in the beam,that I would not have undone the engagement between her and Herbert for all the money in the pocketbook I had never opened.
austen|An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.
dickens|What she giv, said Joe, she giv to his friends.
dickens|Then she raised her voice and called out, Citizen Doctor!
austen|Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a parade of insincere professions; and that Mr Knightley certainly had not done him justice.
austen|I wanted to keep it from Janes knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was aware.
austen|Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!
austen|I suspected as much, replied Elizabeth.
austen|But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.
dickens|O yes I shall!
dickens|And now let me take the liberty of asking you a question.
austen|I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk.
dickens|You have a visitor, you see, said Monsieur Defarge.
austen|You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.
austen|Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.
dickens|Yes, I do keep a dog.
dickens|Yes, I know him.
austen|You are very obliging.
dickens|aint it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us?
dickens|Happily I slipped away, and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.
austen|Mr Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body.
dickens|Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen hundreds pass away so.
dickens|But, though she had taken such strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so set upon her, though her influence on my boyish life and character had been allpowerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her with any attributes save those she possessed.
austen|Why does he make it any business of his, to wonder at what I do?
dickens|We dined very well, and were waited on by a maidservant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but who, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole time.
dickens|he asked, in due season.
dickens|So far all goes well with usmuch, much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls.
dickens|On the tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night.
austen|What I said just now, meant nothing.
austen|Very true, very true, indeed.
austen|The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she could not go to church.
dickens|He lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty.
austen|It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.
austen|NoMr Knightley must never marry.
dickens|Am I addressing Mr Pip?
dickens|My thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of Mr and Mrs Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession.
dickens|Theres a charming piece of music by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.
dickens|Hold me, both on youone of each sidedont let her touch me with it.
austen|It struck her with dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world.
austen|It was a long, wellwritten letter, giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision.
dickens|But there are no such decrees yet?
austen|That, from such a quarter, one might expect.
dickens|He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a coach.
austen|A mind like hers, once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress.
dickens|I am going to.
dickens|In the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of tissuepaper that I liked the look of.
dickens|I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far mended as to feel that.
austen|They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere.
austen|thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you.
austen|There was a communication before her, one which she only could be competent to makethe confession of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing to do with it at present.
austen|Did you ever see such dancing?
austen|It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the nextand, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.
austen|She frequently gave me hints of it.
dickens|They both raised their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me.
austen|I have done very little.
austen|A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs Bennets leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying  Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!
austen|You cannot be too much upon your guard.
dickens|The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and deep.
dickens|I had no time for verification, no time for selection, no time for anything, for I had no time to spare.
dickens|In the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face upon his breast.
dickens|It was not for his friend to abate that confidence.
dickens|Wed be puzzled to be more quiet and easygoing than we are at present.
dickens|Here you see me!
austen|He has the promise of an ensigncy in General s regiment, now quartered in the North.
austen|Married women, you know, may be safely authorised.
dickens|For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.
dickens|Mr Darnay, let me ask you a question.
austen|But Mr Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning.
dickens|I knew Mrs Joes housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.
austen|Now was the time for Mr Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion.
dickens|I think so!
austen|I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.
dickens|It had been almost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards very dark.
dickens|The cleared space had been enclosed with a rough fence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had struck root anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin.
dickens|Through his way of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state at once that he was always so zealous and honorable in fulfilling his compact with me, that he made me zealous and honorable in fulfilling mine with him.
austen|I see no occasion for that.
dickens|Why, we are not going fishing!
austen|It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words, not to Mrs Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.
austen|Leave it to me.
dickens|The favour was too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got him!
dickens|Its all very true!
austen|Are you indeed?
austen|Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.
dickens|The new era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils of France, as if the dragons teeth had been sown broadcast, and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olivegrounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the seashore.
dickens|The plain dark dresses, akin to mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days.
dickens|Hah!
dickens|cried Wemmick, I told you so!
dickens|I said Id see to itto tell you the truth.
dickens|Then he placed his breakfast before him with great care, and said, All right, aint you, Aged P.
austen|It is as long again as almost all we have had before.
austen|I have another persons interest at present so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.
austen|Mr Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.
dickens|Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and Wemmick drank out of one glass.
dickens|Thats it, dear boy!
austen|And I certainly never shall give it.
dickens|Not the least.
dickens|Taking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little door at the garden end of it, and walked through.
austen|Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the laugh, it was evident from Janes countenance that she too was really hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.
dickens|No.
dickens|Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed ina common dog, but sword in hand.
dickens|Thats true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes all four round,and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all four round might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of hoofs  I dont mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I dont mean a present.
dickens|You have no business to be incorrigible, was his friends answer, delivered in no very soothing tone.
austen|But I believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor.
austen|It is not now worth a regret, said Emma.
dickens|I think I am quite sure of it.
dickens|asked his son, briskly.
dickens|He wore the white ridingcoat and topboots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair, all untrimmed, hanging loose about him.
austen|There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.
dickens|With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted out in his arms, imploringly, O my dear friend!
dickens|The dismal wind was muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened.
dickens|Dont look out!
austen|Elizabeth was in agonies.
austen|Had you any idea, cried Harriet, of his being in love with her?
austen|He came to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it.
austen|You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.
dickens|Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had disturbed my boyhood,from all those illregulated aspirations that had first made me ashamed of home and Joe,from all those visions that had raised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the anvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden window of the forge, and flit away.
dickens|They were consigned to me, with him, at the He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head.
dickens|He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him.
dickens|For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again, and I felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it.
dickens|Then, a score of others ran into the midst of these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon alive!
dickens|A.
dickens|If anybody, of whatsoever degree, said a word that he didnt approve of, he instantly required to have it taken down.
dickens|There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had brought me down with his invisible gun!
austen|Look at her.
dickens|I noticed that these bonds were all portions of a gentlemans dress.
dickens|I want, she said, to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone.
austen|There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be.
dickens|I am surprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of interference.
dickens|People understood that Tellsons, in a stately way, tolerated the oddjobman.
dickens|We dont know what you have done, but we wouldnt have you starved to death for it, poor miserable fellowcreatur.
austen|If I, said Mr Collins, were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.
austen|About Jane Fairfax.
dickens|Is there danger of another?
austen|If one could but go to Brighton!
dickens|Heavy in figure, movement, and comprehension,in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in the large, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he himself lolled about in a room,he was idle, proud, niggardly, reserved, and suspicious.
dickens|He turned her full to the light, and looked at her.
dickens|said Mr Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on the two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly separated,Oh!
austen|Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.
austen|I assure you mine are very different.
austen|Emma found that it was not Mr Westons fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger.
dickens|If you want a subject, look at Pork!
austen|Mr Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,  Oh!
dickens|Persons bodies, aint it, father?
dickens|Mr Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy returned from the dark room.
dickens|It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my rooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchmans, and leaving him standing at the door, I examined them carefully, including the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep.
dickens|But he said nothing respecting it, and motioned me with a nod into my guardians room.
austen|You should have consulted Perry.
austen|Only one page more.
dickens|He walked up and down, softly repeating their names to himself.
dickens|We have no choice, you and I, but to obey our instructions.
dickens|Thats an excellent card.
dickens|So might you or I be.
dickens|Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herberts compliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the table before me among the stationary, and feel like a Bank of some sort, rather than a private individual.
dickens|As she had never said any word for a long while, I ran and fetched in Mr Gargery from the forge.
dickens|While I described the disaster, Mr Jaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire.
austen|There is nothing like dancing after all.
dickens|The keeper of the wineshop stopped to strike the wall with his hand, and mutter a tremendous curse.
austen|The visit was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one, beyond the nothingmeaning terms of being elegantly dressed, and very pleasing.
austen|and I always thought you meant it.
austen|I dare say my daughter will be here presently, Miss Woodhouse.
austen|Now, Mr Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done.
dickens|The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr Pumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully sensible of that gentlemans merits under arid conditions, as when something moist was going.
austen|mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married today?
dickens|Where are you to live?
dickens|Dont lose your temper, said Joe.
austen|No, said Colonel Fitzwilliam, that is an advantage which he must divide with me.
dickens|Yes.
austen|My charge would be much more concise than hers, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic them.
austen|What could be the meaning of it?
dickens|Perhaps I do, Herbert.
dickens|My dear, said Mr Lorry, striking in to explain; there are frequent risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times, to the end that she may know themthat she may identify them.
austen|There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much.
austen|He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging.
austen|I am sure the service Mr Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of.
austen|Emma, my dear Emma  Oh!
dickens|Such are not my orders.
dickens|He swallowed slowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he looked at me no more.
austen|the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.
austen|They may be induced to go too.
dickens|Mr Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented; but not warmly.
dickens|Remember!
dickens|Pockethandkerchiefs out!
dickens|said Darnay, drawing his arm about her.
austen|It was Miss Taylors loss which first brought grief.
austen|From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr Darcy had been overrated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs Gardiners long letter; but now, having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows  I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write.
dickens|There, there!
dickens|And when were sentenced, aint it him as gets seven year, and me fourteen, and aint it him as the Judge is sorry for, because he might a done so well, and aint it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion, likely to come to worse?
dickens|I do look at you, my dear boy.
dickens|Hed have all he could get.
dickens|Where was Clara?
austen|Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte, and of her voice!
austen|Mrs Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himselfhow much she saw to like in his disposition altogether.
austen|Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.
austen|While she was gone, Mr Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr Woodhouse, who had previously made up his mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of his own civility, to leave Mr Knightley for that purpose.
austen|She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.
dickens|How could it be, then, that I did not like her much the better of the two?
austen|His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time.
dickens|He once yearned so frightfully for that occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach.
dickens|The short, rather plump wife of a starved grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.
dickens|I am not a scholar.
dickens|demanded Wemmick, quite savagely.
austen|Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.
dickens|I had seen none.
dickens|For you do not know that Uncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell, this boys fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havishams, has offered to take him into town tonight in his own chaisecart, and to keep him tonight, and to take him with his own hands to Miss Havishams tomorrow morning.
austen|A gentleman and a stranger!
austen|But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, Is it in address that he improves?
austen|My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.
austen|We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs Churchills temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do.
dickens|Why?
dickens|In the exercise of his skill, the appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all other men.
dickens|I am doubtful, said Mr Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head, about leaving of you, you see.
austen|Mr John Knightleys being a lawyer is very inconvenient.
austen|Where is your sash, my dear?
austen|The pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road, a mile or two beyond Highburyand happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to restore them, he had been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a few minutes he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on foot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them.
dickens|Theres something wrong, said he, without stopping, up at your place, Pip.
dickens|There was none.
austen|If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.
dickens|I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door, said Madame Defarge.
austen|Mr Darcy danced only once with Mrs Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
dickens|He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to dinner.
dickens|He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette did not come back.
dickens|Good morning.
austen|I always fetch the letters when I am here.
austen|It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were accomplished.
dickens|Goodbye, dear Joe!
dickens|Joe!
austen|She was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfaxs letter, and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention.
dickens|I nodded.
dickens|Our relations were business relations, but confidential.
dickens|It was a fresh kind of place, all circumstances considered, where the wind from the river had room to turn itself round; and there were two or three trees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined windmill, and there was the Old Green Copper Ropewalk,whose long and narrow vista I could trace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden frames set in the ground, that looked like superannuated haymakingrakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth.
austen|I do not offer it for Miss Smiths collection, said he.
austen|We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure.
dickens|The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.
dickens|he said.
dickens|By this time, Mr Lorry dared to be pleasant with her, on occasion.
austen|How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year!
austen|If Mr Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not imagine Harriets persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him.
austen|And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they should be of use to us.
dickens|Oh Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!
dickens|And I know Herbert thought so too.
austen|Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment.
dickens|I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool that is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up into your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!
austen|He reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the window seatsbut he reads all them to himself.
dickens|As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.
austen|Mr and Mrs John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield.
dickens|Well, well, well!
austen|that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr Knightley, and was now forming all her views of happiness.
dickens|On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctors table, but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower regions, or in her own room on the second floora blue chamber, to which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance.
dickens|In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly away, I saw a great flaming light spring up.
austen|His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression; and even, when he might have determined not to look, she was confident that he was often listening.
dickens|In the interval, Miss Havisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels from her dressingtable into Estellas hair, and about her bosom and arms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick eyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him, with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it.
austen|Mr Churchill, oh!
dickens|Physician.
austen|You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?
dickens|This is a secret service altogether.
dickens|He stirred his rum and water pointedly at me, and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me.
dickens|And he stirred it and he tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but with a file.
austen|He called her Augusta.
austen|The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.
austen|Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.
austen|Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.
austen|So sudden!
dickens|No one seemed surprised to see him, or interested in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or spoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs, Give way, you!
dickens|Take notice, guard,he tried to murder me, were his first words.
dickens|When her light appeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round and round the room.
dickens|You ARE a scholar.
dickens|Once denounced, and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash his last chance of life.
dickens|Having filled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if his pocket were a drawer.
austen|It was better to pay my visit, then  He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.
dickens|It was a dirty place enough, and I dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good fire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various liquors to drink.
dickens|But she remained before me as plainly as if she were still there.
dickens|And warnt it me as had been tried afore, and as had been knowd up hill and down dale in Bridewells and LockUps!
dickens|There were some marks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been softer and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.
austen|Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demeritssome concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense of justice by Harrietthere would be no need of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr Knightleybut justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now, gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparent kindness.
austen|They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.
austen|Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydias last letter she had prepared her for such a step.
dickens|By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of pudding.
dickens|Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had retired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a conciliatory air, when Mrs Joe darted a look at him, and, when her eyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and exhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs Joe was in a cross temper.
austen|How could I be so silly as to wish it!
dickens|Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille, citizen.
austen|Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.
austen|I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.
austen|At first it was downright dulness to Emma.
austen|I did not wink at you.
dickens|At the back there.
austen|Which of them is it?
dickens|And so quick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn generations,Estellas children, and their children,while the wretchs words were yet on his lips.
austen|Risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.
dickens|The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off his great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones.
dickens|On one of the foremost chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her friend.
austen|It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.
dickens|I encouraged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be consolatory to her.
dickens|You are part of my existence, part of myself.
dickens|That, he returned, is my deliberate opinion in this office.
dickens|And why on the sly?
dickens|Nine gone for ever, ten gone for ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away.
dickens|Which I fully believed it were, Pip, said Joe, slightly tossing his head, though it signify little now, sir.
dickens|In my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated, there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if she were still alive and had been often there.
dickens|On the contrary, said he, I thank you, for though we are strictly in our private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there are Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.
austen|As the sun is out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can.
austen|She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of othersshe objected only to a teteatetethey might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.
dickens|The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent down, and he was very busy.
dickens|You?
dickens|Say Lord strike you dead if you dont!
dickens|Are you known in London?
austen|No indeed I have not.
austen|She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.
dickens|Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick.
austen|You were Mr Bingleys first choice.
austen|Certainly; you must be sensible that the last halfyear has made a great difference in your way of life.
dickens|Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy today and somebody else tomorrow; she would have derived only pain, and no pleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her own breast than mine.
austen|When he did return, he sought out the child and took notice of her.
dickens|Hush!
dickens|I had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little I possessed was adapted to my new station.
dickens|What proof had he of this?
austen|How much more must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and foresight!
austen|I was sixteen years old when you were born.
dickens|I make response, Tall as a spectre.
austen|No governess!
austen|Her character appeared absolutely changed.
dickens|Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light to be in a window of a publichouse.
dickens|It was almost morning, when Defarges wineshop parted with its last knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife, in husky tones, while fastening the door  At last it is come, my dear!
dickens|It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest necessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my account from the coffeehouse or somewhere else.
dickens|The murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it swells forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away.
austen|He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer, for the fears of Mr Woodhouse had confined them to a footpace.
dickens|After three days delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over for the production of the witness from the prisonship, the witness came, and completed the easy case.
dickens|It would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.
austen|Mr Dixon, you say, is not, strictly speaking, handsome?
dickens|It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I very well knew why he had come there.
dickens|Some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think.
dickens|As to our table, you wont find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied from our coffeehouse here, and it is only right I should add at your expense, such being Mr Jaggerss directions.
austen|She did not choose it, said her daughter, she would go.
dickens|His name is Mr Barley.
dickens|Do you ask, Citizen Doctor?
austen|But a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every other he is below it.
austen|You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.
dickens|And I got up, determined to have my share of it.
dickens|said the stranger, Ill help you.
austen|About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.
dickens|I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and from her to me.
dickens|Call assistance!
dickens|Very well, very well.
austen|One says those sort of things, of course, without any idea of a serious meaning.
dickens|and also, Is that Black Bill behind the cistern?
dickens|Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night, the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr Lorrys attention.
dickens|Courage!
dickens|The nature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms of familiarity without placing me on terms of favor, conduced to my distraction.
austen|Jamess?
dickens|As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting smile.
dickens|Who is she?
austen|Miss Bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by Carolines not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.
dickens|All here, yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street, sitting beside the Queen.
austen|My fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it.
austen|She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr Darcys character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.
dickens|Such a thing has happened here, often, and too often.
dickens|It opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the neglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbagestalks, and one boxtree that had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new growth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different color, as if that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt.
austen|cried Emma, not attending to her.
dickens|Out of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost it again.
dickens|From these decayed sons and daughters of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress, or Cinderellas Godmother who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit, a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she pleased.
austen|The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes, when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the Oh!
dickens|The same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every inch of his road.
austen|It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up.
dickens|We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts and oranges and apples to the parlor; which was a change very like Joes change from his workingclothes to his Sunday dress.
austen|What a fine thing for our girls!
dickens|You speak like a Frenchman.
austen|Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr Bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
austen|They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it.
dickens|Such a Barber!
austen|She is very timid and silent.
dickens|Herbert said from behind at the same time poking me, Capitally.
dickens|One brings another, you see; thats the way of it.
dickens|A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his eyes on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had seen some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was a little child.
austen|He was thoughtful.
austen|If we exert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of allies.
dickens|The Doctor looked at him for a momenthalf inquiringly, half as if he were angry at being spoken toand bent over his work again.
austen|You know I have.
austen|And what is fifty miles of good road?
austen|I must make myself very disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend.
austen|He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.
dickens|You can scarcely realize to yourself the hatred those people feel for you.
austen|No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called.
austen|He was gone the next momentafter another moments pause,  Take it, said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards Harrietit is for you.
austen|How the delicacy, the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep!
austen|Mr Elton made his appearance.
austen|A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it, where there is no doubt of her regard, must, I think, be the happiest of mortals.
dickens|Why, dont you know, said Mr Pumblechook, testily, that when I have been there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and the door has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way.
dickens|Two one pound notes, or friends?
austen|Mrs Bates, Mrs Perry, Mrs Goddard and others, were a good deal behindhand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged.
austen|And left a name behind her that would not soon die away.
austen|I am sure of your kind support and aid.
austen|The gentlemen spoke of his horse.
dickens|Thats good comfort.
austen|Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.
dickens|He was delivered to you.
austen|Not at all, was her answer; but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.
austen|Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart.
dickens|It was ten oclock at night before we ventured to creep in again, and then she asked Joe why he hadnt married a Negress Slave at once?
austen|She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbells return.
austen|But I wonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.
dickens|No, no, Pip!
dickens|For his sake, Doctor, she said, pointing to him in tears, I would do all I can to make what poor amends I can.
dickens|I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth like a fire.
dickens|Where is my bench?
dickens|So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves of the planetree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him.
dickens|Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds down, and engaged for sundry other payments some, to fall due at certain dates out of my income some, contingent on my coming into my property.
dickens|Which it were, said Joe, that how you might be amongst strangers, and that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a moment might not prove unacceptabobble.
austen|Heaven forbid!
austen|I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure you.
austen|Why any fear of detection?
austen|The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward to another happy resultthe cure of Harriets infatuation.
austen|Shocking plan, living together.
dickens|I was looking at the two, when there came between me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.
dickens|Thus, with beerdrinking, pipesmoking, songroaring, and infinite caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it.
dickens|Then I think I wouldnt, if I was you.
dickens|equally like smoke, if not more so.
austen|He was immediately interested.
dickens|At last his father disinherited him; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though not nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.
austen|Dancing with open windows!
dickens|The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he spoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven.
austen|Knightley!
dickens|Any time mentioned?
dickens|I asked him then, Which of the two do you suppose you saw?
dickens|We had a doleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitchs side, I felt that that was my place henceforth while he lived.
dickens|I am going, she said again, in a gentler voice, to be married to him.
austen|In the first place, replied Mr Gardiner, there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.
dickens|A stony business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in all directions.
dickens|You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?
austen|Harriets cheerful look and manner established hers she came back, not to think of Mr Martin, but to talk of Mr Elton.
austen|Now I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you.
austen|Oh!
dickens|You can bear a little more light?
austen|I should like it beyond anything!
dickens|I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted the Ageds sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.
dickens|What of Charles?
austen|Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.
dickens|For all these reasons I told Wemmick, and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a great affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmicks experience and knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my resources to help Herbert to some present income,say of a hundred a year, to keep him in good hope and heart,and gradually to buy him on to some small partnership.
austen|Mrs Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.
austen|No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.
dickens|Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind.
austen|I know what you meanbut Emmas hand is the strongest.
dickens|Mr Lorrys eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late, and his tears fell.
austen|You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible.
austen|Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline.
dickens|Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I felt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as I understood the fact myself.
dickens|I did intend to ask you to use any little opportunities you might have after I was gone, of improving dear Joe.
dickens|But when they advance quite near to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me.
austen|Many vain solicitudes would be preventedmany awkwardnesses smoothed by it.
austen|Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all doing?
dickens|said she.
dickens|If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not.
austen|His mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry.
dickens|Neither of them for a single moment released the others eyes.
austen|It had no advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes.
dickens|Have no fear!
dickens|Monseigneur.
austen|Yes, very different.
austen|No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk.
dickens|Perfectly so, madame, replied the spy.
dickens|I will not be interfered with by Jane, said Mrs Pocket, with a majestic glance at that innocent little offender.
dickens|The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School, said Stryver, nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, the old seesaw Sydney.
dickens|I follow you, sir.
dickens|And when Jarvis Lorry saw the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.
austen|And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.
dickens|croaked the man with the craving.
austen|She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
dickens|Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events, attributable to some influence of minethis is what I mean, if I can make it plaincan I use no influence to serve you?
dickens|I dont mean to imply that he wont, said I, but it might make you hold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.
dickens|Soon, Madame Defarges hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled waist.
austen|You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.
dickens|Next day, sir, said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off, having cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A.
austen|But she had believed them to be wellmeaning, worthy people before; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion?
dickens|Upon that, he pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clew without which he couldnt find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the establishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror quite a superfluous article, considering the holes proportions, an anchovy saucecruet, and somebodys pattens.
austen|Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriets mind, Emma would have been amused by its variations.
austen|Mrs Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.
dickens|The swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on.
austen|Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
dickens|They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the child, by a bright fire.
austen|It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of following his duty, instead of consulting expediency.
austen|But I had no choice.
dickens|Tracing it to its source, he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on Mr Crunchers head.
austen|Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?
austen|Such a debasement on his!
austen|Isabella and Emma both write beautifully, said Mr Woodhouse; and always did.
dickens|Saint Antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper, seized himwould have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear Foulon companyset his head and heart on pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolfprocession through the streets.
dickens|He was prematurely bald on the top of his head, and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldnt lie down but stood up bristling.
austen|She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
austen|I think you said she was a widow, sir?
austen|said Emma, highly amused.
austen|That would be the greatest misfortune of all!
austen|Only let me be told when I may speak out.
austen|If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more.
austen|It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life.
dickens|The escort were so wretchedly clothed, that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off.
dickens|On the road I have suffered a great deal.
dickens|I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and byandbye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.
dickens|So, Herbert, looking at me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis immediately shaking hands with him, said, Now youre on your oath, you know.
austen|And so you like this mans sisters, too, do you?
dickens|He took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table.
dickens|And I shall often think of that with peace, when I wake up in the night.
austen|What do you keep winking at me for?
dickens|Dead!
dickens|I say, Mr Pip!
dickens|Whether you scold me or approve of me, returned poor Biddy, you may equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here, at all times.
austen|Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.
dickens|His face is bleeding and covered with dust, but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again.
dickens|It was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for, but he took up a knife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, And what I done is worked out and paid for!
austen|If attention, in future, could do away the past, she might hope to be forgiven.
austen|He ought to come, said Emma.
dickens|You see I am informed of the circumstances?
austen|In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.
dickens|Next day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise to go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe or his name.
dickens|Both Mr Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and in favour of one of them remaining.
austen|To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret to judge us all!
austen|You do it very ill.
austen|She believed he was very clever, and understood every thing.
austen|When the cardtables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.
dickens|Be comforted!
austen|She was, besides, which was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious!
dickens|I still lay there.
austen|It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.
dickens|Do you want to be the death of me?
dickens|Pardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoethe drag.
austen|But this was not judged feasible.
dickens|Can the candle help it?
dickens|Send other women up and down to seek her, lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far enough to find her!
austen|of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.
dickens|I stole some bread, some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat which I tied up in my pockethandkerchief with my last nights slice, some brandy from a stone bottle which I decanted into a glass bottle I had secretly used for making that intoxicating fluid, Spanishliquoricewater, up in my room diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard, a meat bone with very little on it, and a beautiful round compact pork pie.
austen|Indeed, I could not.
austen|The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion.
austen|replied Mrs Weston, smiling, what is the certainty of caprice?
dickens|One of her sisterhood knitted beside her.
dickens|You did that, and that would be enough, without more.
dickens|Ever live by play?
austen|Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen her.
dickens|But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellsons.
dickens|Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt that I was dusty with the dust of smallcoal, and that I had a weight upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather.
dickens|I knew it from himself.
austen|Did not you observe her manner of answering me?
austen|Though Lydias short letter to Mrs F.
austen|Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr Bingleys carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.
austen|Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
dickens|They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed.
austen|The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or talkingstrawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or spoken of.
austen|I remember once calling you George, in one of my amiable fits, about ten years ago.
austen|it is no difficulty to see who you take after!
dickens|But, it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr Lorry; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got upstairs, Mr Lorry was reminded of Defarge the wineshop keeper, and the starlight ride.
austen|She played and sang;and drew in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command, and ought not to have failed of.
austen|You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.
dickens|What spirit was that?
austen|You must and shall be married by a special licence.
austen|Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it.
austen|And for this we are to be thankful.
austen|The touch seemed immediate.
austen|Mrs Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months.
dickens|I walked no further than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be weaker than I was, and asked Joe for his arm.
dickens|He was the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages, and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and put them on again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful for.
dickens|It was the elder who replied, Since about this hour last night.
dickens|Two or three months at most.
austen|Their powers of conversation were considerable.
austen|Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.
dickens|An unnatural silence and desertion reigned there.
dickens|Has been here some daysthree or fourI dont know how manyI cant collect my thoughts.
austen|I must order the carriage.
dickens|I am well prepared, but there are precautions to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the Tribunal.
dickens|Very tall and dark, I told him.
austen|But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.
austen|The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from Londonhis five sisters and a cousin.
dickens|And how much money is wanting to complete the purchase?
dickens|So oppressed, tooas you say.
austen|Elizabeth could bear it no longer.
dickens|The blueflies buzzed again, and Mr AttorneyGeneral called Mr Jarvis Lorry.
austen|Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylors judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.
austen|I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.
dickens|Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in treacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?
dickens|Once, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.
austen|These are heavy misfortunes, replied Elizabeth.
austen|She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.
dickens|Put your question.
dickens|You remember his breaking off here about some woman that he had had great trouble with.
dickens|Nine hundred pounds.
dickens|Mr Pocket, Juniors, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly maddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the window, before I heard footsteps on the stairs.
austen|If Miss Taylor undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.
dickens|Dear Pip, said Biddy, you are sure you dont fret for her?
austen|But it is his gratitude on Harriets account.
austen|If you mean Darcy, cried her brother, he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it beginsbut as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards.
dickens|Come, once again.
austen|She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing.
dickens|So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.
austen|Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first surmises.
austen|Mr Bingley does not know Mr Wickham himself?
dickens|In the Doctors little household, as in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small shops.
dickens|When the rain came with it and dashed against the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they rocked, that I might have fancied myself in a stormbeaten lighthouse.
dickens|They had all dropped off.
dickens|that the youths earliest patron, companion, and friend, was a highly respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed trade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises are situate within a hundred miles of the High Street.
dickens|Roar and roar.
dickens|Give me, said Joe, a good book, or a good newspaper, and sit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better.
dickens|Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men, Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the letter, and read it.
dickens|The strange man, after glancing at Joe, and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again when I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his legin a very odd way, as it struck me.
dickens|If you say a word to me, Ill throw up the case.
dickens|piped the old man from within.
dickens|You cold, cold heart!
dickens|How do you do?
dickens|Then Joe began to hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.
dickens|Heaven knows we dont, returned Miss Pross, but have no fear for me.
austen|She wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of Mr Darcys house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.
dickens|Nevertheless, a hackneycoachman, who seemed to have as many capes to his greasy greatcoat as he was years old, packed me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles.
austen|Bless me!
austen|Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.
austen|such delicacy!
austen|Emmas confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to declare her affection engaged.
austen|The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.
dickens|It is quite true, she replied, referring to him with the indifference of utter contempt.
dickens|By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr Pocket had been educated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished himself; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs Pocket very early in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a Grinder.
dickens|Then, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and said in a whisper,  Is she beautiful, graceful, wellgrown?
austen|I am perfectly comfortable today.
austen|Now I am secure of you for ever.
dickens|You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is Compeyson?
dickens|Dont be nettled, Mr Lorry.
austen|But Mr Elton, in person, had driven away all such cares.
austen|I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfaxs mind over Mrs Elton.
austen|It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.
dickens|Mr Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out, now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry who, in the slackened interest, could easily get near him.
dickens|It had no set beginning, as Dear Mr Pip, or Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or Dear Anything, but ran thus  I am to come to London the day after tomorrow by the midday coach.
austen|You are very ill.
dickens|he asked, as the result of that conference.
austen|And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr Darcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William  Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.
dickens|This man pursued Miss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her.
austen|cried his wife impatiently.
austen|She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to lace up her boot, without recollecting.
austen|More and more frightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking out her purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more, or to use her ill.
dickens|And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand as a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded into a partner.
austen|why did she come?
austen|he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his life.
austen|Miss Woodhouse, why are you always so right?
austen|I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.
austen|Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her life.
dickens|Hell be eightytwo next birthday.
austen|They found Mr Bennet still up.
dickens|As if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr Lorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.
dickens|Then you dont?
dickens|A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.
austen|My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the diningroom.
austen|A water party; and by some accident she was falling overboard.
dickens|The only remark I ever heard him make on your story, was the final one, The thing is settled and done, or Mr Jaggers would not be in it.
austen|And when, thought Emma, will there be a beginning of Mr Churchill?
dickens|Yes, old chap.
dickens|He came of rich people down in Somersetshire, who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead.
austen|no.
dickens|Is he here?
austen|He looked at her with a glow of regard.
austen|She had seen only Mrs Martin and the two girls.
dickens|for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she had momentarily darkened with her hand; such a cruel, bad sight.
dickens|Mr Pumblechook partook of pudding.
dickens|replied Biddy.
dickens|On my presenting myself at Mrs Brandleys, Estellas maid was called to tell that Estella had gone into the country.
dickens|As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of business, he said, when they had got back to the drawingroom and had sat down there in friendly relations, let me ask youdoes the Doctor, in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?
austen|A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago.
dickens|said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know.
austen|If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur something.
austen|The letter was to this effect  MY DEAR LIZZY,  I wish you joy.
dickens|Soon forgotten!
dickens|Not only would the echoes die away, as though the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand.
austen|You do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations.
dickens|You are to understand, first, that it is the request of the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear the name of Pip.
dickens|They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened.
austen|To work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.
austen|I mean of late.
dickens|It was violently swollen and inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched.
austen|I should not have used the expression.
austen|I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town.
dickens|Its only to be hoped, said my sister, that he wont be Pompeyed.
dickens|In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his bench and to work.
austen|If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.
dickens|inquired Madame Defarge, letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.
austen|It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.
dickens|said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool business air.
dickens|To me, women!
dickens|Miss Sarah, said Joe, she have twentyfive pound perannium fur to buy pills, on account of being bilious.
dickens|But not quite, for they never did it.
dickens|I might have known that he would never help me out; but it took me aback to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new.
dickens|To me, parting is a painful thing.
dickens|Dissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is possible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied with myself.
austen|I remember she said she was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind!
dickens|When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady.
dickens|After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked Mr Jaggers if I could send for a coach?
austen|You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here.
austen|I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument at her grandmothers, it must have been a real indulgence.
dickens|And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed to shape itself into a purpose, Mr Barsad.
austen|Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
dickens|And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and the world lay spread before me.
dickens|To the Guillotine all aristocrats!
dickens|Who dye live with,supposin youre kindly let to live, which I hant made up my mind about?
dickens|said Stryver, staring at him, am I not eligible?
austen|Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?
austen|But when she read and reread with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.
austen|The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.
austen|Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.
austen|So kind of her to think of my mother!
dickens|I should not have told her No, if I had been you, said Mr Jaggers; but every man ought to know his own business best.
dickens|When we parted, I presented him with two guineas which seemed to meet his views, and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of him which made no impression on him at all.
austen|We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party.
austen|I knew that Mr Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon settledhe resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.
dickens|Day after day, a vast heavy veil had been driving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in the East there were an Eternity of cloud and wind.
dickens|That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent contriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table; and, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I played at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company, or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared to contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair beside him to illustrate his remarks.
dickens|Anything else?
austen|He is a sweettempered, amiable, charming man.
austen|He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former.
dickens|Mr Pumblechook not improved in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure was waiting for me, and addressed me in the following terms  Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low.
austen|And so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed!
austen|Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr Stone.
austen|He met her at the parlourdoor, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,  Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?
dickens|Been bolting his food, has he?
austen|Harriet may pick and chuse.
austen|What will you say, Emmawhat will any body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged;nay, that they have been long engaged!
austen|But really, maam, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.
austen|My aunts intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.
dickens|Rheumatic too.
austen|Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.
dickens|My wife did, at the very moment when you came in.
dickens|cried her brother, interrupting.
austen|I could hardly keep my countenance.
austen|Mrs Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.
austen|Do not you remember, Mrs Weston, employing him to write for you one day?
austen|and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs Weston, on that score.
austen|We shall soon overtake her.
austen|Jane, Jane, look!
austen|cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.
dickens|Gentlemen, said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her, good day.
austen|Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,  said Miss Bates, four weeks yesterday.
austen|Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging.
dickens|Oh!
dickens|Miss Havisham sent for me, sir, I explained.
dickens|He had come back, to save a citizens life, and to bear his testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth.
dickens|You would never marry him, Estella?
dickens|However, I got dressed, darkly wiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, Can I help you?
austen|the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.
austen|They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.
dickens|Nine days and nights.
dickens|At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs Pockets handkerchief, and said, If that dont make six times youve dropped it, Mum!
dickens|Do you seek any promise from me?
dickens|He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes.
austen|Do not you think so?
dickens|This is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year.
dickens|Blest if I know that either, said Jerry.
dickens|Before our peoples time here, sir.
dickens|And the makers name?
dickens|Where?
dickens|Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs.
austen|When you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for.
dickens|At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife, when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be dimmed.
austen|My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done!
austen|It was greatly my wish that he should do so, he added, as soon as his marriage was fixed on.
dickens|It gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long afterwards.
austen|He was not hungry; it would only make him hotter.
austen|As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend in better hands.
austen|But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.
dickens|What was my indignant surprise when he called upon the company to pledge him to Estella!
dickens|I am an official.
austen|Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my fathers behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.
austen|We shall never agree about him, cried Emma; but that is nothing extraordinary.
dickens|Why!
austen|Not that it was such a very old petticoat eitherfor still it would last a great whileand, indeed, she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.
austen|He is generally thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy.
austen|Such a host of friends!
austen|The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.
dickens|It is I, Pip.
dickens|Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed aside, and fell down over her neck.
dickens|said Wemmick.
dickens|Hard by was a small stonequarry.
dickens|This is him untoe the sister of which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana Mria from her own mother, let him deny it if he can!
dickens|What are you worth!
austen|Why will you think so?
austen|If I were to marry, I must expect to repent it.
dickens|Since I must say so, I know it.
austen|I honestly said as much to Mr E.
austen|She was in no hurry at all.
austen|their luxury and ease.
dickens|They aint worth much, then.
dickens|Then dont think of me, retorted Miss Havisham.
austen|Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she was too much beloved to be parted with.
dickens|said the offhand sergeant, as its on his Majestys service.
austen|It was the last of the regiments stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.
dickens|And all I can say of it is, laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, that thisha, ha!
austen|She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.
dickens|I know that your intentions are evil, said Miss Pross, and you may depend upon it, Ill hold my own against them.
dickens|Yes, sir, said I; him too; late of this parish.
austen|Such doings discomposed Mr Bennet exceedingly.
dickens|When I had spoken to Biddy, as I thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and there began to wonder in what part of the house itshemy sisterwas.
dickens|Would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop?
dickens|It is possible, said the uncle, with great calmness.
dickens|They shook hands again, and as we walked away Wemmick said to me, A Coiner, a very good workman.
austen|, I often say, rather you than I.
austen|May is the very month which Mrs Churchill is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than Enscombein short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole springprecisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it days almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise.
dickens|I was ashamed to answer him.
dickens|If you hear in my voiceI dont know that it is so, but I hope it isif you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it!
austen|The officers will find women better worth their notice.
dickens|The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial friend, in the morning stillness.
austen|You have shown him off now much more than he did himself.
austen|But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles.
austen|But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other.
dickens|He accompanied his conductor into a guardroom, smelling of common wine and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake, drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about.
dickens|The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would have had more if it were possible.
dickens|His back was towards me, and he had his arms folded, and was nodding forward, heavy with sleep.
austen|What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!
dickens|And I added, I would gladly try that gentleman.
dickens|If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face.
dickens|On my way yonder, said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot, where they reserve my chair and my knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing.
dickens|What are you staring at?
dickens|It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge.
austen|And to this day, I do believe, she knows not whether it was his present or his daughters.
dickens|But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to me?
austen|Such an extraordinary dream of mine!
dickens|When the foremost billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these mena man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his handseparated him from the rest, and got him between himself and the wall.
dickens|He walked by the stream, far from the houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank.
austen|Under a bright midday sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of this alfresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was happily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.
austen|Emma watched them in, and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,trying, with all the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern.
dickens|and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited experience.
dickens|So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to me.
austen|Their affection was always to subside into friendship.
dickens|All this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I went, I couldnt warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted, as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet.
dickens|As we were close to Camilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss Havisham wouldnt stop.
austen|But the wife of Mr Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.
dickens|But dont loiter, boy.
dickens|My credentials, entries, and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, Recalled to Life; which may mean anything.
austen|She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr Elton should close it.
dickens|Frequently?
dickens|Look at me.
austen|They could go there again with them in the autumn.
austen|Ah!
austen|Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin?
dickens|Good day, Jacques!
austen|Harriet had business at Fords.
dickens|Towards the last, I could understand some few syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips.
dickens|says the chief of that company, pointing to the village, bring him fast to his tomb!
dickens|Can I separate my fathers twinbrother, joint inheritor, and next successor, from himself?
dickens|Joe greeted me as usual with Halloa, Pip, old chap!
austen|She will not be able to help calling.
dickens|The gentleman from Tellsons had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manettes apartment.
dickens|What I stand to, is, that he knows well wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin.
dickens|cried Miss Pross.
austen|I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.
austen|It led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an approach to the house, which never had been there.
dickens|Next day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and he put them on.
dickens|They stared again.
dickens|In this progress I was much annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband, and smoothing my cloak.
dickens|Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?
dickens|But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how identified he is with his soninlaw.
dickens|I thought Mr Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool for his disinterestedness.
austen|This information, however, startled Mrs Bennet; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.
austen|I guessed as much.
dickens|As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr Lorry wanted, by saying to him with a frown, Witness at that trial.
dickens|I feel a particular interest in being acquainted with it.
austen|One mans style must not be the rule of anothers.
austen|Now I am quite happy, said she, for you will be as happy as myself.
austen|I really do not think there will.
dickens|It was hard by the fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.
austen|She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times.
dickens|These were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied myself to my education.
dickens|said he, I didnt care much for it.
dickens|asked Madame Defarge, with a lowering smile.
austen|Mr Perry did say so.
austen|He was thinking.
austen|Mr Weston and Mrs Elton led the way, Mr Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed.
dickens|You know that I have loved you long and dearly.
austen|The situation of your mothers family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father.
dickens|I believe, said Mr Lorry, rather halting in his reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more, I state the case, Citizen Defarge?
dickens|Mr Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing both ceremonies very slowly.
dickens|What!
austen|It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the ladys family, it would be an unpleasant thing.
dickens|The kennel, to make amends, ran down the middle of the streetwhen it ran at all which was only after heavy rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses.
dickens|he exclaimed.
dickens|Give it me back, Mum, said Flopson; and Miss Jane, come and dance to baby, do!
dickens|Bring me hither that fellow!
dickens|Dont you know?
austen|But the question is not, whether it would be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think he does.
austen|for, not being within when he called the other day, I had never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr E.
dickens|Sydney Carton drank nothing but a little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh himself, went out to the place of trial.
dickens|Our lights warmed the air about us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets.
austen|She must have delighted the Colesworthy people, who deserved to be made happy!
dickens|At another time, sir, he returned, evasively, the present time is illconwenient for explainin.
austen|A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest Goodbye, closed the speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill.
dickens|You had better be apprenticed at once.
dickens|Again Mr Cruncher nodded his head.
austen|Whenever I see her, she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.
austen|Mr Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshirepaid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.
dickens|But when I heard the Sunday bells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I felt that I was not nearly thankful enough,that I was too weak yet to be even that,and I laid my head on Joes shoulder, as I had laid it long ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too much for my young senses.
austen|My representation, you see, has quite appeased her.
dickens|As I passed the church, I felt as I had felt during service in the morning a sublime compassion for the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after Sunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the low green mounds.
dickens|Wonderful!
austen|This is delightful, is not it?
austen|Marks Place, Venice, when Frank Churchill entered the room.
austen|Now, said Harriet, you must recollect.
austen|Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs Bennet.
dickens|Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded.
dickens|While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair, the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived from like sources.
dickens|he would generally say at those times, and would briskly fall to his sawing again.
dickens|Thus I made the second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.
austen|Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr Darcy.
dickens|With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on depth, and overflowed the city to that point.
dickens|Now, said Herbert, as it was succeeded by silence, hes drinking.
austen|Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things I know are all chance in this world.
austen|This was the amount of the whole story,of his communication and of Harriets as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.
austen|I thought it must be so.
dickens|I am not quite clear whether these articles were carried penitentially or ostentatiously; but I rather think they were displayed as articles of property,much as Cleopatra or any other sovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or procession.
dickens|Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of most other sauce to wretched bread.
austen|Believe her to be deceived, by all means.
dickens|And may Imay I?
austen|Had not my feelings decided against youhad they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?
austen|The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice  Are you pleased with Kent?
austen|How well she looked last night!
dickens|Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bulldog, or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master.
dickens|The resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering one vain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, and struggled with all my might.
austen|One cannot have too large a party.
dickens|After long and lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night, circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn up together singing a Liberty song.
dickens|Now, wolf, said he, afore I kill you like any other beast,which is wot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,Ill have a good look at you and a good goad at you.
dickens|cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to rise from her legs to her bosom.
dickens|By and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.
austen|It depends upon the character of those who handle it.
dickens|They passed by under the window, looking at nothing else, and they did not go down to the landingplace which I could discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction of the Nore.
austen|My poor dear Harriet!
dickens|said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery.
austen|The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriets mind was not to be talked away.
austen|I do not wonder at you.
austen|No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village.
austen|Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others.
austen|Lady Catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts.
austen|cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.
austen|It has been completely unexpected.
austen|They are goodnatured people, and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel that any bodys hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss Woodhouses doing it would be more thought of than any other persons in the room.
austen|Other schemes, too, came into her head.
dickens|I had seen the damp lying on the outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there all night, and using the window for a pockethandkerchief.
dickens|Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the old, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking out, by asserting his power over her in the old way.
austen|Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr Dixon, I meanI do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addressesand as Jane used to be very often walking out with themfor Colonel and Mrs Campbell were very particular about their daughters not walking out often with only Mr Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he had taken himself.
austen|She felt anew the justice of Mr Darcys objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.
dickens|Mr Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.
austen|Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.
austen|If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go.
dickens|I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I love very dearly.
dickens|Write on; there are but a few words more.
dickens|La Force!
austen|Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr Darcys steward.
austen|I shall try for it with a zeal!
austen|While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surpriseall astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible.
dickens|Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or are we to divide them among us?
dickens|English.
austen|You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than good to them, by interference.
austen|Harriet Smiths intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing.
dickens|I knew the limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles apart; so that, if a light had been burning at each point that night, there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright specks.
dickens|What remained for me now, but to follow him to the dear old forge, and there to have out my disclosure to him, and my penitent remonstrance with him, and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved Secondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts, and had formed into a settled purpose?
dickens|In the days when all these things are to be answered for, I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them separately.
austen|It was all my doing, I know.
dickens|said she, laughing, after a moment, perhaps.
austen|Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr Bingleys regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.
dickens|Well, but Ill answer you.
dickens|That I should innocently take a bad halfcrown of somebody elses manufacture is reasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin of my own make as good money!
dickens|It is a ladys shoe.
dickens|Lucie and I have been there; but only casually.
dickens|Which is he?
dickens|I made some attempt to get up and dress myself.
dickens|I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.
dickens|I saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I used often to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics, fête days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures, through which I pursued her,and they were all miseries to me.
austen|My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any benefit; and Mr Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you, does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.
dickens|The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had stood,for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, in one unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with his pipe and his negrohead and his jackknife and his pack of cards, and what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate,I say his chair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but next moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another.
austen|I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.
dickens|I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street.
austen|Why he should feel such a scruple, why he should change his mind when it was all but done, she could not perceive.
dickens|The worst of the strife was over.
austen|for better, for worse.
austen|My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.
dickens|I was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby, which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs Pocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs Pocket, baby and all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.
dickens|It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert, for that evening.
austen|I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult.
dickens|I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her and keep her down, and looked into her face.
dickens|What was it?
dickens|My father, said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.
dickens|I think I would have gone through a great deal to kiss her cheek.
austen|Oh!
dickens|Well; he may be.
austen|But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.
austen|She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the Abbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her again so soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future.
austen|It is such enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.
austen|He caught her.
austen|If Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.
austen|I am so grieved for him!
dickens|Not directly profitable.
austen|Emma, said she, this paper is worse than I expected.
dickens|There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman.
dickens|The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the drinkingtable, while the jackal sat at his own paperbestrewn table proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to his hand.
dickens|And then they began to fish.
austen|It is no such thing.
dickens|We have seen nothing else, returned The Vengeance.
austen|Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration; she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.
dickens|This is a fine place of my sons, sir, cried the old man, while I nodded as hard as I possibly could.
austen|She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours.
austen|Of whom does Jane ever think ill?
austen|I have a note of his.
dickens|A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me.
dickens|Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this conversation by so much as a passing word.
austen|The public pays and must be served well.
austen|and Knightley have every thing their own way.
dickens|Lookee here, old chap, said Joe.
austen|It may perhaps be pleasant, replied Charlotte, to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.
dickens|You follow me?
dickens|we saw the man, who was supposed to be at the gate, standing silent behind him.
dickens|If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden in mine,which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason to suspect myself of having been a monstrosity,it is the key to many reservations.
dickens|In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been addressed to her by the same post.
austen|Oh!
austen|said he quietly, and looking at her; of what nature?
austen|If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.
dickens|There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.
austen|He is as fine a fellow, said Mr Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, as ever I saw.
dickens|It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away.
austen|Difference!
dickens|I know more of the history of Miss Havishams adopted child than Miss Havisham herself does, sir.
dickens|Not very much.
dickens|I have been speaking to Mrs Hubble, and I am going to her tomorrow.
dickens|When we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and get over a stile near a sluicegate.
dickens|To Soho?
austen|I had known the Campbells a little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.
austen|It was a very extraordinary thing!
dickens|Soho!
dickens|Nothing but beggar my neighbor, miss.
dickens|There was an expression of contempt on his face, and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he watched the group of faces.
austen|Her feelings altered towards Emma.
dickens|As it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort myself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and solitude before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would afterwards go to the play.
dickens|And I was so miserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on my back, afore I could get Jaggers.
dickens|Oh!
dickens|The marriage was to make no change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it, by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.
dickens|Consequently, another drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord and the coffeeroom, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to his breakfast.
austen|It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr Woodhouse for some time.
dickens|I believe it is something of that sort, said Mr Cruncher.
austen|I never thought Mr Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do.
dickens|It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and fearful storm.
austen|They will stay a good while when they do come, and he will be half his time with us.
dickens|Are we ready?
austen|and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see Miss Taylor here!
austen|and to see dear Wickham too!
dickens|It was directed to Philip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the words, PLEASE READ THIS, HERE.
dickens|I didnt ask him if he was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly established.
dickens|Joe gave me some more gravy.
dickens|The officer always gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some other sick prisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses, malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be thanked!
austen|Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.
dickens|Not with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no; with considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of incongruity.
austen|In the way of love, I am sure he does not.
dickens|And if it was a toastingfork, youd go into brass and do yourself no credit.
dickens|We got aboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer.
austen|The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.
dickens|But you are not English, said the woodsawyer, though you wear English dress?
dickens|You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?
dickens|Provis, regarding him with a fixed attention, was slowly putting up his jackknife, and groping in another pocket for something else.
dickens|When she had exhausted a torrent of such inquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud sobbing, got out the dustpan,which was always a very bad sign,put on her coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent.
dickens|I liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it.
dickens|Then you are?
dickens|I bring you a request from her.
dickens|said the wineshop keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it.
austen|I am quite glad to see you.
austen|This little explanation with Mr Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure.
dickens|and ran away.
dickens|As a man of business, I am not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of business, I know nothing of it.
dickens|IWere you going there now?
austen|Skilful has been the hand!
austen|You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.
dickens|It was not another of the dreams in which he had often come back; he was really here.
dickens|Thats Bentley Drummle, I replied; the one with the delicate face is Startop.
austen|Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form as well as quantity.
austen|Lydias being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.
dickens|Her husband saw her so she learned from her father it might be once in five or six times it might be twice or thrice running it might be, not for a week or a fortnight together.
dickens|and a thousand answering shouts.
austen|He keeps a manservant, does he?
dickens|There is some wisits praps, said Joe, as for ever remains open to the question, Pip.
austen|The backgammontable was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary.
dickens|and I nodded at the old gentleman until it is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.
dickens|Thatll be my pleasure.
austen|Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled.
dickens|Go and wait outside, Mike, said the clerk.
austen|Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family!
dickens|Attend to me.
austen|Happy those, who can remain at Highbury!
austen|I am talking of possibilities, Charles.
austen|Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.
austen|But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.
austen|She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear.
dickens|Can I in no way repay your confidence?
dickens|If I might touch him!
dickens|Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets?
austen|He cannot want moneyhe cannot want leisure.
austen|I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere.
dickens|Who else?
dickens|That makes it worse.
austen|But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.
austen|As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship!
austen|Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.
austen|There was one, however, which Emma thought something of.
dickens|Now, Mr Pip, pursued the lawyer, I address the rest of what I have to say, to you.
dickens|He was unrobed, and was none the better for it in appearance.
austen|However, I must say, that Robert Martins heart seemed for him, and to me, very overflowing; and that he did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their box at Astleys, my brother took charge of Mrs John Knightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy.
austen|my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass.
dickens|Often after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were singing Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss Havishams would seem to show me Estellas face in the fire, with her pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,often at such a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her just drawing her face away, and would believe that she had come at last.
dickens|Hed have their lives, and the lives of scores of em.
austen|I do not know her, even by sight.
austen|Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
dickens|The disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and was, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country.
dickens|Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go.
austen|The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never.
austen|I advise Mr Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty, said Mrs Bennet, to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.
austen|Do not defer it.
dickens|To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care.
austen|I have the pleasure, madam, to Mrs Bates, of restoring your spectacles, healed for the present.
dickens|I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had lapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had made and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits.
dickens|I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where I was going to.
austen|The next question was  What sort of looking man is Mr Martin?
austen|To suffer her to engage herselfto suffer her even to think of such a measure!
dickens|It was prevalent everywhere.
dickens|These things were within Mr Jarvis Lorrys knowledge, thoughts, and notice, when he rang the doorbell of the tranquil house in the corner, on the fine Sunday afternoon.
austen|I always had a value for him.
dickens|Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, in the postoffice branch of the service.
austen|They would be very much pleased.
dickens|All right, Mr Wemmick.
austen|She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words Most precious treasures on the top.
austen|she cried, looking aghast.
austen|I have not the pleasure of understanding you, said he, when she had finished her speech.
austen|Very nonsensical to come at all!
austen|And Mrs Perry and the children, how are they?
austen|Oh!
dickens|We had better go in.
austen|Sixtyfive miles farther than from Maple Grove to London.
austen|For Gods sake, say no more of his partners.
dickens|In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near Madame Defarges counter.
austen|Her colour changed, and she said no more.
dickens|I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a solitary country towards the river.
dickens|If your first teacher dear!
dickens|Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the mud, and round the corner of the prison wall.
dickens|I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mr Gargery, together, until he settles down.
dickens|Leave any for him?
austen|Her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.
austen|In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for halfanhour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy.
dickens|Have you followed my hand, Mr Barsad?
dickens|God bless you, Pip, old chap!
austen|Just as your drawings always are, my dear.
dickens|Ill let you know, if you dont bring smellingsalts, cold water, and vinegar, quick, I will.
austen|Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind.
dickens|Let me think.
austen|Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.
austen|It has a disagreeable look to me.
austen|Oh!
austen|Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs Bennet and the children.
dickens|And do you really go tonight?
austen|but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them.
dickens|Dont hurry.
austen|Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.
dickens|The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at alehouses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes.
austen|And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moments concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.
austen|And she was only sixteen last June.
austen|I am to hear from him soon, continued Mrs Weston.
austen|A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to a return of old feelings.
dickens|Mr Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical advice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a highly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heartache of begging him to accept my confidence.
austen|What a strange thing love is!
dickens|One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in the Lane, and he had seen them all go home.
dickens|I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time intending the journey.
dickens|A small lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousieblinds closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.
dickens|She rented a small cottage, and Mr Wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and occasionally bumping on the ceiling.
austen|They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.
austen|In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon Hartfield.
austen|That was well done of me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and chance.
austen|At length she spoke again.
dickens|I was going to excuse myself, when he added, Wemmicks coming.
dickens|At rum?
dickens|but no voice answered.
austen|Mrs Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.
austen|Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills, as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years marriage, he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.
dickens|Or mine, said the other, gruffly.
austen|She must have had much more to contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could.
dickens|If it passed to me from you, tomorrow  Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable.
austen|I have been walking over the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be.
dickens|Some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments of dress ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour.
dickens|With a thump and a soundOld Clem!
austen|Tiresome wretches!
dickens|The tall man is lost, and he is soughthow many months?
austen|However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against yoursand I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife.
dickens|said Defarge, with much indifference.
dickens|With you.
dickens|I looked at him attentively then, and recoiled a little from him; but I did not know him.
dickens|You are acquainted with the young lady, most probably?
dickens|most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that emigrant?
austen|But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her very differently affected.
austen|I like them all.
austen|Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew uncomfortable.
dickens|Never seen the Aged.
dickens|And then breakfast, sir?
dickens|Very much, said Estella, looking at me.
dickens|Come now and then; come on your birthday.
dickens|said Herbert Pocket.
dickens|Namely.
dickens|No.
dickens|Similarly, he dealt us clean plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair.
dickens|Herbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations.
dickens|But try!
austen|Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
dickens|Does he ever come back to this neighborhood?
dickens|Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I donewhich ud take a weekIll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pips comrade, that that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave.
dickens|And then fell to pulling off, not only his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a manner at once lighthearted, businesslike, and bloodthirsty.
dickens|said Mr Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backs of his warmed hands, Ill be plain with you, my friend Pip.
dickens|At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.
austen|yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was open, and the window was open, and Mr Knightley spoke loud.
austen|That is your date.
austen|He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up his time or his heart.
dickens|But she was so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly, in all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance, that I seemed to have made none.
dickens|What was in it, further than that it most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I cant tell you, because I dont know.
dickens|If I had died at the bottom there, and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his manacled hands, Id have held to him with that grip, that you should have been safe to find him in my hold.
dickens|When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the time with the tiger and the devil chainednot shownyet always ready.
dickens|You and me is not two figures to be together in London; nor yet anywheres else but what is private, and beknown, and understood among friends.
dickens|He must have been a green one.
dickens|cried my sister, addressing us both at once.
dickens|I said, It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.
austen|Mr Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
austen|He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed on her face.
dickens|Thankee, Pip.
dickens|Good Lord!
dickens|God knows.
dickens|said he.
austen|This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he stood up, in tall indignation, and said,  Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her.
dickens|Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, The wife of Evremonde; where is she?
dickens|Not personally, said I.
dickens|Estella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and then going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived I had discovered my real benefactor.
dickens|Vapour?
dickens|I can pass in and out when I choose.
austen|She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.
austen|for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.
dickens|What is it?
austen|Every body said that Mr Weston would never marry again.
austen|And so does poor Mrs Westonwith half a sigh and half a smile at her.
austen|Mr Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express.
austen|Mrs Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.
austen|They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs Weston was the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;and at the same moment Mr Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it.
dickens|You will be so lonely.
austen|Mrs Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingleys behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.
austen|So well lighted up!
austen|The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand, Hum!
dickens|My love to Lucie, and to little Lucie, said Mr Lorry at parting, and take precious care of them till I come back.
austen|how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner.
austen|She had no doubt as to his being less in lovebut neither his agitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long.
austen|My father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr Phillips, appears to do so much credit tobut he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.
dickens|I got here, Flopson?
dickens|If I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among those graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place recalled the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron and badge!
austen|Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived to be gone, that Mrs Weston and her companion taking leave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls.
dickens|Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch, that Mr Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly unprepared for.
austen|Mr Weston, tell me at once.
dickens|The father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ballwhen the one woman who had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness of Fate.
dickens|Belinda, remonstrated Mr Pocket, from the other end of the table, how can you be so unreasonable?
dickens|The door of the Doctors room opened, and he came out with Charles Darnay.
dickens|Might have been.
austen|then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so very happy to see herand now we are such a nice party, she cannot refuse.
austen|Mrs Bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,  Well, Jane, who is it from?
austen|The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.
austen|Well, well, and so Mr Bingley is coming down, sister, for Mrs Phillips first brought her the news.
austen|She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every part as she proceededand he was very much pleased, and, as she had foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.
dickens|The sharp female newlyborn, and called La Guillotine, was hardly known to him, or to the generality of people, by name.
austen|The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most prominent feeling.
austen|For we must attribute this happy conclusion, she added, in a great measure to his kindness.
austen|Not heard of you!
austen|You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr Suckling, sometimes flies about.
dickens|Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there,  said Mr Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, I cant be positive; yet I think I should.
dickens|N.
dickens|In the meanwhile, be silent!
austen|Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often.
austen|I do not know why you should say so.
dickens|As I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately at the shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman, who should come out of the bookshop but Mr Wopsle.
austen|I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day.
austen|He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?
austen|I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else.
austen|She is quite a little creature.
dickens|So there can be no competition or perplexity between you and me.
austen|nonone in the least.
dickens|cried my sister, in amazement.
dickens|I swore arterwards, sure as ever I speclated and got rich, you should get rich.
austen|Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.
dickens|What?
dickens|No; nor will she miss now, cries The Vengeance, petulantly.
austen|was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs.
dickens|No,  returned Wemmick, but I like to walk with one.
dickens|The rush of the daylight quite confounded me, and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange room many hours.
austen|In one moment such a change!
dickens|My wife came to your house to reclaim her father?
austen|And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love.
dickens|I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him, even though a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart, and he is a worthy, worthy man.
dickens|Kiss it!
dickens|said he, with a sharp look.
austen|He did, on the condition of some promises on her side such as that, if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house, as usual.
dickens|And shes out now, making it a bakers dozen.
dickens|Do you not see me here, in France, of my own will?
austen|The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.
dickens|If thou be changed into this shape by the will of God, say the seers to the enchanted, in the wise Arabian stories, then remain so!
dickens|By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and she told me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,she didnt say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant,but ever did his duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a gentle heart.
austen|She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr Westons good wine, and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense.
dickens|As a consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom, instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which the peaches ripened in their season.
austen|Oh!
austen|I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man.
austen|My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar way.
dickens|I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too.
austen|Oh!
dickens|To whom, likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.
dickens|Indeed, I begin to think we are not much alike in any particular, you and I.
austen|Mr and Mrs Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties, too strong for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr Weston, to remove.
austen|The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity.
austen|He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do.
dickens|But I do, and you must take my word for it.
austen|How strange it must appear to him!
dickens|said the Marquis again, in a wellsatisfied manner.
austen|If this be the case, he deserves you.
austen|As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid they would find no difficulty.
dickens|My brave wife, returned Defarge, standing before her with his head a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and attentive pupil before his catechist, I do not question all this.
austen|Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.
dickens|Who said she knew him?
dickens|Along the Paris streets, the deathcarts rumble, hollow and harsh.
dickens|He is a promising fellowin his waybut he may not have it all his own way.
austen|The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.
austen|Mrs John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to herand though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.
dickens|It falls.
austen|... cried Harriet, warmly.
dickens|You are again the prisoner of the Republic.
austen|She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin.
austen|Was he agreeable?
dickens|Not a word was spoken in either boat.
dickens|Make the best of it, my dear sir, said Stryver; say no more about it; thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!
austen|My aunt is not aware how late it is, nor how long we have been absentbut I am sure we shall be wanted, and I am determined to go directly.
austen|From perfect misery to perfect happiness!
dickens|The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time resolved, if his door were broken in he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament, to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet, and crush a man or two below.
austen|At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, Mr Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friendswhether he may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain.
austen|Indeed!
dickens|The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood, was illsmelling.
dickens|But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor grass.
austen|The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could understand.
dickens|Pip, said Estella, casting her glance over the room, dont be foolish about its effect on you.
dickens|If I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold your hand?
dickens|This was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, Is it so?
dickens|You think not, sir?
austen|You know who I mean nodding to her husband.
dickens|On board of the packetship just now referred to, sir, and on the same occasion.
austen|good Mr Perryhow is he, sir?
dickens|Let me but lift my finger!
dickens|That was before my time here, sir.
dickens|Come!
dickens|After breakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best parlor, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free.
austen|Good gracious!
dickens|Where will you put me?
austen|The loss of her daughter made Mrs Bennet very dull for several days.
austen|Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.
austen|She must laugh at such a close!
austen|We had better not mention it.
austen|If you have not been mistaken here, I must have been in error.
austen|Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself.
dickens|She stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure lying there.
dickens|Will you drink something before you go?
austen|A lively imagination soon settled it all.
dickens|All the women knitted.
dickens|I am all right, said gruff Old Orlick.
austen|but with many, many thanksthere was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr Knightleys carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.
dickens|I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in the morning.
austen|He had never seen so lovely a face, and was delighted with her naivete.
dickens|He would always creep inshore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature, even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; and I always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the backwater, when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in midstream.
dickens|I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me.
austen|I do not want to say more than is necessaryI am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and I dare say you understand me.
dickens|And sometimes, when her moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness, murmuring something in her ear that sounded like Break their hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!
austen|It was at Sir William Lucass, where a large party were assembled.
austen|Where I have a regard, I always think a person welllooking.
dickens|And, dear boy, how good looking you have growed!
austen|Fortunately, however, it did cease.
austen|Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.
austen|It is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found; for it shall be attended to.
dickens|The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed.
austen|You have reduced him to his present state of povertycomparative poverty.
dickens|sounded in my ears.
dickens|He said he had been with Lucie until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and keep his appointment.
dickens|Come!
austen|He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
dickens|Now, said Estella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, you are to take care that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.
dickens|Joes blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed first one of them, and then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner, with the round knob on the top of the poker.
dickens|Here, Mr Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and Mr Cruncher rose and stepped forward.
austen|He is half way to Windsor by this time.
dickens|Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there one left.
austen|which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed at.
dickens|That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the identification.
dickens|She seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied, Quite true.
austen|Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to hear it.
austen|Every body who saw it was pleased, but Mr Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every criticism.
austen|You are in luck.
dickens|He readily responded to his daughters drawing her arm through his, and tookand kepther hand in both his own.
dickens|Ever pay him?
dickens|To the best of my belief, those efforts entirely failed.
dickens|I took some wittles, up at the willage over yonder,where the church stands amost out on the marshes.
dickens|And do you take no one with you?
austen|perfectly.
austen|Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting; but still they were to part.
austen|But ever since we had the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr Dixon!
austen|The marriage of Lieut.
austen|Others of the party were now applied to.
austen|how rich and how great you will be!
dickens|Come!
austen|Emmas comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriets being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least.
dickens|Yes.
austen|who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!
dickens|If you knew all my story, she pleaded, you would have some compassion for me and a better understanding of me.
dickens|Was there ever such a boy as this!
austen|Yours ever,                                                        A.
austen|My dear, replied her husband, I have two small favours to request.
dickens|It was no nominal meal that we were going to make, but a vigorous reality.
dickens|The daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was more strictly kept.
dickens|I listened to the patients breathing, and avoided answering.
dickens|Yes it is, said I, because I cannot bear that people should say, she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest in the crowd.
dickens|I aint took so many year to make a gentleman, not without knowing whats due to him.
austen|It is excellent newscapital newsand about a certain person we all like!
austen|Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emmas opinion, had been talking enough of Mr Elton for that day.
dickens|The noble boy in the ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing himself, as it were in one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a gravedigger, a clergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court fencingmatch, on the authority of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were judged.
dickens|Biddy, I returned with some resentment, you are so exceedingly quick that its difficult to keep up with you.
austen|We neither of us perform to strangers.
dickens|Mr SolicitorGeneral then, following his leaders lead, examined the patriot John Barsad, gentleman, by name.
dickens|When we came to Pumblechooks, my sister bounced in and left us.
dickens|Yes.
austen|After another short hesitation, I hope it does not proceed fromI hope it is not in compliment to Mr Elton?
austen|cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composurethere would have been no danger.
dickens|The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips.
dickens|Is that the name of this house, miss?
dickens|I aint a going to be blest out of house and home.
austen|I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.
austen|What are you proud of?
dickens|They are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not?
dickens|Hah!
austen|He had been so fortunate as toI forget the precise wordsone has no business to remember them.
dickens|Clara and I have talked about it again and again, Herbert pursued, and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in her eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we come together, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince her husbands friend that he is her friend too.
dickens|Reward of ingratitoode to his earliest benefactor, and founder of fortuns.
dickens|As we walked along westward, he was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of the streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but he never otherwise recognized anybody, or took notice that anybody recognized him.
dickens|It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air.
austen|I shall certainly have her very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation.
dickens|It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing.
dickens|Mr Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words after Miss Pross, like somebody at church.
dickens|Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village tonight, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle.
austen|Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman.
dickens|Therefore, all the Old Bailey doors were well guardedexcept, indeed, the social doors by which the criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.
austen|How is it possible?
austen|A gentlemans family is all that I should condition for.
austen|So, Lizzy, said he one day, your sister is crossed in love, I find.
dickens|If I, as a honest tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring on water.
austen|So easily pleasedso little discerning;what signified her praise?
dickens|She asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an unwonted tone of sympathy.
austen|I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.
dickens|Will you wait for us a little, outside the door?
dickens|It was a day of some wild rejoicing, and a festival.
austen|where, where is my uncle?
austen|pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.
dickens|Not to be mentioned in Little Britain, said I.
dickens|Now, Biddy, said I, I am very sorry to see this in you.
austen|yes, said Elizabeth drily; Mr Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.
austen|I did, replied Emma, and they cannot forgive me.
dickens|I had never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope that the relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking.
dickens|He had a wild, lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughters voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.
austen|Emma thought at least it would turn out so.
austen|A piece of paper was found on the table this morningdropt, we suppose, by a fairycontaining a very pretty charade, and we have just copied it in.
dickens|The Vengeance followed.
austen|Colonel and Mrs Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,  said Jane.
dickens|Am I right, Jacques?
austen|Her not objecting does not justify him.
dickens|Little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register.
austen|Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity.
dickens|I had never dreamed of Joes having paid the money; but Joe had paid it, and the receipt was in his name.
dickens|There!
dickens|I coaxed myself to sleep by thinking of Miss Havishams, next Wednesday; and in my sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who held it, and I screamed myself awake.
dickens|So, sir, said Wemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, if you can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of a time in point of provisions.
dickens|She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of business you mentioned to her.
dickens|Youll get nothing.
austen|Certainly.
dickens|Are you intimate?
dickens|I am determined not to make a display of my feelings, but its very hard to be told one wants to feast on ones relations,as if one was a Giant,and to be told to go.
austen|and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer?
dickens|Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex?
dickens|I have said that he had reason to fear us.
dickens|And your mind will be more at rest?
dickens|And him you found?
dickens|Were youtriedin London?
dickens|?
dickens|This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden; very like.
austen|They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.
dickens|Why it came natural to me to do so, and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told her, I did not know then, though I think I know now.
austen|My sisters may write to me.
dickens|Well!
dickens|The two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this Bastille; the gentlemans, all negligent indifference; the peasants, all troddendown sentiment, and passionate revenge.
dickens|All right, said Wemmick, they shall be taken care of.
austen|Mr Knightley, he is not a trifling, silly young man.
dickens|Are you going to finish that pair of shoes today?
dickens|At any rate, said I, I have no warning given me just now, for you wrote to me to come to you, this time.
austen|I understand that Mr Collins has made you an offer of marriage.
dickens|And you are the better for it?
dickens|Dont cry, old chap!
dickens|The change was made in me; the thing was done.
dickens|The day happened to be Sunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought how it had grown and changed, and how the little wildflowers had been forming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and by night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning and tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed there came like a check upon my peace.
dickens|Here, he skipped from his right leg on to his left.
dickens|Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon?
dickens|Why am I confined alone?
austen|But when they had withdrawn, he said to her Mrs Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.
dickens|On the other hand, she often looked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his face never showed the least consciousness.
dickens|A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella.
dickens|Waiting for some reply, I looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken, and how the houseof wood with a tiled roofwould not be proof against the weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and ooze were coated with lime, and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a ghostly way towards me.
dickens|So I have made up my mind.
austen|I cannot agree with you.
austen|Consider what you are about.
austen|Emma took the opportunity of whispering,  You speak too plain.
dickens|Very interesting remembrances!
austen|She should see them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.
dickens|But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not understanding what had happened, came on at speed.
austen|At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucass accidental information, that Bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
austen|Your younger sisters must be very young?
dickens|said Mr Lorry.
dickens|Concerning a guardian, he went on.
austen|You make the best of itbut after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different creatures; you do not look like the same.
dickens|said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.
dickens|Though she called me boy so often, and with a carelessness that was far from complimentary, she was of about my own age.
dickens|We could not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent, that two or three times we had to halt while they rested.
austen|Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy!
austen|I see no sign of attachmentI believe nothing of the pianoforteand proof only shall convince me that Mr Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.
dickens|Yes?
austen|I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.
austen|Cannot you guess what this parcel holds?
austen|She felt immediately that she should like him; and there was a wellbred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.
dickens|Herbert, coming to my bedside when he came in,for I went straight to bed, dispirited and fatigued,made the same report.
dickens|It warnt easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warnt safe.
dickens|Instead of answering, Estella burst out laughing.
dickens|Halloa!
dickens|But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual satisfaction.
dickens|Light them, you!
austen|He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.
austen|This was one of her expressions.
dickens|You may take it in your hand; its no forgery.
dickens|Stranger things than that will happen when it does come, answered madame.
austen|It is Mr Wickhams intention to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.
austen|Elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression.
dickens|Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by degrees the childs wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a young ventriloquist with something in its mouth.
austen|I desire you will do no such thing.
austen|Here, resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, here is something still more valuable, I mean that has been more valuable, because this is what did really once belong to him, which the courtplaister never did.
austen|You are sick of prosperity and indulgence.
dickens|And so she never lifted her head up any more, and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on her own bed, because we found she was gone.
dickens|Quite, sir.
dickens|There, we meant to lie by all night.
dickens|I asked.
dickens|Him as sent the banknotes, Pip?
austen|You are very kind.
dickens|But, I was again taken and condemned.
dickens|He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.
austen|He had caught both substance and shadowboth fortune and affection, and was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself and his own concernsexpecting to be congratulatedready to be laughed atand, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been more cautiously gallant.
dickens|You wont find half so much fault in me if, supposing as you should ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forge window and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the old burnt apron, sticking to the old work.
austen|She thought it would be an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her to have much merit in planning it.
dickens|Glasses round!
austen|He came to speak to his father on a subject,to announce an attachment  She stopped to breathe.
austen|Well!
dickens|To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.
dickens|I have read him all, excepting only the last little sentence, and he wishes me most particular to write again what larks.
austen|Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs Eltons way beforeand no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if not in consciousness.
austen|What can be the meaning of this?
dickens|Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his uneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he resolved to follow in a postchaise.
dickens|I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth!
austen|That is the key to a great deal of capacity.
dickens|I have never taken to either, since I was bound.
austen|Mrs Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with her.
dickens|Go on!
dickens|I should have cried out, if I could.
dickens|Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators.
dickens|Well, my sweet, said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, the short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third; Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; and as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!
dickens|Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.
austen|I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a point of it.
austen|Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.
dickens|She was betrothed to a good young man, too a tenant of his.
austen|She regained the streethappy in this, that though much had been forced on her against her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfaxs letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.
austen|He came with Mrs Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially.
austen|You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in!
dickens|But go and see that droll dog, the little man persisted, calling after him.
dickens|Which I meantersay, Pip, Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr Trabb called formed in the parlor, two and two,and it was dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; which I meantersay, sir, as I would in preference have carried her to the church myself, along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect.
austen|I see your design, Bingley, said his friend.
austen|Mrs Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.
austen|And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded.
dickens|And theyre property.
austen|He came to tell Mr Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.
dickens|Still looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,  What do you want for them?
dickens|It superseded the Cross.
austen|How will a conundrum reckon?
dickens|After sipping his cognac to the end, he added  Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married.
dickens|Halloa!
austen|But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.
austen|A complete change of life became desirable.
dickens|You dont hear much about them now?
dickens|Mr Pocket uttered a dismal groan.
dickens|As if I was not already full to bursting!
austen|When Mr Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte.
dickens|Across the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted, and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea.
dickens|The mind.
austen|Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in her power.
dickens|He!
dickens|He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more.
dickens|After this memorable event, I went to the hatters, and the bootmakers, and the hosiers, and felt rather like Mother Hubbards dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades.
dickens|There is no time to lose.
dickens|The night deepened.
dickens|It would kill me if I saw her too soon.
dickens|Yes, maam.
dickens|I am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of disquiet than any you know of.
dickens|I did the same.
austen|By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.
austen|for I dare not hope, he continued in a lower and more serious tone, that he is improved in essentials.
dickens|I have a business charge to acquit myself of.
dickens|More composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used to talk, lying on the grass at the old Battery.
dickens|Not knowing that I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she said quietly,  Were you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in this condition?
dickens|Dont fear me.
dickens|Many things.
dickens|Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad day,But this man; he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten my being there; did you notice anything in him?
dickens|So we sat down to cards.
dickens|You must have observed, gentlemen, said he, an ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance expressive of low malignity, who went throughI will not say sustainedthe rôle if I may use a French expression of Claudius, King of Denmark.
dickens|We were always more or less miserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.
austen|That is, I presume it to be so on her side, and I can answer for its being so on his.
dickens|I answered, almost falling over her and checking myself.
dickens|Children?
austen|This would soon have led to something better, of course, was her consoling reflection; any thing interests between those who love; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart.
dickens|Their conference was very short, but very decided.
dickens|The moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white ceiling, which had passed away.
dickens|When I handed her down to the door, there was a child, a pretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage.
austen|The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her.
dickens|Not because I was squeezed in at an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and the Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to speak I didnt want to speak, nor because I was regaled with the scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure corners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason to be vain.
austen|I assure you, it did the children a great deal of good.
austen|This happened the night before last.
austen|She was obliged, in spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the justice that Mrs Weston foretold.
dickens|Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.
dickens|Tell me not it cannot be; I tell you this is him!
austen|Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room.
dickens|And see!
dickens|My present name, though but slightly changed from my mothers, is not, as you will remember, my own.
dickens|In England, for example?
austen|Miss Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot.
austen|How should I ever have borne it!
austen|The adieu is charity itself.
dickens|It is useless to say it, I know, but it rises out of my soul.
dickens|and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr Cruncher betook himself to his bootcleaning and his general preparation for business.
austen|I do not pretend to be a wit.
dickens|Dont let her lift me up to get it round me.
dickens|As compensation what for?
dickens|My dear girl is with her father; and if youll wait till she comes down, Ill make you known to her, and then well go upstairs.
dickens|When you go to dine with Mr Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.
austen|she was going to exclaim; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr Westons judgment; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection.
dickens|There started up, from the gate, or from the rushes, or from the ooze which was quite in his stagnant way, Old Orlick.
austen|Impropriety!
austen|I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very welland, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir Williams in his regimentals.
austen|Mr Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriets head.
dickens|Although I should not have thought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much as a look to Wemmicks Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way.
austen|, as you will conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early measures, but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose.
dickens|The dinner hour was halfpast one.
austen|I will keep my illhumour to myself.
dickens|The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing spirits of the scene noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving, anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check.
austen|While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible for her.
austen|Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyces Sermons.
austen|of what are you thinking?
dickens|Good day!
austen|I have often known it done myself.
austen|Oh, the difference of situation and habit!
austen|However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again.
dickens|I do not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he wasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day when the prison door closed upon him.
austen|We shall see if our styles suit.
dickens|Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.
dickens|And when it come to speechmaking, warnt it Compeyson as could speak to em wi his face dropping every now and then into his white pockethandkercher,ah!
dickens|A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved!
dickens|You have a husband, madame?
austen|No, not now, I thank you.
dickens|Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions whips, which twined snakelike about their heads in the evening air, as if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the postinghouse gate.
dickens|There was a ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppicewood, in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees.
austen|Not one.
dickens|I always thought this was business, this was the way to confront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat.
dickens|Dear boy, he answered, Im quite content to take my chance.
dickens|We are more afraid of you than of these others.
dickens|He was then dying fast.
austen|Not at all, he replied; they were brightened by the exercise.
dickens|And now you!
dickens|The carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.
dickens|Three.
dickens|I am going now, directly.
austen|The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.
dickens|Dear Joe, he is always right.
dickens|My opinion, miss, returned Mr Cruncher, is as youre right.
dickens|It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed.
dickens|He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of charitynever thought of such a thing.
austen|What a dreadful loss to you both!
austen|Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.
dickens|I hear, messieurs.
dickens|The first and the main thing to be done, said Herbert, is to get him out of England.
austen|If youll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.
austen|I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.
dickens|Now, there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr Jaggers principally rested his case.
dickens|Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldnt suit your line of business!
austen|Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!
austen|The evening before this great event for it was a very great event that Mr Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house.
austen|Mr Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
dickens|Let me go!
austen|At length, however, Mrs Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
austen|I am going away myself.
dickens|He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to return to Tellsons and take leave of Mr Lorry.
austen|Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.
austen|and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to methis pianoforte that has been sent here by somebodythough we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr Knightley?
dickens|And please, whats Hulks?
dickens|The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet echoing courts behind the High Street.
austen|Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her at last!
austen|She has known him only a fortnight.
austen|Not the slightest.
austen|In he walked, the first and the handsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle, where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her, would not sit at all.
austen|There was no comfort in having him in London; he might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse.
dickens|He was nothing to me, and I could have had no foresight then, that he ever would be anything to me, but it happened that I had this opportunity of observing him well.
dickens|That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his soninlaw was, through no malice or mischance, delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.
dickens|Where is he?
austen|Emma had done.
austen|Let me never see either one or the other again!
austen|Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes.
austen|She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.
austen|I am so glad to hear such a good account.
austen|I should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet.
dickens|After grinding a number of dull blades,of whom it was remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always going to help him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the blades had left the Grindstone,he had wearied of that poor work and had come to London.
dickens|Your fishingrod gets rayther rusty; dont it, father?
austen|And poor Johns son came to talk to Mr Elton about relief from the parish; he is very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help; and so, when Mr Elton came back, he told us what John ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr Frank Churchill to Richmond.
dickens|Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell downstairs of his own accord.
dickens|Beyond their dark line there was a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon.
dickens|An obliging stranger, under pretence of compactly folding up my banknotes for securitys sake, abstracts the notes and gives me nutshells; but what is his sleight of hand to mine, when I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!
austen|She hoped they might now become friends again.
dickens|I was perfectly frantic,a reckless witness under the torture,and would have told them anything.
austen|Upon my word, she cried, the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking.
austen|Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.
dickens|Never you mind.
dickens|There is an unconscionable old shark for you!
dickens|And so GOD bless you, dear old Pip, old chap, GOD bless you!
dickens|said the girl; but you see she dont.
dickens|But the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.
austen|Do you know it?
dickens|Not making the least account of the one with the delicate face, he returned, Bentley Drummle is his name, is it?
dickens|Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year.
dickens|Well!
austen|I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax today.
austen|My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable.
austen|She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.
austen|But I think Mr Darcy improves upon acquaintance.
dickens|If anybody wouldnt make an admission, he said, Ill have it out of you!
austen|I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can.
dickens|But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear.
austen|Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.
austen|You had it from himself, had you?
austen|For shame, Emma!
austen|My dearest child, she cried, I can think of nothing else!
austen|She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.
austen|The result of his reverie was, No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.
dickens|I kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances were favorable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that demonstration.
dickens|He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the scraps of the days journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage.
dickens|Well, said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, shes been on the Rampage, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip.
austen|She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.
dickens|Come, now.
dickens|But, there was no loud irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate clash again, and all was quiet.
dickens|But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received with cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a favor received, then this experimental trip should have no successor.
dickens|Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?
austen|Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public!
dickens|As to what is dearer to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the Republic.
dickens|Him that I speak of, said the landlord.
dickens|Looking back at him, I thought of the first night of his return, when our positions were reversed, and when I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him as it was now.
dickens|I asked the coachman.
dickens|The latter so received it, and remained silent.
dickens|Her hope had been to avert the wrath of Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many.
dickens|What do you mean by it?
austen|He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, the pianoforte!
dickens|I heard Mr Hubble remark that a bit of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do no harm, and I heard Joe say, You shall have some, Pip.
dickens|What did he call himself?
dickens|I am, said Mr Jaggers, and theres an end of it.
austen|I wonder what they are all doingwhether his sisters knowif he is unhappy, they will be unhappy too.
dickens|And Mr Wemmick made them, added Miss Skiffins, with his own hands out of his own head.
austen|Mr Martin is a very respectable young man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriets equal; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her.
dickens|Yes.
dickens|Good day, Pip, said Mr Jaggers, offering his hand; glad to have seen you.
dickens|It was a nice little dinner,seemed to me then a very Lord Mayors Feast,and it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.
dickens|Both in going and returning, I had seen the signal in his window, All well.
dickens|I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the guiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of conspiracy with convicts,a feature in my low career that I had previously forgotten.
austen|said she, beginning again when they were all in the street.
austen|My dear father, I congratulate you.
austen|Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr Knightley, if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emmas advice and go out for a quarter of an hour.
dickens|I am sure, uncle, returned Mrs Joe, I wish you had him always; you know so well how to deal with him.
dickens|You must marry.
dickens|For the rest, it is my Refuge.
dickens|Mr Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point in his mind, and Mr Carton made his way to the outside of the bar.
austen|I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.
dickens|Speak out, you know.
austen|How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?
dickens|The time is short, Evremonde, said the Spy, in a warning voice.
dickens|Mr Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognized in Joe the village idiot, and in me his keeper.
dickens|So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on a forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of milk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the dresser.
dickens|I was sent for life.
dickens|It appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under these circumstances nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that very evening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some information from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of moist sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D which she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I supposed, until she told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.
dickens|Have you seen him, to your certain knowledge, before?
austen|She had a sister married to a Mr Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.
austen|I have not a doubt of Mr Bingleys sincerity, said Elizabeth warmly; but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.
austen|Oh!
austen|And how tired you must be after your journey!
austen|But I hope you will not mind it it is all for Janes sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then.
dickens|And there he remained so long saying, Astonishing at intervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming back.
austen|my dear father, she cried, come back and write immediately.
dickens|cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary merit.
dickens|O Estella!
dickens|I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.
austen|Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken, said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother.
dickens|Where did you learn how I speak of others?
austen|Even Elizabeth began to fearnot that Bingley was indifferentbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.
dickens|What the Devil!
austen|I could not excuse a mans having more music than lovemore ear than eyea more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings.
dickens|She set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished.
austen|Mr Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;not like Mr Elton.
dickens|Please to go on.
dickens|There was life, and no more.
austen|Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriets cure; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much.
austen|But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.
dickens|She had installed herself, some time before, as Mr Lorrys cupbearer; and while they sat under the planetree, talking, she kept his glass replenished.
austen|She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out  Oh, my dear Eliza!
austen|I should not have thought it possible, she began, that you could have misunderstood me!
dickens|It had begun on Monday, and here was Wednesday come.
austen|He proved to me that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better.
dickens|And you know Mr Lorry.
dickens|The more business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney Carton, he always had his points at his fingers ends in the morning.
dickens|No.
austen|what a bloom of full health, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!
dickens|Which some individual, Joe politely hinted, mentionedshe.
dickens|No, miss, answered Mr Cruncher.
austen|The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the longexpected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.
dickens|Which I say, sir, replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if he were making his will, Miss A.
dickens|Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisonersdates, names, complaints, and prayers.
austen|Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr Darcy looked up.
austen|Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled.
austen|I will not be interrupted.
austen|Mrs Weston looked, and looked in vain.
austen|I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see.
dickens|Again my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted the whole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness, and her death, before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.
austen|This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in metwinkling away a tear or twobut it will be very trying for us to part with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful headache just now, writing all the morningsuch long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs Dixon.
austen|I have spent so many happy months there!
dickens|I know this is a confidence, she modestly said, after a little hesitation, and in earnest tears, I know you would say this to no one else.
dickens|He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in the cloth, and on that property married a young person in bedfurniture, with great rejoicings; the whole population of Portsmouth nine in number at the last census turning out on the beach to rub their own hands and shake everybody elses, and sing Fill, fill!
dickens|You WILL, will you?
austen|In the hope of diverting her fathers thoughts from the disagreeableness of Mr Knightleys going to London; and going so suddenly; and going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad; Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on the effect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,interested, without disturbing him.
dickens|You should have asked before you touched the hand.
austen|There, it is done.
dickens|There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized him.
dickens|said Stryver.
dickens|Also, I see that their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.
austen|It was certainly never brilliant, but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face.
dickens|They heard him mutter, One Hundred and Five, North Tower; and when he looked about him, it evidently was for the strong fortresswalls which had long encompassed him.
austen|It was a fortnight since Mrs Bennet had been downstairs; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high.
austen|When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr Suckling is extremely fond of exploring.
dickens|May you prosper!
dickens|You go out at the gate by which you brought me in?
austen|she cried.
austen|I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.
austen|I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at.
austen|The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.
austen|She coloured and laughed.
dickens|But care, care, care!
dickens|The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often the way with his tribe.
austen|I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior.
austen|His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be different from himself.
dickens|After trying it, Stryver, C.
dickens|He happened to be the only one.
dickens|I dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better than I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear her say those words.
dickens|As she looked at it, and drew in her head again, murmuring, Wretches!
austen|I admired your spirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well.
dickens|As to anything I say, you know, he insisted.
dickens|Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,  pursued Carton, you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into mine.
austen|He chose to say he was employed  Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr Knightley.
austen|Her inferiority, whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt.
austen|But ah!
austen|Wickham is safe.
dickens|Not if to lift this glass would do it!
austen|She had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness.
dickens|Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a velveteen suit and kneebreeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.
dickens|Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and such hands on a memorable occasion very lately!
austen|Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.
dickens|The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court, stopped the dialogue.
dickens|This is the writing of Doctor Manette.
austen|At her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her.
austen|I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.
austen|Ladies and gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse who, wherever she is, presides to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking of?
dickens|Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of me.
austen|Let us wait, therefore, for this letter.
dickens|exclaimed Jacques Three, rapturously.
austen|Mrs Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfs calling yesterday to thank me?
dickens|But get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?
austen|If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!
dickens|We had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his promise to tell me about Miss Havisham.
austen|It was now about the time that she was likely to call.
austen|On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any thingMr Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they could command and never had any body such good neighbours was distasteful.
dickens|All this I saw in a moment, for I had only a moment to see it in he swore an oath at me, made a hit at me,it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself down, for it made him stumble,and then he ran into the mist, stumbling twice as he went, and I lost him.
dickens|To the boy, and with a dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreants brushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.
dickens|Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain, resumed the countryman, that he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed.
austen|A very serious sort, I assure you; still smiling.
austen|She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentlemans return.
austen|You must promise me not to sit up.
dickens|His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and he earned as much as he wanted.
dickens|I alluded to the advantages I had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might have done better without me and my expectations.
austen|Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.
dickens|Had you any conversation with the prisoner?
dickens|The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, Of how long duration?
dickens|Pardon me!
austen|But, said I, to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without something of a musical society.
austen|Yes, thought Elizabeth, that would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once.
dickens|Whatll you drink, Mr Gargery?
austen|No, no.
austen|Two such she did not want.
austen|I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting Mr Weston, that excellent Mr Weston, I think there is nothing he does not deserve.
dickens|Now, Ill try you again.
dickens|Ill have no feelings here.
dickens|Are you turned in a pleasant direction?
austen|Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.
dickens|Now, my dear Lucie, drawing his arm soothingly round her waist, I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear.
austen|I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
austen|There it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven!
dickens|It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the planetree, and they should sit there in the air.
dickens|Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.
dickens|But, he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr Lorry either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.
austen|You must have seen that I did.
austen|It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect for me.
dickens|The butcher and the porkman painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of meagre loaves.
dickens|On this first occasion of his producing it, I recalled how he had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he had described himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude.
austen|Mrs Smallridge, a most delightful woman!
dickens|Some medical beast had revived Tarwater in those days as a fine medicine, and Mrs Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard; having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness.
austen|Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it must have been.
dickens|The one who had been mauled, he answered readily, and Ill swear I saw him!
dickens|Here it is, said Mr Wopsle.
dickens|Let us draw further back.
austen|On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawingroom, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.
dickens|It is the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge, which was already very large.
austen|She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathingplace covered with officers.
dickens|And you read em; dont you?
dickens|But, Mr Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so confident, having seen it; and more.
austen|I am very glad I did think of her.
austen|To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet.
austen|dear, I thought it would have been the death of me!
austen|I cannot think of it without abhorrence.
dickens|Joe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve before his eyes.
dickens|Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?
austen|Miss Campbell always was absolutely plainbut extremely elegant and amiable.
dickens|Having his hand in, Mr Wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third, and seemed to think he had done quite enough to account for it when he added, as the poet says.
austen|Me!
dickens|I am rather bare here, but I hope youll be able to make out tolerably well till Monday.
dickens|I will not rest a moment.
austen|And quite alone?
austen|My dear Emma, said he, moving from his chair into one close by her, you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant evening.
dickens|It was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the river passing beyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low, looking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the bottom of the water.
austen|Living constantly with rightminded and wellinformed people, her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbells residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of firstrate masters.
dickens|Help, every one!
austen|Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcys meditated elopement.
austen|Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.
dickens|Some, to the fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside.
austen|Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of being kindly spoken of.
austen|How I catch myself out!
dickens|He did it for me.
dickens|Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr Lorry?
dickens|My hair had been caught by the fire, but not my head or face.
austen|Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.
dickens|You should have said, short as a dwarf, returned Jacques Two.
dickens|I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature in which sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to think I was right, and I walked down the little path away from Biddy, and Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and took a dejected stroll until suppertime; again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this, the second night of my bright fortunes, should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.
dickens|So imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr Wemmick.
austen|,  EDW.
austen|Him!
austen|Mans boasted power and freedom, all are flown.
austen|He sat by her at dinner.
dickens|That night, the last night of the year, towards nine oclock, a man in a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, upstairs.
austen|At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the other had been the person; and nowit is possible  She paused a few moments.
dickens|I shall do well enough, and so will my husband.
dickens|In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting.
austen|Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.
austen|Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both the Mr Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;and two basins only were ordered.
austen|And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything.
austen|The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs Reynolds was of no trifling nature.
dickens|And when you hear him go, I think youll say hes a Stinger.
dickens|I tell you, I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.
austen|cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called at Mrs Goddards in his way.
dickens|Never clapped eyes upon her!
austen|Such was Jane Fairfaxs history.
austen|She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,  It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility.
austen|To be sure!
dickens|The horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with their swords.
austen|My dearest sister, now be serious.
austen|Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was illjudged.
austen|If you want any farther explanation, continued he, smiling, they are paid for it.
dickens|At what hour did he come on board?
dickens|The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended them.
dickens|You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen?
dickens|Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.
austen|Emma divined what every body present must be thinking.
dickens|The Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint Antoines bosom.
dickens|Now lookee here, he said, the question being whether youre to be let to live.
austen|It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.
dickens|So I begun wi Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands.
dickens|The Doctor gave him his hand.
dickens|He put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of face, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of England.
dickens|What is it?
austen|Her views of improving her little friends mind, by a great deal of useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few first chapters, and the intention of going on tomorrow.
austen|We have nothing clever to saynot one of us.
austen|In all probability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr Elton, if not towards William Larkins.
austen|They must have seen them together for ever.
austen|no, no, Henry must have Donwell.
dickens|As if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers.
austen|What is your opinion?
dickens|Every day, in all weathers, from two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes without.
austen|She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
dickens|Where is your wife, Evremonde?
dickens|Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their time.
dickens|Its a terrible thing, Joe; it aint true.
dickens|His what?
austen|I told you yesterday, cried Mr Weston with exultation, I told you all that he would be here before the time named.
dickens|he urged, with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek.
austen|There is nothing else to be done.
dickens|Who am I, cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor and flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in surprise,who am I, for Gods sake, that I should be kind?
dickens|As we were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as I breakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely hold my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a walk, and that I would go on along the London road while Mr Jaggers was occupied, if he would let the coachman know that I would get into my place when overtaken.
austen|She was not present when the suspicion first arose.
dickens|Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet on Saint Dunstans side of Temple Bar, bursting in his fullblown way along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have seen how safe and strong he was.
austen|Well, Mrs Weston, said Emma triumphantly when he left them, what do you say now to Mr Knightleys marrying Jane Fairfax?
dickens|He mentioned that there was an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred before in that or any other neighborhood.
dickens|He got his arm round her, and held her.
dickens|You can put them to some other poor boys use.
dickens|As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away, when it stopped, and let me come up with it.
dickens|As to the uncertain travelling, the long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellsons, after all these years, who ought to be?
dickens|He immediately began to talk to Drummle not at all deterred by his replying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to screw discourse out of him.
austen|Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.
dickens|Now, said Herbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, hes down again on his back!
dickens|How did you come there, that day?
dickens|The tinder was damp,no wonder there,and one after another the sparks died out.
austen|Good morning to you,said he, rising and walking off abruptly.
austen|Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected?
dickens|I have seen blue eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held them up.
dickens|Little Alick in a frock has already made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew.
dickens|There it is.
austen|But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the way.
dickens|People are so unreasonable!
dickens|Come asunder!
austen|His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.
dickens|Do I say yes, mamma?
austen|She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the subject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of my excellent friend Colonel Campbell.
dickens|Had the birds, carrying some grains of it to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds?
austen|Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.
austen|The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.
austen|The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English, such as Mr Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the happiness of her father.
dickens|With my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I rose out of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it, looking wildly at him.
dickens|Dear boy, he said, as I sat down by his bed I thought you was late.
dickens|Respectin any present use o this here blessed old head o mine, I think not.
austen|How was she to bear the change?
dickens|Next day, fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before Charles Darnays name was called.
austen|It is very natural.
austen|Though, perhaps, as the Chaperon of the partyI never was in any circleexploring partiesyoung ladiesmarried women  Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,  Very true, my love, very true.
dickens|Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his putting himself in the way of being taken.
dickens|Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home together, and to rest in her bosom.
dickens|A happy circumstance for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured!
dickens|It was impossible for Monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring Heavens.
austen|Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friends permission, or being bold enough to come without it.
dickens|It was a profounder remark than Mr Lorry had looked for.
austen|But sometimes of an evening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining.
austen|He could not believe her to be encouraging him.
dickens|What did you say?
dickens|I was not averse to doing this, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the waterside people there.
dickens|Any word of that sort.
dickens|Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back!
austen|And she, Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment, but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr Elton.
austen|But have you really heard of nothing?
dickens|In going, he had to face Miss Pross.
austen|This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
austen|They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone.
dickens|Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which she had hitherto remained standing.
dickens|When I and my friends repaired to him at six oclock next day, he seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual, for we found him with his head butted into this closet, not only washing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat.
austen|Let them be sent to Donwell.
austen|What he means to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again tomorrow evening.
austen|I do admire your patriotism.
dickens|I hunted him down.
austen|He knew nothing about it, Emma.
austen|At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.
austen|I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.
austen|Thank God!
austen|It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose prospects were closing, while Harriets opened, and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her kindnessand with Emma it was grown into a first wish.
dickens|Keys turned, doors clashed, footsteps passed along distant passages no cry was raised, or hurry made, that seemed unusual.
dickens|Long enough to be tired of it, returned Drummle, pretending to yawn, but equally determined.
dickens|Well, said I, not desirous of more conversation, shall I go up to Miss Havisham?
dickens|Yes.
austen|It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.
dickens|The galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager lookout at the water was resumed.
dickens|I have passed from one to another, in the course of my business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere machine.
austen|Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter, at least she thought so.
dickens|the old gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.
austen|And mine, said Mr Knightley warmly, is, that if he turn out any thing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing!
austen|She would not listen, therefore, to her daughters proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.
austen|No, I thank you, she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.
austen|Do you dare say this?
dickens|What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me?
austen|Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can at any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you.
austen|Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr and Mrs Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs Jenkinson to make up her party.
dickens|That was the manner of our beginning to speak together.
austen|But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised.
dickens|You see, blacksmith, said the sergeant, who had by this time picked out Joe with his eye, we have had an accident with these, and I find the lock of one of em goes wrong, and the coupling dont act pretty.
austen|More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed.
austen|Oh no!
dickens|Ah!
austen|There is nothing the matter with me.
austen|He had not been at Donwell for two years.
austen|I told my sister Phillips so the other day.
austen|This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter, said Elizabeth.
austen|What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr Bingley, is not he?
austen|Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!
dickens|Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head beside her husbands cheerfully.
austen|It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane, said she.
austen|She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails;it was at her tongues endbut she abstained.
dickens|Whoop!
austen|By birth she belonged to Highbury and when at three years old, on losing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the consolation, the foundling of her grandmother and aunt, there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there; of her being taught only what very limited means could command, and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and warmhearted, wellmeaning relations.
austen|It is always the ladys right to decide on the degree of acquaintance.
austen|Emmas pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted; but on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her.
austen|They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.
dickens|He never looked at me.
dickens|Hush!
dickens|Prettily pointed!
dickens|And do you defend her, Matthew, said Mrs Pocket, for making mischief?
dickens|It shall be done, sir.
austen|Here have I been sitting this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obediencefor who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?
dickens|I am what you have made me.
austen|If there had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment.
dickens|I do you justice; I believe it.
dickens|The gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here.
austen|Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?
austen|here it is.
dickens|If I had been her secretary, steward, halfbrother, poor relation,if I had been a younger brother of her appointed husband,I could not have seemed to myself further from my hopes when I was nearest to her.
austen|My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.
austen|After tea, Mr and Mrs Weston, and Mr Elton sat down with Mr Woodhouse to cards.
dickens|Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a rich lady some years afore, and theyd made a pot of money by it; but Compeyson betted and gamed, and hed have run through the kings taxes.
dickens|J.
dickens|But, no Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr Lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of Miss Prosss prediction.
dickens|If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.
austen|Mr Hurst and Mr Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs Hurst was observing their game.
dickens|said The Vengeance.
austen|I knew how it would be.
dickens|asked Mr Pumblechook.
dickens|Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects multiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and her speech was unintelligible.
dickens|He was so perfectly innocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to Biddy in preference.
dickens|Such things as could be said for him were said,how he had taken to industrious habits, and had thriven lawfully and reputably.
dickens|Waiting until she was quiet again,for this, too, flashed out of her in a wild and sudden way,I went on.
dickens|He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask.
austen|To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.
austen|Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice!
austen|Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said  You are mistaken, Mr Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.
dickens|Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth, stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would be glad if I could come and see him again upon it.
austen|He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them.
austen|This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning.
austen|At first, if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been matches of greater disparity those were your very words;I should not have dared to give way toI should not have thought it possibleBut if you, who had been always acquainted with him  Harriet!
austen|Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs Collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.
austen|Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydias side, but nothing to give him any alarm.
dickens|growled a redcap, striking at the coverlet with the buttend of his musket.
dickens|Whats the matter now?
austen|Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.
dickens|His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several times, to take off his hat to scratch his head.
austen|I dare say Mr Knightley will be so kind as to meet him.
dickens|He wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his head which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.
dickens|And if you were, I wont be took the liberty with.
dickens|You hadnt come into your good fortune at that time?
austen|Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading them forward to the great event.
austen|Pain is no expiation.
austen|and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun!
dickens|Yes, said Mr Wopsle.
dickens|You neednt know theyre there.
austen|He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.
dickens|Looking at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the honest men.
dickens|And to take that ugly thing away from her?
austen|You know, Mrs Weston, you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves.
dickens|echoed my sister; trouble?
austen|The spring I always think requires more than common care.
dickens|asked Mr Lorry.
dickens|Ask me to do anything in my office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent.
dickens|My dear Biddy, they do very well here  O!
dickens|She put the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread and meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in disgrace.
dickens|Say so over and over again, if you have the heart to think so.
austen|He had gone beyond the sweepsome way along the Highbury roadthe snow was nowhere above half an inch deepin many places hardly enough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present, but the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its being soon over.
dickens|the President desired to know.
dickens|When I ask that, refuse.
austen|It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.
austen|when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again!
dickens|Then look here.
austen|But what is the meaning of this?
austen|Mr Collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.
austen|Shall you like to have such a brother?
dickens|The kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man who was tired out.
austen|I shall go distracted.
dickens|For an instant, and no more, she would pause to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she would repeat the cry, My husband, my father, and my brother!
dickens|And why did I do it, I should like to know?
dickens|That I sometimes struggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and that I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and would then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me down, I also knew at the time.
austen|I want to inquire after you all, but particularly your niece.
dickens|perhaps they thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.
dickens|It was beginning to rain fast.
austen|Oh!
austen|There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,  said she, that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr Eltons intentions.
austen|it was melancholy to leave her to such society!
austen|Another hour or twos snow can hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand.
austen|Oh, yes!
dickens|Then, among the advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of her prattling words.
austen|You are right.
dickens|How then?
dickens|They bring him into the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill, and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night, and swallow himlike this!
dickens|Now, Aggerawayter!
austen|A walk before breakfast does me good.
dickens|What strength there is in these common bodies!
austen|He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.
dickens|The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog.
austen|I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.
austen|Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.
austen|Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed, cried Emma.
austen|Look at her.
dickens|My husband.
austen|Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.
austen|But are you pleased, Jane?
dickens|I exclaimed, in amazement.
austen|A warm climate may be prescribed for her.
dickens|He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes.
austen|In spite of the answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs Batess, in the hope that Jane would be induced to join herbut it would not do;Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest serviceand every thing that message could do was triedbut all in vain.
dickens|In short, I should make that choice.
dickens|So, I walked a little further with Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.
austen|What you direct in this house cannot be wrong.
austen|Miss Taylor, if you had not married, you would have staid at home with me.
dickens|he said, I was, and got convicted.
dickens|What is the matter?
dickens|Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat of defiance in his manner, and said, A last word, Mr Darnay you think I am drunk?
austen|As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs Bennet followed her, saying  I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.
austen|I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.
austen|I never saw such a woman.
austen|Mr Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.
austen|She must see more of him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they were agreeable.
dickens|Miss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said checking a yawn, The idea!
austen|No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural talent forthinks strongly and clearlyand when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts naturally find proper words.
austen|She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usuala glow both of complexion and spirits.
dickens|I asked him.
austen|One thing only.
austen|Command yourself enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.
dickens|I know that, to be sure, assented Mr Lorry, trying to persuade himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, but I am determined to be peevish after my long days botheration.
austen|Mrs Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,  Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.
austen|How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?
austen|None of that upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man should display in every transaction of his life.
austen|You and I shall not want opportunities.
dickens|He crossexamined his very wine when he had nothing else in hand.
dickens|I know, said Darnay, respectfully, how can I fail to know, Doctor Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and child.
austen|Mr Knightley, said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confusedI am in a very extraordinary situation.
dickens|He comes here at the peril of his life, for the realization of his fixed idea.
austen|Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the Very true, my love, which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all.
dickens|She faintly shook her head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done.
austen|Jane, indeed!
austen|It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriets imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed.
dickens|There has been no new discovery, of money, or of any other property; but  He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped.
austen|I knew how it would be.
austen|I cannot rate her beauty as you do, said he; but she is a pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition.
dickens|The governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away.
dickens|While those were down, the rest linked hand in hand, and all spun round together then the ring broke, and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then reversed the spin, and all spun round another way.
dickens|The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea, that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the suggestion to have em out, and to pull em out, mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop.
dickens|Door!
austen|We will not despair, however.
austen|Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again; and the last halfhour of an evening which Mr Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject.
austen|You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances.
austen|Oh!
austen|Ah!
austen|She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural selfconsequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncles good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.
austen|His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered.
austen|He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
dickens|Youre in the habit of shaking hands?
austen|But at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey.
dickens|His enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his arms folded on the table, shaking his head at me and hugging himself, had a malignity in it that made me tremble.
austen|I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax, said Emma.
dickens|I must acknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said is not my own, but my fathers.
austen|I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off matchmaking.
austen|Oh!
austen|I see how it is, said she.
austen|Just colour enough for beauty.
austen|When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.
dickens|The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a mans voice called from the mist, Is that the Dover mail?
austen|His fathers marriage, he said, had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him.
dickens|Show it me!
dickens|Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your life and home, and being faithful to you to the death.
dickens|In the same instant I heard responsive shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door, heard voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of men, as if it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly out into the night.
dickens|Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing.
austen|It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingleys pretended regard.
dickens|As the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there, but eluded my touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman to come quickly; telling him of the incident on the way back.
dickens|Play.
dickens|I foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be forfeited to the Crown.
dickens|Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand.
dickens|Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be relied upon, came quickest.
austen|I expected you to stay two months.
dickens|Ah!
austen|The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.
dickens|A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre  Buried how long?
dickens|A man neednt go far to find a subject, if hes ready with his saltbox.
dickens|It was a hard parting, though it was not for long.
dickens|The voice returned, Quite right, and the window was shut again, and a young lady came across the courtyard, with keys in her hand.
dickens|His right name was Compeyson; and thats the man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch, according to what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last night.
austen|Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.
dickens|Well!
dickens|Youd be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, Jerry!
austen|Service!
austen|She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was peculiarly gratifying.
dickens|Well!
austen|Mr Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say, and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.
dickens|An enemy to the Republic!
dickens|Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high overhead all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits.
austen|It would be very hard upon Mr Weston if she did not, papa.
dickens|When the AttorneyGeneral ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blueflies were swarming about the prisoner, in anticipation of what he was soon to become.
austen|She had brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared, on Mr Knightley.
austen|But, upon my word, Mr Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself.
austen|Oh!
austen|Indeed!
dickens|Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.
dickens|He had opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.
austen|Yes, all of them, I think.
austen|I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.
austen|I want to puzzle you again.
austen|He has only to speak.
austen|Her change was equal.
austen|She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of motives, might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty.
dickens|It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the coast down, madly.
dickens|He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them.
dickens|But my dear!
dickens|The worst will be over in a moment; it is but passing the roomdoor, and the worst is over.
austen|The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the first subject on meeting.
austen|Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.
dickens|There was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged me.
dickens|No brewing was going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long time.
dickens|Go to him, Biddy say, without loss of time.
dickens|The quick noise and movement of the courts emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face but love and consolation.
dickens|So we all put our pockethandkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noses were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and Pumblechook; Mr and Mrs Hubble.
austen|He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.
dickens|nothing came of the late struggle.
austen|Very well I thank you.
austen|You will excuse her not coming to youshe is not ableshe is gone into her own roomI want her to lie down upon the bed.
dickens|Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal.
austen|I am quite determined to refuse him.
austen|It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.
austen|I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.
austen|And he, the very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to, quite like Mr Knightley!
austen|are you there?
dickens|When the Sessions came round, Mr Jaggers caused an application to be made for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions.
austen|But my dear Elizabeth, she added, what sort of girl is Miss King?
dickens|Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I should know it to be a baseness.
austen|And men take care that they should.
austen|To fall in with each other on such an errand as this, thought Emma; to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase of love on each side.
austen|But dont imagine it was from any silly cause.
dickens|Why, I have been ashamed of your moroseness there!
dickens|When he came back, he ascended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus into the Doctors rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.
dickens|If there wereCharles Darnay, if there were  The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as the Doctor spoke  any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man she really lovedthe direct responsibility thereof not lying on his headthey should all be obliterated for her sake.
dickens|I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself.
dickens|Oh, father, I should so like to be a ResurrectionMan when Im quite growed up!
dickens|cried Lucie.
austen|I was once very nearand I wish I hadit would have been better.
austen|from Yorkshire, I think.
austen|It confesses that you have long understood me.
austen|It is his own idea.
austen|Janes temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.
dickens|After a pause, they both heartily congratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their congratulations that I rather resented.
austen|He would either have gloried in the achievement, or been ashamed of it.
austen|Dr Hughes I declareand Mrs Hughes.
austen|The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.
dickens|cried the stranger, calling to the landlord.
austen|The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to.
austen|I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to see her.
austen|The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion.
austen|Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude, replied Elizabeth, have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.
dickens|Had he stood in peril of a less horrible sentencehad there been a chance of any one of its savage details being sparedby just so much would he have lost in his fascination.
dickens|Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he started with it on the wet, wet roads at three oclock in the morning.
dickens|returned the spy.
austen|Here is the rivet of your mistresss spectacles out.
dickens|I told her so, and told her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of that country.
austen|Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak.
dickens|Tell her, tonight, what you know of her danger as involving her child and her father.
dickens|Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr Cartons part in the days proceedings; nobody had known of it.
dickens|I devote you, said this person, stopping at the last door on his way, and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, to the Devil!
austen|If there were but such another man for you!
austen|And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for.
dickens|The passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek.
austen|Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening.
dickens|Would he, asked Mr Lorry, be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on him?
dickens|Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it with a sick feeling, and thought, And here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death.
dickens|I was only saying my prayers.
dickens|She answered so carelessly, that I said, You speak of yourself as if you were some one else.
dickens|I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and my own gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades, said Wemmick, in acknowledging my compliments.
dickens|It was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to France.
austen|Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr Bingleys friend, without being heard by either of them.
austen|She could only resolve at last, that she would still avoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by letter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury, andindulging in one scheme morenearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square.
austen|It ought to be good, he replied, it has been the work of many generations.
dickens|The second greatest surprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again, looking up at me out of a black eye.
dickens|At my expense?
dickens|The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone down, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was likeliest to come ashore.
austen|He shook his head and laughed.
austen|Waiving that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and goodnatured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninetynine people out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall in love with wellinformed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a claim to be nice.
dickens|Monseigneur, it is true.
austen|He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted, encouraged attentions.
austen|Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved.
dickens|You with a uncle too!
austen|Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeths wishes, for she was impatient to get home.
austen|They had been meeting almost every day since his arrival.
austen|or had you intended any more serious consequence?
dickens|Dear Miss Havisham, said Miss Sarah Pocket.
austen|How much I am obliged to you, said he, for telling me to come today!
austen|William seemed rather out of humour.
austen|I wish I may not sink into poor Emma with him at once.
dickens|Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr Jaggers is another.
austen|She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined.
austen|I never saw any thing so outree!
dickens|No, dont be hurt, she pleaded quite pathetically; let only me be hurt, if I have been ungenerous.
dickens|It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.
austen|She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs Collinss joints of meat were too large for her family.
austen|That is a failing indeed!
dickens|You liked your bit of game, didnt you?
dickens|said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon.
dickens|Mr Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?
dickens|The child, who was nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, A life you love.
austen|But I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out.
dickens|In Francewho, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.
austen|And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body.
austen|They sat down to teathe same party round the same tablehow often it had been collected!
austen|Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.
austen|Dont keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heavens sake!
dickens|Thank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving it from him.
austen|Not Frank;it is not Frank, I assure you.
dickens|What!
dickens|Ah, I dare say I did.
austen|His letters disgust me.
dickens|My fault is, that I have been true to you.
dickens|No, Jerry, no!
austen|I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing.
austen|But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.
austen|Mr Collins made his declaration in form.
dickens|On his coming out, the concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the shore.
dickens|My petition is, that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husbands name, may be placed over him to show where he lies.
dickens|That must never be, croaked Jacques Three; no one must escape.
austen|I thought you had lost half your property, at least.
dickens|I would recommend him to sacrifice it.
dickens|He seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another furious roar.
dickens|Not yet.
dickens|Now, unfold it and tell me what it is.
dickens|Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Prosss service.
dickens|repeated the landlord.
austen|And what claims has Lydiawhat attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?
dickens|It was enough that he could and did see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have waited out the day, seven days a week.
austen|I cannot pretend to be sorry, said Wickham, after a short interruption, that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen.
austen|said she; that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier to you.
austen|To be sure that did seem as if he admired herindeed I rather believe he didI heard something about itbut I hardly know whatsomething about Mr Robinson.
austen|When Mr Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as before, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.
austen|The mistake had been slight.
dickens|Bless you.
austen|It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
dickens|That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of today, or of yesterday, or even of last year, or of the year before.
dickens|At first, I meant no more.
austen|I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.
dickens|But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him resolute not to tell her what impended he had been half moved to do it, so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid, and the day passed quickly.
dickens|I wont hear a word.
dickens|I have tracked you through it all, and I tell it you all.
dickens|So he told it, and Herbert was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellow and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment.
dickens|The blackhole of that ship warnt a strong one, to a judge of blackholes that could swim and dive.
dickens|Alexandre Manette, said Defarge in his ear, following the letters with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder.
dickens|Biddy, said I, after binding her to secrecy, I want to be a gentleman.
austen|To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been selfimposed.
austen|A thorough, determined dislike of mea dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.
austen|Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this the best offer she was likely to have.
dickens|This business transacted, I turned my face, on my own account, to Little Britain.
austen|She does not yet leave her dressingroom.
dickens|Which I meantersay, if the ghost of a mans own father cannot be allowed to claim his attention, what can, Sir?
dickens|Thank God, said Mr Lorry, clasping his hands, that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town tonight.
dickens|And now let me have a look at my gentleman agen.
austen|Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.
austen|I come in for a pretty good share as a second.
dickens|politely omitting young fellow.
austen|And his sisters are charming women.
austen|He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passedhe had not stopped, he would not stop for more than a wordbut he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call, and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off.
austen|Mr Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome, the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.
austen|Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent, said she, did he come at all?
dickens|I mentioned to Mr Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes sent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him.
dickens|Mr Pocket had invested the Princes treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest.
dickens|Though his manner was less satisfied than his words.
dickens|On my turning round, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went out, I heard Sarah Pocket say, Well I am sure!
dickens|I was disappointed to find that the day was a holiday; no children were there, and Biddys house was closed.
austen|You are better placed here; very fit for a wife, but not at all for a governess.
austen|But Harriet was less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.
dickens|Looked out upon a throng of men and women not enough in number, or near enough, to fill the courtyard not more than forty or fifty in all.
austen|She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.
austen|Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.
austen|I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well.
dickens|That part of the subject I reminded her involved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they were the weighty secrets of another.
dickens|Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence?
austen|Miss Bates looked about her, so happily!
austen|Your uncle is as much surprised as I amand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done.
dickens|Amelia, is it?
austen|You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.
austen|Miss Darcys praise occupied the chief of it.
austen|Nobody could nurse her, as we should do.
dickens|Anyhow, it was hot enough when it was up, as you may suppose.
austen|Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world.
dickens|See, then, said Herbert; think of this!
dickens|Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear.
dickens|Not that its arrival brought me either; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the coachoffice in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the Blue Boar in our town.
dickens|Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?
dickens|Monsieur, it is a cell.
austen|As to the pretence of trying her native air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.
austen|Mr Bingley followed his advice.
austen|A conundrum of Mr Westons shall clear him and his next neighbour.
dickens|Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing horribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped; and I saw in his hand a stonehammer with a long heavy handle.
austen|I have heard it asserted, said John Knightley, that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master teaches, it is natural enough.
austen|To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought.
dickens|And she caught his wrist with both her hands.
dickens|The dear little thing, returned Herbert, holds dutifully to her father as long as he lasts; but he wont last long.
dickens|Mr Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but Temple Bar.
austen|I can recall nothing worse.
dickens|He was awfully cold, to be sure.
dickens|Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought to have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, and admired her beyond measure.
dickens|You dont object to an aged parent, I hope?
dickens|asked the younger brother.
dickens|The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey.
austen|I want a change.
dickens|I had again left my boat at the wharf below Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and, undecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and was strolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busy concourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one overtaking me.
austen|For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a bedroom appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible just at present.
austen|That will just do for me, you know.
austen|You did not enjoy them as I did; you appeared tired the whole time.
dickens|But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the first duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he ought to hear.
austen|I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.
dickens|ALL, Joe repeated, very emphatically.
austen|While he spoke, Emmas mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful velocity of thought, had been ableand yet without losing a wordto catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriets hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as complete a delusion as any of her ownthat Harriet was nothing; that she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had been all received as discouragement from herself.
dickens|Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account to both of us, in such different ways.
austen|I dare say they often think of you, and wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instruments coming to hand.
austen|He was afraid they should have a very bad drive.
austen|I absolutely cannot do without music.
dickens|asked Miss Havisham, with her greedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between them, as a sign to me to sit down there.
dickens|But Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it.
austen|Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.
austen|One cannot love a reserved person.
austen|No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought afterthe very shoeroses for Netherfield were got by proxy.
austen|The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him.
austen|Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.
austen|What will it answer?
dickens|I tell you, said Jerry, that you buried pavingstones and earth in that there coffin.
austen|Mrs Westons manners, said Emma, were always particularly good.
austen|Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!
austen|Yes, good man!
dickens|I was happy, said Mr Lorry, to be entrusted with the charge.
austen|And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was very well married, to a gentleman in a great way, near Bristol, who kept two carriages!
dickens|Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.
dickens|I warnt locked up as often now as formerly, but I wore out my good share of keymetal still.
dickens|He was not improved in habits, or in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him, which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay.
dickens|Pip, said Mr Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling openly, this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.
austen|But is not this a sudden scheme?
dickens|He did not seek it, but repeated them and went on.
dickens|Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for, he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations, confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.
dickens|Ha, ha, ha!
dickens|I do, said the Jack.
dickens|How he ever did it so often without wounding himself with my knife, I dont know.
dickens|If I understand, said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, some mental shock?
dickens|There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird, said Miss Pross; and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadnt made a mistake in life.
austen|In town next week, you seeat the latest, I dare say; for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most likely they will be there tomorrow or Saturday.
austen|Assured of the love of such a womanthe disinterested love, for Jane Fairfaxs character vouches for her disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,equality of situationI mean, as far as regards society, and all the habits and manners that are important; equality in every point but oneand that one, since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.
austen|Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may have sent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to depend upon contingencies and conveniences?
dickens|And I got up behind the coach to eat mine, because she told me to.
dickens|I pass to worse news.
dickens|It doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs Pockets arm, exhibited a pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny.
dickens|It was a slip of mine.
dickens|It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, Much better, Mr Lorry said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again.
dickens|Take it in your right hand.
dickens|After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the voice replied, YesI am working.
dickens|It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the headdress of Madame Defarge.
austen|Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse.
dickens|We thought, Mr Jaggers one of the men began, pulling off his hat.
austen|He could not be persuaded that so many goodlooking houses as he saw around him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars were given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every bodys returning into their proper place the next morning.
austen|It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what she felt for him.
dickens|Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when I lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my forehead all night.
dickens|But, it was halfpast one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer.
dickens|said the lady at the table.
dickens|It was as much as I could do to assent.
dickens|I know that the longer I keep you here, the greater hope there is for my Ladybird.
dickens|Is it like him?
austen|Disputable, however, as might be the taste of such a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view which closed it extremely pretty.
austen|However, it was an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr and Mrs Weston a great deal of pleasure.
dickens|And will continue friends apart, said Estella.
dickens|Yes; for a moment.
austen|I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.
dickens|Can they not be induced to go faster?
austen|Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well know.
dickens|That way, sir, if you please.
austen|I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must be so irksome.
austen|They had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest approbation; and Mrs Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most serviceable lightfirst, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good onewell aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr Woodhouses mind.
dickens|Then they both laughed, and began cracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.
austen|When is your turn to come?
austen|And here, instead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.
dickens|On his asking me if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he begged my leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned with a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar.
dickens|Such is the profession!
dickens|I believe you!
dickens|Besides them three gentlemen that I have named, I dont call to mind another since about eleven oclock, when a stranger asked for you.
dickens|My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed for money by more than one creditor.
dickens|Thats what I told you not to do, said Mr Jaggers.
austen|But does Lydia know nothing of this?
austen|Shall I?
austen|said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.
dickens|Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor.
austen|Upon my word, Emma.
dickens|Over the prisoners head there was a mirror, to throw the light down upon him.
dickens|I lived rough, that you should live smooth; I worked hard, that you should be above work.
dickens|Show Concord!
austen|Read it aloud, said their father, for I hardly know myself what it is about.
austen|When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon of the very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal to any exercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage, she could have no doubtputting every thing togetherthat Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from her.
austen|Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.
dickens|He always carried I have not yet mentioned it, I think a pockethandkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was of great value to him in his profession.
austen|Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!
austen|Let her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may be a parlourboarder at Mrs Goddards all the rest of her lifeor, at least, for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other, till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old writingmasters son.
austen|The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.
dickens|Young Jerry, dress yourself, my boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call.
dickens|Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly, and teach me how to be a little more useful.
dickens|Apparently it must be.
austen|She was the first to announce it to Mr Knightley; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary, or, being acting a part, perhaps rather more, at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away.
austen|So very good of them to send her the whole way!
austen|He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied  Just as you please.
austen|The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table and Mr Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs Phillips.
dickens|Theyre curiosities.
austen|Every other part of her mind was disgusting.
dickens|I could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether undefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me.
austen|I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.
austen|They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.
dickens|After a pause, I hinted,  There was a question just now, Mr Jaggers, which you desired me to waive for a moment.
dickens|Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money.
dickens|I call upon you, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.
austen|But perhaps you would like to read it.
dickens|It and I have worn away together.
austen|Have you indeed no idea?
dickens|Colonel, to you!
austen|But I thought you would.
dickens|Expressive signs of what made them poor, were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.
austen|They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astleys.
dickens|The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninetytwo was come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.
dickens|I had begun by asking questions, and I was going to rob Mrs Joe.
dickens|For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and when I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of her as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day.
austen|How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!
dickens|And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house, and for the senseless stones that made their pavements.
austen|Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful.
dickens|I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the brewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my face with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate.
austen|A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, or neither.
dickens|And it was donewhy, how old are you?
austen|These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs Weston, of a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.
dickens|When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and Mrs Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked it never was at any other time for the company to enter by, and everything most splendid.
austen|Mrs Weston again, and again, and again, you see.
austen|The party did not supply much conversation.
austen|Some time afterwards it was, I think Mrs Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened.
austen|Not quite.
austen|When she became sensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings.
dickens|He turned it about in his mouth much longer than usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like a pill.
austen|Emma will be happy to entertain you.
austen|Mr Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner decidedly graver than usual, said,  I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare, and therefore must now be gone directly.
dickens|when his face clears, as he looks into the third.
dickens|I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and wholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing beggar my neighbor by candlelight in the room with the stopped clocks, and being despised by Estella.
dickens|Well?
austen|With three younger sisters grown up, replied Elizabeth, smiling, your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.
austen|she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr Elton.
dickens|I thank you very gratefully.
dickens|Also, the spoon is not generally used overhand, but under.
austen|Never better.
dickens|More than that; Im going to take a walk.
dickens|Never you trouble your head about this man, retorted the contentious Mr Cruncher; youll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman.
dickens|Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.
dickens|This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside me.
dickens|Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, What do you mean?
dickens|With those words, he released mewhich I was glad of, for his hand smelt of scented soapand went his way downstairs.
dickens|There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together.
dickens|Are you there?
austen|But your family owe me nothing.
austen|Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.
austen|Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.
austen|They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.
dickens|When Mr Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the post, and had paid me my money from a cashbox in a safe, the key of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his coatcollar like an ironpigtail, we went upstairs.
austen|Frank was next to Emma, Jane opposite to themand Mr Knightley so placed as to see them all; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little apparent observation.
dickens|Bravo!
austen|She wentshe had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.
austen|But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.
dickens|He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his sideperhaps taking his armit was a pursuer to shun.
dickens|She quickly brought them down and handed them in;and immediately afterwards leaned against the doorpost, knitting, and saw nothing.
dickens|Why, so I must have been, for you have grown quite thin and pale!
austen|It might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.
austen|Mr Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very sure there must be a lady in the case, and he told him so; and Mr Elton only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.
austen|Delightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every thingand Mrs Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.
austen|I assure you, madam, he replied, that she does not need such advice.
dickens|The arrival of his breakfast roused him, and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it  I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time today.
austen|The decree is issued by somebody.
dickens|Let me look.
dickens|O dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I see you again, with your muscular blacksmiths arm before your eyes, and your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away.
dickens|Now, Handel, Herbert replied, in his gay, hopeful way, it seems to me that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into our gifthorses mouth with a magnifyingglass.
dickens|Its not that, said he, but she charged him, in the presence of her intended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon her for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would look trueeven to himand even to her.
dickens|Shall colonists have their horses and blood uns, if you please, good Lord!
dickens|Lord bless you, sir, well we knows that!
dickens|Now, Handel,in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?
dickens|said the sergeant, staring at Joe.
dickens|Dolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe of my halfholiday.
dickens|I am an old student here.
austen|Every thing turns out for his good.
austen|Happy couple!
dickens|Not stumbling on the means after all, I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to come with his lantern.
dickens|Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry ways.
austen|You will like Harriet.
dickens|Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her eyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.
austen|I am sure Lizzy will be very happyI am sure she can have no objection.
dickens|demanded Joe.
austen|Indeed!
dickens|On one of them, which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble, and the letter E.
dickens|However, I come here some time since you left.
austen|Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.
dickens|I fell asleep recalling what I used to do when I was at Miss Havishams; as though I had been there weeks or months, instead of hours; and as though it were quite an old subject of remembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day.
dickens|Beyond that, I have nothing.
dickens|Man, man!
dickens|Oh dear yes!
austen|Poor Wickham!
dickens|Sometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped.
austen|You are so kind!
dickens|Yes, yes, yes, returned Mr Lorry, drying his eyes, you are right.
austen|Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brothers conversation with Miss Bennet.
austen|she cried in evident embarrassment, it all meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves.
austen|Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away.
dickens|Biddy said never a single word.
austen|Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.
austen|He might be able to join them in the evening, but certainly not to dinner.
dickens|Do you not believe it is the truth?
dickens|Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time.
austen|How angry and how diverted he would be!
dickens|I will name no names, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have seen that man.
austen|Two months must bring it to the proof.
dickens|Me, a married woman!
austen|Oh yes!
dickens|Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?
austen|With the greatest respect, and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.
dickens|Put your hands to them; put your will to them.
dickens|Two one pound notes.
dickens|In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement, and out upon the miredeep roads.
dickens|As I am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing my way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing the description of our usual manners and customs at Barnards Inn.
austen|How do you like my trimming?
austen|I am the happiest creature in the world.
austen|I thought we never should have got into the coach.
dickens|Guilty, of course?
dickens|Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way Defarge spoke, Mr Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the courtyard.
dickens|Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere.
austen|But there may be pretty good guessing.
dickens|One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went a little way down the street before me, that they might turn, as if they had forgotten something, and pass me face to face,on which occasions I dont know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they of not doing it, or I of not seeing it.
dickens|Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joes restoring touch was on my shoulder.
dickens|Now my young friend, my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the box, I am going to have a word or two with you.
austen|It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.
austen|thought Elizabeth.
dickens|No.
dickens|Even yet I could not recall a single feature, but I knew him!
dickens|Monseigneur, I looked at the man.
austen|Emma continued,  I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk less of Mr Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than my comfort, a habit of selfcommand in you, a consideration of what is your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health and credit, and restore your tranquillity.
dickens|Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather than originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of our dispositions out of us.
dickens|The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the usual watch was set, and Mr Cruncher and his son went home to tea.
austen|Mr Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.
austen|But, alas!
austen|I am, dear sir, etc.
dickens|Such was my purpose.
dickens|Mr Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the Doctors room.
dickens|You must come alone.
austen|She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield.
austen|Might not the evening end in a dance?
dickens|Let him ware them, when no man cant find a rag of his dear relations clothes, nor yet a bone of his body.
dickens|This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work.
dickens|Let go of my coat.
austen|In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young manone who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smilesMr Knightley.
austen|But where is the advantage of a house of her own?
austen|With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him.
dickens|Jewellers account, I think.
austen|Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly.
dickens|Dont tell Her of this interview, or this arrangement.
austen|Yes, yesbut I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings.
austen|I am sure Mr Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.
dickens|Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pitythat had a flush of pride in it.
austen|The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr Woodhouse had been always felt in her husbands plans and her own, for a marriage between Frank and Emma.
austen|My father and Maria are coming to me in March, added Charlotte, and I hope you will consent to be of the party.
austen|She had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges.
dickens|You take it smoothly now, said I, but you were very serious last night, when you swore it was Death.
dickens|Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamers time, which would be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off early in the morning, was the question we discussed.
dickens|Bound out of hand.
dickens|Very curious indeed!
dickens|She then smiled upon me in an absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of orangeflower water?
dickens|Ah me!
austen|How very pleasing and proper of him!
austen|Charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.
austen|and the charade!
dickens|Even as it is  Even as it was, she could not command her voice.
dickens|I lay in that separate building across the courtyard.
austen|Those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs Forster called her, and they were going off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learntfor her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.
dickens|Shes a coming!
dickens|You dont eat em, returned Mr Pumblechook, sighing and nodding his head several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall.
dickens|As a wife and mother, cried Lucie, most earnestly, I implore you to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf.
dickens|You didnt mean it, remarked the matteroffact Miss Pross, and therefore how could you know it?
dickens|Being besought to go to him and dress the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies of their victims.
dickens|See the old villain bound with ropes.
austen|There was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs Perry drank tea with Mrs and Miss Bates, or when Mrs and Miss Bates returned the visit.
dickens|I am afraid of it, she answered, shuddering.
dickens|I had done so, and was looking along the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure in it.
dickens|But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and selfreproachful now than I can tell you.
dickens|You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank you with all my heart, and will open all my heartor nearly so.
austen|But it is even so.
dickens|Have you recognised him, monsieur?
austen|It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.
austen|The word was blunder; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was a blush on Janes cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible.
austen|When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?
dickens|When I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlicks nostrils, which was neither expressive nor ornamental.
dickens|This is a gay figure, Pip, said she, making her crutch stick play round me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were bestowing the finishing gift.
austen|His words seemed to imply it.
austen|You have sense, and we all expect you to use it.
dickens|It would be chance work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such circumstances, because its a tossup between two results.
austen|But I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me!
dickens|They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close company with it.
dickens|On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he dropped his daughters hand and clasped his head again.
austen|There is no danger of your not being intelligible, which is the first thing.
dickens|The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather like a larger dogkennel.
austen|Time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends again.
dickens|On the present festive occasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going, the picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials.
dickens|However, this is not London talk.
dickens|No, Mr Carton.
dickens|The figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced.
austen|With such a woman he has a chance.
austen|Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.
dickens|We had all shaken hands cordially, and neither Herberts eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I saw a fouroared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way ahead of us, and row out into the same track.
austen|That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.
dickens|much sympathy and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.
dickens|I think so.
austen|She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, Oh!
dickens|I took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one.
austen|A little upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr E.
austen|I should like balls infinitely better, she replied, if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.
austen|Well girls, said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, What say you to the day?
austen|No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame.
austen|To give up ones child!
dickens|But didnt you never think it might be me?
dickens|I have saved him.
austen|But do come in.
dickens|How little I thought what I was doing!
dickens|And you go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then there you are!
dickens|As he replied in the affirmative, with perfect confidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until the day was wearing away.
austen|And what sort of table do they keep?
dickens|It is the strangest thing, said Mr Wopsle, drifting into his lost look again; and yet I could swear to him.
austen|I do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice, said she.
austen|Mr Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused.
austen|yes, I observed it, I assure you.
austen|An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.
dickens|Herbert shrugged his shoulders.
dickens|He gloated over every abhorrent adjective in the description, and identified himself with every witness at the Inquest.
dickens|In any of the burialplaces of this city through which I pass, is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?
dickens|Missis, returned the gallant sergeant, speaking for myself, I should reply, the honor and pleasure of his fine wifes acquaintance; speaking for the king, I answer, a little job done.
dickens|I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about to return to him!
dickens|I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here.
dickens|From information I have received, said he, looking round at us as we all quailed before him, I have reason to believe there is a blacksmith among you, by name Josephor JoeGargery.
austen|The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied.
dickens|But in a fatal moment, yielding to those propensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance, and had come back to the country where he was proscribed.
austen|Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination, said Elizabeth.
austen|It is my party.
dickens|Mr Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips.
austen|He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always chuse the same.
dickens|Mind!
austen|Yes, upon my word, very considerable.
dickens|You will show yourself to us; wont you?
dickens|In the church and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its foot.
dickens|Then she glanced in a casual manner round the wineshop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit, and became absorbed in it.
dickens|Anyhow, Mr Wopsles Roman nose so aggravated me, during the recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it until he howled.
austen|He gave her a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he had met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.
austen|I have no such injuries to resent.
austen|His weddingday was named.
dickens|Neither did she ever give me any money,or anything but my daily dinner,nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my services.
austen|How Jane could bear it at all, was astonishing to Emma.
dickens|I was rather on the lookout for good fortune then.
dickens|One would have supposed that it was I who was in danger, not he, and that he was reassuring me.
austen|After the first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began with,  I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.
dickens|How often?
dickens|More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory; but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these.
austen|His sense of her inferiorityof its being a degradationof the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.
dickens|growled the journeyman, between his teeth, Id hold you, if you was my wife.
austen|This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfieldthe more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.
austen|And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.
austen|I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does marry;I mean, as to being acquainted with his wifefor though his sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice.
dickens|Fluttering hopes and doubtshopes, of a love as yet unknown to her doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delightdivided her breast.
austen|South End is prohibited, if you please.
dickens|Knew no more about the lists?
austen|This is a connexion which offers nothing but good.
austen|Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama.
austen|He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.
dickens|Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!
dickens|Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not harsh nor cruel.
dickens|The sawyer himself did not participate in the conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.
austen|The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.
dickens|First, notwithstanding the proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set your mind at rest that these people never willnever would, in hundred yearsimpair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great or small.
dickens|That I was ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come down to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one.
austen|But I have always observed, that they who are goodnatured when children, are goodnatured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetesttempered, most generoushearted boy in the world.
austen|Oh no;and it is but a short letter too.
austen|But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.
austen|The idea of the olivebranch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.
austen|He had better not be in a hurry.
dickens|I know nothing of his life.
dickens|Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of men were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of Heaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no farewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to me, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my miserable errors,still, if I could have killed him, even in dying, I would have done it.
dickens|Well!
dickens|You cost me that place.
austen|I have not been working uninterruptedly, he replied, I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily, it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe.
austen|Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield?
austen|If your master would marry, you might see more of him.
austen|said Emma, still perplexed.
austen|do you recommend this side?
austen|Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.
austen|An arch look expressedI understand you well enough; but she said only, Miss Fairfax is reserved.
dickens|But that poor dream, as I once used to call it, has all gone by, Biddy,all gone by!
dickens|We took our leave early, and left together.
austen|Yes, said he, smilingand reason good.
austen|Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand her.
dickens|The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain, squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village.
austen|cried he, turning towards her.
austen|Such another scheme, composed of so many illassorted people, she hoped never to be betrayed into again.
dickens|Ill think of it, said Sydney.
austen|Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End.
dickens|Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two sech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects.
austen|And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.
austen|Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl.
austen|And yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.
austen|I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be.
austen|She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.
austen|You may depend upon my seeking no further.
austen|Ought to refuse him!
dickens|With a sigh of great compassion.
dickens|That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper.
austen|A situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moments notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly.
dickens|Dont do it!
dickens|I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this monosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I accidentally held our PrayerBook upside down, that it seemed to suit his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right.
austen|Mr Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public.
austen|, but heat was intolerableand he sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mr Woodhouses fire, looking very deplorable.
dickens|Giless, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way.
dickens|He opened it in the light of the coachlamp on that side, and readfirst to himself and then aloud Wait at Dover for Mamselle.
dickens|Compliments, I said.
dickens|The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, There is a case of medicines here; and brought it from a closet, and put it on the table.
dickens|The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow, though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness.
austen|In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and conditioning, they loud and insolent.
dickens|She came out here, he said, looking about him, turned this way, must have trod on these stones often.
dickens|It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and dropping to pieces.
austen|That is exactly what I should have supposed of you, said Elizabeth.
dickens|Honore, he said.
austen|cried Elizabeth.
austen|Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this relicI knew nothing of that till this momentbut the cutting the finger, and my recommending courtplaister, and saying I had none about me!
dickens|I was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound through the gate, And sixteen?
dickens|These crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching them from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.
dickens|Another sable warder a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a wager opened the door, and showed me into the best parlor.
austen|Such elegance and profusion!
dickens|All we think, here, is how to live.
dickens|That he had watched the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from France by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out, was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in France that might impeach him for it.
dickens|It was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a dim horizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great floating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed stranded and still.
dickens|No, he acquiesced I heard it had happened very lately.
austen|Miss Darcy, on her brothers entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.
austen|I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents.
austen|The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and meand my caro sposo walking by.
austen|But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachmentwhether there were no actual preferenceremained a little longer doubtful.
dickens|The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled, was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder, yielded the sensation.
dickens|The spectators dropped off to get refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat down.
dickens|As she did so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits.
austen|Elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce.
dickens|Mr Barsad, he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer, so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name.
dickens|After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it.
dickens|You should be.
austen|Every body is lazy!
austen|But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr Eltons only objection, and Mr Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction.
austen|I am afraid we must be running away, said Emma, glancing at Harriet, and beginning to riseMy father will be expecting us.
austen|I must get rid of every thing.
austen|A man at his agewhat is he?
austen|How can you be so silly, cried her mother, as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt!
dickens|I hope you care to live?
austen|He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.
dickens|If you would like to hear, Joe I was beginning, when Joe got up and came to my sofa.
austen|I wonder what he can be doing there.
austen|She was reminded, more than once, of having always said she would never marry, and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.
austen|Jamess.
austen|I thank you for my share of the favour, said Elizabeth; but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.
dickens|But you said to me, returned Estella, very earnestly, God bless you, God forgive you!
dickens|Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection.
austen|He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter.
austen|Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation.
austen|A person may be proud without being vain.
austen|As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner  You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.
dickens|If it had been otherwise; the hand was at the prisoners face; I should but have had so much the more to answer for.
austen|In understanding, Darcy was the superior.
austen|Here are seven of you, besides myself, who, she is pleased to say, am very entertaining already, and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeatedor two things moderately cleveror three things very dull indeed, and she engages to laugh heartily at them all.
dickens|In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken Herberts expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make no such proposal to him.
austen|A single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable old maid!
dickens|Affianced, he explained, still busy with the fruit.
dickens|Is he never robbed?
austen|And now, Miss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again.
dickens|What for, Joe?
austen|cried Emma, after a moments pauseWhat do you mean?
dickens|Who?
dickens|The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come here to realise.
dickens|Here I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,Provis no longer,who had received some very severe injury in the Chest, and a deep cut in the head.
austen|The Box Hill party had decided him on going away.
austen|As to her younger daughters, she could not take upon her to sayshe could not positively answerbut she did not know of any prepossession; her eldest daughter, she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.
austen|The preparations must take their time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertaintyat the riskin her opinion, the great risk, of its being all in vain.
austen|Poor Isabella!
austen|The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is best observed by meals within doors.
austen|She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.
dickens|And now, said Joe, you aint that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor one additional shovelful today.
dickens|You think that her father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?
austen|Miss Smith, pray take care.
austen|Mrs Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card.
austen|Better pass it off as a joke.
austen|the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views!
austen|She suspected that it had; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had not been in vain.
austen|You and I must positively exert our authority.
austen|Yes.
austen|But gracious me!
dickens|It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so dreadful.
austen|So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great.
austen|How odd you are!
austen|None at all.
dickens|I might have been an unfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched up by these moral goads.
dickens|And necessarily, she added, in a haughty tone; what was fit company for you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.
dickens|You might ha done worse.
dickens|repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.
austen|I am extremely happy.
dickens|She goes next before himis gone; the knittingwomen count TwentyTwo.
dickens|No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have left me alone.
dickens|Miss Manette  Is well, said the Doctor, as he stopped short, and your return will delight us all.
dickens|This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge.
austen|I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to give her your arm.
austen|I should certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.
austen|She had no difficulty in procuring Isabellas invitation; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without resorting to invention.
dickens|Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn.
dickens|The miserable shop of the woodsawyer was so small, that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend.
dickens|Hope has quite departed from my breast.
austen|But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive daughter.
austen|Hush!
dickens|I will remember them.
austen|But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day.
austen|I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken.
dickens|I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle.
dickens|Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark, thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression!
austen|You deserve no such attention.
austen|I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs Campbell.
austen|On your side, my love, it was very innocently done.
austen|Better wait an hour or two, or even half a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your cough again.
dickens|Im a goingas your mother knowsa fishing.
austen|A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr Bennet was firm.
austen|Mrs Eltons resources were inadequate to such an attack.
dickens|No.
dickens|Now, my dear Manette, said Mr Lorry, at length, in his most considerate and most affectionate way, I am a mere man of business, and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters.
dickens|One Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed himself on being most awful dull, that I had given him up for the day, I lay on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying traces of Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the sky and in the water, until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them that had been much in my head.
dickens|I asked.
dickens|said Joe, after coughing behind his hand, as if he had had time to catch the whoopingcough since he came.
austen|Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingleys way.
dickens|Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still trees, and poured its radiance over the hill.
austen|But I will not repine.
dickens|This man, whom he had seen upon the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the Defarges, man and wife.
dickens|Biddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that were coming out, were blurred in my own sight.
dickens|demanded the traveller.
dickens|Darkness had fallen on him in its place.
dickens|Thats about it.
dickens|That depends.
dickens|I cried.
austen|Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude.
dickens|said I.
dickens|Hes always so high.
austen|Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herselfvery ill in many ways,but it was not so much his behaviour as her own, which made her so angry with him.
dickens|I do it because its politic; I do it on principle.
austen|I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily; but I made excuses for her, and was too busy, andmay I add?
dickens|When you told me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her the first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed.
dickens|The burialplace had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might have come down, for anything that could be seen of it.
austen|I hope she is right.
dickens|As Joe got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt.
dickens|As I put the window open and stood looking out, I saw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or two in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and light it for him.
dickens|Monseigneur!
dickens|He says, no varnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you put on, the more the grain will express itself.
austen|The smile was returned as Jane answered,  You are very right; it has been thought of.
austen|In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.
austen|Neither Mr Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things!
austen|It was a rational scheme, to be sure!
dickens|True, sir.
dickens|This really is a very bad side of human nature!
dickens|But I was too much bewildered between breathless curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.
dickens|Pastime, said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly.
dickens|Now burn.
austen|Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.
dickens|By degrees, Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened into a postoffice again.
dickens|I had stopped to look at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked windows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with its twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich attractive mystery, of which I was the hero.
austen|When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?
austen|Mr Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.
dickens|You know, old chap, said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs Joe, with his bite still in his cheek, I Bolted, myself, when I was your agefrequentand as a boy Ive been among a many Bolters; but I never see your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and its a mercy you aint Bolted dead.
dickens|I never was so much surprised in all my life,couldnt credit my own ed,to tell you the truth, hardly believed it were my own ed.
austen|One must speak a little, you know.
dickens|In your reception of it, dont heed me any more than if I was a speaking machinetruly, I am not much else.
austen|Look!
dickens|It is true what madame says, observed Jacques Three.
dickens|It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.
austen|We may well say that our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.
dickens|Physical diseases, engendered in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees; and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering, intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally without distinction.
austen|Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.
dickens|The quartering one, eh?
dickens|Roaring dryer, soaring higherOld Clem!
austen|She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.
austen|I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point.
dickens|They tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more.
dickens|Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts.
dickens|The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold.
austen|I dont say that it is not a disagreeable businessbut things might be much worse.
austen|and she was made such a fuss with by every body!
dickens|As I was saying, Pip, it were my intentions to have had it cut over him; but poetry costs money, cut it how you will, small or large, and it were not done.
dickens|Yes, I am very much put out.
dickens|The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance.
austen|Frank Churchill was a villain.
austen|She heard him sigh.
dickens|These I steeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I dont know what for Estella.
dickens|Again, not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a rise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it, this is the time to mention it.
dickens|On the contrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his hands to me.
dickens|Biddy, said I, how do you manage it?
dickens|In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees, and then Mr Wemmick, backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced, said, its no use, my boy.
dickens|Well, said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in anywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipes,wellno.
dickens|I can only suppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man, habitually to deceive his own instruments.
austen|Oh!
austen|You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.
dickens|Ah!
austen|All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.
dickens|Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnards Inn.
dickens|My reason is to be found in what took place in Mr Pumblechooks parlor where, on our presenting ourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.
dickens|I whispered Herbert.
dickens|I knew him before he gave me one of those aids, though, a moment before, I had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity.
austen|Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.
austen|we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!
austen|But if I do, I shall be crosser still.
austen|I never heard that it was.
austen|She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion.
dickens|We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr Wopsle; but they were too hopeless to be persisted in.
dickens|Joe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and looked at me again.
dickens|My sister, Mrs Joe, throwing the door wide open, and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause, and applied Tickler to its further investigation.
dickens|Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light from the misty yellow rooms?
austen|or thereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightful rapiditythe first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so gloriousthe steps so quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr Greens, and the party at Mrs Brownssmiles and blushes rising in importancewith consciousness and agitation richly scatteredthe lady had been so easily impressedso sweetly disposedhad in short, to use a most intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him, that vanity and prudence were equally contented.
dickens|asked Mr Cruncher.
austen|She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcys breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.
austen|Mr Eltons situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.
austen|They were natural and just.
austen|Before this second looking over was begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments free observation of the entrance and groundplot of the houseand was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of escape.
austen|I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend.
dickens|Doing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old chimneypiece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes.
austen|No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard.
dickens|Or girl, suggested Mr Hubble.
dickens|You will do him no harm.
dickens|Know him!
austen|Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manhe is a great friend of Darcys.
austen|That may be done without horses.
dickens|How do you call the man?
austen|Jane Fairfax did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the mortification of having lovedyes, of having loved even Mr Elton in vainby the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend.
austen|I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.
dickens|You seeSydney Carton, an Englishman?
dickens|Bust em, and youll bust fiveandthirty shillings.
dickens|It was nothing to her, that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live.
austen|She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.
austen|Yes, said he, smiling.
dickens|And there, my sister was laid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.
dickens|Mr Jaggers worked that in this way We say these are not marks of fingernails, but marks of brambles, and we show you the brambles.
dickens|Lying hidden in her bosom, was a loaded pistol.
austen|DEAR SIR,  I must trouble you once more for congratulations.
austen|To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.
dickens|Person with him!
austen|That is all to be forgot.
dickens|But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a churchtower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison.
dickens|Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and dont move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!
dickens|Mr Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.
austen|Did you see her often at Weymouth?
dickens|Its altogether out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual heap of streets great and small.
austen|By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.
austen|Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and Mrs Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return?
austen|I hope she caught no cold last night.
austen|my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!
dickens|An urgent case in the Rue St.
dickens|I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere.
austen|I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.
austen|I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse.
dickens|Mr Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where suppliants for Mr Jaggerss notice were lingering about as usual, and I returned to my watch in the street of the coachoffice, with some three hours on hand.
dickens|This is a pretty thing, Belinda!
dickens|Well, Pip, you know, replied Joe, as if that were a little unreasonable, you yourself see me put em in my at, and therefore you know as they are here.
austen|That very dear part of Emma, her fancy, received an amusing supply.
austen|The weather continued much the same all the following morning; and the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at Hartfieldbut in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was summer again.
austen|The weather added what it could of gloom.
dickens|The same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before, and tomorrow and the day after.
austen|There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else.
dickens|She was pretty enough to have been married long ago.
dickens|Would Gargery come here with you, and bring your indentures, do you think?
austen|You have made her too tall, Emma, said Mr Knightley.
dickens|He was well acquainted, moreover, with the circumstances of his country, and those were of evergrowing interest.
dickens|I had little objection to his being seen by Herbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held in contempt.
austen|Colonel Fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out.
dickens|Firstly, because, on fine Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie; secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the Doctors household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them.
dickens|A young ladys walking shoe, he muttered, without looking up.
austen|After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thoughtreconsidering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.
austen|She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feedingto appear in the ungracious character of the one preferredand acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and misjudging in all her ideas on one subject, all her observations, all her convictions, all her prophecies for the last six weeks.
austen|How very odd!
austen|To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart.
dickens|The maidenly bosom bared to this, the pretty almostchilds head thus distracted, the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of the disjointed time.
austen|They were all three walking about together for an hour or twofirst round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury.
dickens|Some of em writes my letters when I wants em wrote,do you mind?
dickens|The men were terrible, in the bloodyminded anger with which they looked from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest.
dickens|A rumour just lived in the villagehad a faint and bare existence there, as its people hadthat when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever.
dickens|It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to Herbert also, that he might be best got away across the water, on that pretence,as, to make purchases, or the like.
austen|He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.
austen|As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.
dickens|asked Miss Pross.
dickens|Youre too late, said Mr Jaggers.
austen|If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.
austen|A straightforward, openhearted man like Weston, and a rational, unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their own concerns.
dickens|He spoke in a slushy voice, as if much mud had washed into his throat.
austen|But you really frightened me.
dickens|Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding Tellsons.
austen|As she reflected more, she seemed but to feel it more.
dickens|said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.
austen|Sir, you quite misunderstand me, said Mrs Bennet, alarmed.
dickens|The number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change in him than I had seen yet.
austen|For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself.
dickens|But I like the fellow, Pip; he is one of the true sort.
dickens|When the shadows of evening were closing in, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a little talk.
dickens|I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove them.
dickens|But its not my business.
dickens|Her mind pursued them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more.
dickens|The Aged must have been stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his bedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.
austen|She thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest.
austen|How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?
dickens|Miss Estella.
austen|yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkinss weeks account; much rather, I confess.
austen|This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings.
austen|She must not appear to think it a misfortune.
dickens|What is it?
austen|This cardroom would be wanted as a cardroom now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable supper?
austen|; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.
dickens|That persons name?
austen|It will pass away soon enough.
austen|She could not compose herself Mr Woodhouse would be alarmedshe had better go;with most ready encouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through another doorand the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous burst of Emmas feelings Oh God!
dickens|Come!
dickens|He took out his key and opened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and little used.
dickens|According to its nature.
dickens|Be gooddeserve itand abide by Mr Jaggerss instructions.
dickens|At first, a misgiving crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his employment; but it melted as I saw Mr Jaggers relax into something like a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.
dickens|At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
austen|I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself.
dickens|But, the other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner with his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers.
dickens|Then, that is why it makes me wretched.
austen|Both, replied Elizabeth archly; for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.
austen|He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.
dickens|Ay, ay!
dickens|We have borne this a long time, said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes again upon Lucie.
dickens|Then, all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you bring to him, begin.
dickens|Somebody has been attacked and hurt.
austen|Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself?
austen|If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.
dickens|I shall not tell you.
dickens|To hear him!
dickens|That, he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise.
dickens|He paced up and down for a long time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he fell asleep.
austen|Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey, and his fears that Mr Elton might never get safely to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language.
dickens|He nodded when I said the subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the wine again, and went on with his dinner.
dickens|Hallo you!
dickens|Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay very ill in bed.
dickens|It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the street.
dickens|And whenever I caught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly and they often looked at me,particularly Biddy, I felt offended as if they were expressing some mistrust of me.
austen|Notill Cole alluded to my supposed attachment, it had never entered my head.
austen|A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr Darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudencein short anything or nothing.
austen|When Miss Smiths and Mr Eltons get acquaintedthey do indeedand really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently, so palpably desirablewhat courts the prearrangement of other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.
dickens|After looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gave up that point.
austen|The good sense of Colonel and Mrs Campbell could not oppose such a resolution, though their feelings did.
dickens|But I took him into the room I had just left, and, having set the lamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could to explain himself.
dickens|Dinnertime, and still no Hundreds of people.
dickens|For the reason that my hand had this effect I assume, I had sat by the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on, before the elder said  There is another patient.
austen|She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness.
austen|It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a halfhours acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.
dickens|On the understanding, again and again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr Jaggers tomorrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my hurts looked after, and to stay at home.
austen|The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.
austen|that abominable Mr Darcy!
dickens|The waiter appeared to be particularly affected.
dickens|said the elder, when I went in.
austen|The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be saidmuch praise and many commentsundoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerably;but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin.
austen|No, no; I feel he may defy us there.
dickens|Mindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men who went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better words that I could say beside his bed, than O Lord, be merciful to him a sinner!
austen|I hope he will not mind it so very much.
austen|Emmas remark was  There it is.
austen|I met him just now.
dickens|The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty.
austen|But the idea of any thing to be done in a moment, was increasing, not lessening, Mr Woodhouses agitation.
dickens|I follow.
dickens|There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France.
austen|So unlike what a man should be!
dickens|The floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag.
dickens|You are a noble heart.
dickens|said I.
dickens|People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State, yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were no less abundant.
austen|Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.
dickens|This watching of me at my chambers which I have once had reason to suspect, I said to Wemmick when he came back, is inseparable from the person to whom you have adverted; is it?
dickens|I have learnt next to nothing, Joe.
dickens|Now, thats the way with them here, Mr Pip, remarked Wemmick, turning to me with his postoffice elongated.
austen|His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr Darcys sister, as by Wickhams account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.
dickens|There was a blank silence.
dickens|And drew a long breath.
dickens|Biddy, dont you hear me?
austen|You supposed more than really existed.
austen|She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.
dickens|, Joe?
austen|You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him.
dickens|O sisterwoman, think of me.
austen|Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.
dickens|Put the case that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.
dickens|Biddy, who was the most obliging of girls, immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her promise within five minutes.
dickens|You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people, said Estella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once grave and rallying, for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and insinuations to your disadvantage.
dickens|I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with our eyes.
dickens|Not another word had I heard to enlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twentythird birthday was a week gone.
dickens|But this Doctor has suffered much; you have seen him today; you have observed his face when the paper was read.
austen|Oh!
dickens|Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?
dickens|They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep.
dickens|The farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no more was done.
dickens|I think that, in the endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella.
austen|If you are very kind, said he, it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night;let me live them over again.
austen|She could fancy such a man.
dickens|All is well, Handel, said Herbert, and he is quite satisfied, though eager to see you.
dickens|Well or ill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.
dickens|The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.
dickens|That did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and confidence at that time, I had known her something less than five minutes; if they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.
austen|She plays and sings all day long.
dickens|The Spy returned immediately, with two men.
austen|When they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very delightfully!
dickens|Listen once again then, Jacques!
austen|very true indeed.
austen|People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families.
austen|Lord bless me!
austen|He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued  I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, She a beauty!
dickens|At the end of the passage, while the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason of me.
dickens|They watch you, misrepresent you, write letters about you anonymous sometimes, and you are the torment and the occupation of their lives.
austen|It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences.
austen|Elizabeth smiled.
dickens|As we came nearer to the shouting, it became more and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice.
austen|As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.
dickens|Change these back again to what they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my fathers house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants!
austen|She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.
dickens|Thats not so bad, said the sergeant, reflecting; even if I was forced to halt here nigh two hours, thatll do.
austen|What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand!
dickens|Her expression air then as follering Mr Gargery.
austen|If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.
dickens|The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road.
dickens|I drink to the Republic.
austen|As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.
dickens|They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had brought to the door, and bent to carry it away.
austen|Oh, no!
austen|Her situation should secure your compassion.
dickens|Or do you mean that I shall strike you dead?
dickens|Gargery!
dickens|Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my creditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be quite recovered.
dickens|And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr and Mrs Pockets children were not growing up or being brought up, but were tumbling up.
austen|All the minor arrangements of table and chair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs Weston and Mrs Stokes.
austen|Mr Dixon.
austen|All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none of it.
austen|Are you much acquainted with Mr Darcy?
dickens|Thus it was  Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a character that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted.
dickens|She never missed before, says a knittingwoman of the sisterhood.
austen|Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that people should like her so much.
dickens|Hears?
austen|papathat is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do not think you ever will.
dickens|Estella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down at the fire.
dickens|I should be, if I believed what you said just now, I replied, to turn it off.
austen|She did not really like her.
dickens|When I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, darkeyed girl, and of the motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Ropewalk had grown quite a different place.
austen|Yesrather hesitatinglyI believe I do.
austen|Well, I shall bring Jane with meJane and her aunt.
dickens|Who began it, or how fair it was, or how unfair, may be doubtful; but how it ended is certainly not doubtful, for the victim was found throttled.
austen|But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.
austen|While he staid, the Martins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned, judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martins visit.
dickens|But, not for long.
dickens|Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and there that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide; the navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a much easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.
austen|They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day.
austen|I am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.
dickens|An involuntary shudder passed over both of us.
austen|, in being unpleasant to Miss F.
austen|What are they saying about Mr Perry?
dickens|It may be that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in actionnot in words.
austen|Oh!
austen|Never, sir.
dickens|But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim and your opportunity, to sustain you.
dickens|There was a most irritating end to every one of these debates.
austen|Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr Eltons having dropt a hint.
austen|To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our objectif one could but tell what that would be.
dickens|What now?
austen|Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings.
austen|you are too scrupulous, indeed you are, cried Emma warmly, and taking her hand.
austen|My dear, did you change your stockings?
dickens|One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
austen|I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous.
dickens|Nothing at all, Joe.
dickens|Do you start for Paris from here?
austen|The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind.
dickens|The sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for another glass.
dickens|I dont take to Philip, said he, smiling, for it sounds like a moral boy out of the spellingbook, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond, or so fat that he couldnt see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that he locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a birdsnesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the neighborhood.
dickens|At last, the old woman and the niece came in,the latter with a head not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom,and testified surprise at sight of me and the fire.
dickens|Carton!
austen|Yes, my dear, if there is time.
dickens|I determined to ask Joe why he had ever taught me to call those picturecards Jacks, which ought to be called knaves.
austen|However, now I will destroy it alland it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that you may see how rational I am grown.
austen|You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say.
dickens|And let me have none of your tricks here, said Mr Trabb, or you shall repent it, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.
austen|Thank you for rousing me, he replied.
austen|But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited  Oh!
dickens|Ten minutes, good, past eleven.
austen|That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.
dickens|You know that you are recalled to life?
austen|A word was put in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included, and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out, it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of.
dickens|I drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating to me, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any one whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a going to be bullbaited and badgered in his own place.
dickens|Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.
dickens|We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he was on board, and we were off again.
austen|Ah!
dickens|How, then!
dickens|Halloa!
dickens|I suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up; but if ever there was, the time is gone.
dickens|for I looked surprised, its not personal; its professional only professional.
dickens|Why should I call you mad, returned Estella, I, of all people?
dickens|I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner or from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered over the question whether he might have been a better man under better circumstances.
austen|Had the late Mr Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life.
austen|no, nocried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she couldUpon no account in the world.
dickens|If hes found Guilty, you mean to say?
dickens|Then, the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village, roused him.
austen|But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used.
dickens|Go and speak to Flopson.
austen|The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself; and Mrs Westons heart and time would be occupied by it.
dickens|How, then?
austen|She did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general, which made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable.
austen|Mrs Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.
dickens|In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for them at the slimewashed stairs,again heard the gruff Give way, you!
dickens|Hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand.
austen|There I was quite right.
dickens|I remember it too.
austen|There is safety in reserve, but no attraction.
dickens|Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his bedroom.
dickens|Id be a match for all noodles and all rogues, returned my sister, beginning to work herself into a mighty rage.
dickens|Then he asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend?
austen|But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?
austen|But now it was all too natural.
austen|The persons to be invited, required little thought.
dickens|I dont understand you, said I.
dickens|The phantom that my mind pursued, was another and more real child.
austen|But our visitor was very obstinate.
austen|She looked down the Randalls road.
dickens|I was a blacksmiths boy but yesterday; I amwhat shall I say I amtoday?
dickens|Mr Cruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his liberalityId catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.
austen|We will know where we have gonewe will recollect what we have seen.
austen|I should never have said Mrs Collins was settled near her family.
dickens|He could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout.
dickens|I believe, with all my soul, that we shall see the triumph.
austen|But youhow are you?
dickens|I read that just now, Mr Wopsle pleaded.
austen|I doubt its being very clever myself, said Mr Weston.
dickens|Those were the words I said.
austen|Always deceived in fact by his own wishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.
dickens|You will be sure to hear when the jury come in.
austen|I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.
dickens|You are a little late, Memory, said Stryver.
austen|Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction may be the greater.
dickens|Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread, I somehow thought of Miss Havisham and Estella; and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off, upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or waterline, it was just the same.
dickens|Although I had sent Mr Jaggers a brief account of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to give him all the details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the rules of evidence, than it had been before.
dickens|exclaimed Mr Lorry.
dickens|Good points in him, good points in him, said Cousin Raymond; Heaven forbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he never will have, any sense of the proprieties.
austen|It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight.
austen|Emma thought first of herself, and then of Harriet.
dickens|For he has been hovering about you all night.
dickens|Still in the same moment, I saw that the face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago.
austen|Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.
dickens|No, to be sure.
austen|You are too bountiful!
dickens|But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.
dickens|The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses.
dickens|He made a sudden exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the wormeaten stool and table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.
austen|Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said  I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.
dickens|And as to firing!
dickens|He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help.
austen|Mr Knightley, one moment more; something of consequenceso shocked!
austen|Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.
dickens|Of the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing, I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it fleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him cough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into large property.
austen|She was quite convinced of Mr Eltons being in the fairest way of falling in love, if not in love already.
dickens|Dn me!
austen|Indeed, replied Elizabeth, I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
dickens|Mr Jaggerss room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most dismal place; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head, and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to peep down at me through it.
austen|The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.
austen|He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father.
dickens|Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients, and how can you rightly have one without tother?
dickens|I selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr Trabbs judgment, and reentered the parlor to be measured.
dickens|I asked Estella.
dickens|I had no intention of doing it, and I am sorry for it if I did.
dickens|You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied; trusted, respected, and looked up to?
austen|He may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it.
austen|From what can it proceed?
austen|How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!
austen|I know no man more likely than Mr Knightley to do the sort of thingto do any thing really goodnatured, useful, considerate, or benevolent.
austen|Charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.
dickens|So you go tomorrow?
dickens|Blest if I know, said Jerry.
austen|I mean that he has done it, answered Mr Knightley, with smiling but determined decision, and been accepted.
dickens|This wineshop keeper was a bullnecked, martiallooking man of thirty, and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.
dickens|Aa matter of business.
dickens|said Mr Jaggers.
austen|Mrs Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.
dickens|Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him.
austen|You see how delightfully she writes.
dickens|No ceremony, he stipulated, and no dinner dress, and say tomorrow.
dickens|He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on the air.
dickens|Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage, for his sake.
austen|We are not in a way to know what Mr Bingley likes, said her mother resentfully, since we are not to visit.
austen|He has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.
austen|Yes, she will do for him very well.
austen|I must find Mr Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.
dickens|Do you doubt them?
dickens|The marriageday was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the closed door of the Doctors room, where he was speaking with Charles Darnay.
dickens|I was very much afraid of him again, now that he had worked himself into this fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping away from home any longer.
austen|Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr Knightley till after supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked.
austen|Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.
dickens|Compeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward.
dickens|And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and nearer.
dickens|It is a part of the secret which is another persons and not mine.
dickens|Its plain enough, I should think, why he may be.
dickens|Heres a note, sir.
dickens|With this view, he urged his son to hold her in conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections.
austen|He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for the weakness in little Bellas throat,both sea air and bathing.
austen|Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours.
austen|No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in French, not in English.
dickens|At the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his arms,clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,and limped towards the low church wall.
dickens|The instruments of torture!
dickens|Will you wake me, before departing?
austen|Before any answer could arrive from Mr Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge.
austen|Oh!
dickens|Perhaps.
austen|It must be a severe trial to them all.
austen|But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.
dickens|As you say, madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an extra something into his name that boded him no good.
dickens|Poor dear soul!
dickens|Pray let me hear you say the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and then I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better of me, in the time to come!
dickens|He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked.
dickens|Mr Pumblechook stood over me and poured out my teabefore I could touch the teapotwith the air of a benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.
austen|She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting on what she had said, and trying to understand the manner.
austen|that must be a very great pleasure.
dickens|Early tomorrow have your horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two oclock in the afternoon.
dickens|And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will, he added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his valet to his own bedroom.
dickens|It is more to the purpose that you say you are.
austen|Mamma, cried Lydia, my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watsons as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarkes library.
dickens|Did you ask me for my name?
dickens|It was summertime, and lovely weather.
dickens|Its himself, you know.
austen|Emma was extremely glad to see himbut there was a degree of confusiona number of embarrassing recollections on each side.
austen|Yes, he had no engagement at all for tomorrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.
dickens|retorted Mr Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with his hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on the wall behind me; how much more?
austen|We must ask Mr and Mrs Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is here.
austen|Have not I some right to complain?
austen|You are always with me.
dickens|But he is accused of it.
dickens|Proud and wilful as of old, she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that it was impossible and out of natureor I thought soto separate them from her beauty.
austen|She was not thoroughly comfortable herself.
austen|He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
dickens|The list was read, in the vaulted chamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival.
dickens|Mr Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost no time.
dickens|Yes, said a voice from the darkness beneath.
dickens|When did it strike you?
austen|and I can account for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner.
dickens|I understand how to put you in a corner, Mr Darnay, said Bully Stryver, and Ill do it.
austen|Their party in the diningroom was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other persons, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.
dickens|What the Blue Blazes is he?
dickens|Mr Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good fortune on the Doctors daughter, resolved to make her happiness known to her before he left town for the Long Vacation.
austen|Mr Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.
dickens|I could see none, I could hear none.
dickens|Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the mastery of them even in his sleep.
austen|so charming as you are!
austen|I am sure I shant get a wink of sleep all night.
austen|I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!
dickens|I answered.
dickens|Walking here again, citizeness?
dickens|Then he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight.
austen|As he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority.
dickens|Miss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?
dickens|repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile, and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.
dickens|You are fatigued.
austen|He had gone away rejected and mortifieddisappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the right lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one.
dickens|Theres more where that come from.
dickens|If that makes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a goodun.
austen|My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs Hurst were going out.
dickens|Run all!
dickens|This change had a great influence in bringing Camillas chemistry to a sudden end.
dickens|soon dried.
austen|Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own!
dickens|You know it is a capital crime, to mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine.
austen|It was first broken by Mrs Annesley, a genteel, agreeablelooking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly wellbred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.
dickens|How many more of them!
austen|Oh!
dickens|Theres all manner of things wanted, said Miss Pross, and we shall have a precious time of it.
austen|If I wished to think slightingly of anybodys children, it should not be of my own, however.
austen|A man cannot be more so, was his short, full answer.
dickens|In this respect the House was much on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable, but were only the more respectable.
austen|The Coles expressed themselves so properlythere was so much real attention in the manner of itso much consideration for her father.
austen|Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir Williams too long.
dickens|She looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her work in her hands.
dickens|You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I dont wonder at it.
dickens|Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment she appeared.
dickens|For the time being at least, I was saved.
dickens|My back was turned towards the distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the old lights away on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder.
dickens|Youre my son,more to me nor any son.
dickens|Will you answer me a single question?
dickens|No I am not, said Biddy, looking up and laughing.
austen|His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather changeable.
austen|The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr Darcy before they had known anything of the matter.
dickens|I said so, and he took me down.
dickens|How could she be!
austen|I like your plan, cried Mr Weston.
austen|Charlotte had seen them from her husbands room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding  I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.
dickens|I didnt quite mean what I said.
austen|A pleasant thank you seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh.
dickens|Two dismally absurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black bandage,as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort to anybody,were posted at the front door; and in one of them I recognized a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck with both arms.
dickens|As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him.
dickens|The sheriffs with their great chains and nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great gallery full of people,a large theatrical audience,looked on, as the twoandthirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted.
austen|Mrs Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change.
austen|It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first remark, on reading it, was that of course it must be declined, she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.
austen|Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are.
austen|I hope every body had a pleasant evening, said Mr Woodhouse, in his quiet way.
dickens|For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband.
dickens|Yes, Pip, said Joe; and whats worse, shes got Tickler with her.
austen|Your affectionate friend,  LYDIA BENNET.
dickens|Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to Herbert, My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell you.
austen|They walked thither directly.
dickens|Stay a bit.
dickens|It was soon done, and the boat was brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach her within a minute or two.
dickens|Do you play?
dickens|If it was ever intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island?
dickens|Mr Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street, and rumbled into the innyard.
austen|It was agreed to.
dickens|As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.
dickens|The time wi Compeyson was amost as hard a time as ever I had; that said, alls said.
austen|I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad.
dickens|My guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine.
dickens|For he had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he would come to breakfast with us.
dickens|I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv you the banknotes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.
dickens|Rustling about the room, his softlyslippered feet making no noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tigerlooked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just coming on.
austen|Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled!
austen|no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind tobut if you would just advise me what I had best doNo, no, I do not mean thatAs you say, ones mind ought to be quite made upOne should not be hesitatingIt is a very serious thing.
dickens|I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I wish there warnt no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it all on myself; but this is the upanddownandstraight on it, Pip, and I hope youll overlook shortcomings.
austen|Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.
dickens|said Mr Pocket, Junior.
dickens|may I?
austen|Not as you represent it.
dickens|The prisoner bent over the paper, once more.
austen|Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentlemans proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.
austen|They seem very comfortable as they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probably repent it.
austen|All were struck with the strangers air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot.
austen|The man who fetches our letters every morning one of our men, I forget his name shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you.
austen|I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss.
austen|I understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary.
austen|Why do you smile?
austen|If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs Long.
dickens|My heart is touched now, by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother and I so old!
dickens|As to you, said she, you would shout and shed tears for anything, if it made a show and a noise.
austen|While you were in the smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me.
dickens|Rot the admiration of the whole Court!
dickens|Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the fact.
austen|If this is living in the country, it is nothing very formidable.
dickens|Or another, Is that a boat yonder?
austen|His pride, said Miss Lucas, does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.
dickens|It all prospered wonderful.
dickens|I am ashamed to say it, I returned, and yet its no worse to say it than to think it.
dickens|What I think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.
dickens|The two ghastly casts on the shelf were not far from him, and their expression was as if they were making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.
dickens|Lucie asked.
austen|The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brothers in sending it.
austen|The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs Elton, from the particulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very inferior to her own.
austen|Well, said Emma, willing to let it passyou want to hear about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved charmingly.
dickens|He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his ridingcoat, and he stood at Mr Crunchers elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself.
austen|Had she left her where she ought, and where he had told her she ought!
dickens|asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding sharpness.
austen|Four oclock!
dickens|But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of a stunning and outdacious sort,alluding to them which bordered on wealcutlets and dogfighting,a sincere wellwisher would adwise, Pip, their being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed.
austen|I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!
dickens|Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in the case of a boy, that secret burden cooperates with another secret burden down the leg of his trousers, it is as I can testify a great punishment.
dickens|In seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the diseasea terrible passing inclination to die of it.
dickens|Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice  Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three!
dickens|For the fathers?
dickens|As Drummle and Startop had each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out.
austen|He had found her agitated and low.
austen|The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks.
dickens|Do so, as he wishes it, I said to Herbert.
austen|I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister.
austen|do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfaxs sensations from you, or from any body else.
dickens|He had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and head and neck and hands, before he could go on.
austen|But there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me.
dickens|To sum up, sir, said Wemmick, Mr Jaggers was altogether too many for the jury, and they gave in.
austen|He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain.
austen|There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs Westons weddingcake in their hands but Mr Woodhouse would never believe it.
austen|Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr Woodhouses carriage.
austen|And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.
austen|In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcys, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.
dickens|Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette.
dickens|Boy of the neighborhood?
dickens|Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again, Defarge said, Go on, Jacques.
austen|You could make it into two parcels, Mrs Ford, could not you?
austen|We can all begin freelya slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.
dickens|So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.
austen|A clergyman like you must marry.
dickens|His mother had died, years before.
austen|had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute the comparison.
dickens|I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it.
austen|Ah!
austen|The shade was most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.
dickens|Having had a letter from you, I were able to say I am.
austen|He had nestled down his head most conveniently.
austen|My uncle is to send a servant for us.
austen|He was often hoping, intending to comebut was always prevented.
dickens|It is a pretty sight!
austen|I promised my wife to leave it all to her.
dickens|cried my sister, casting off her bonnet in sudden desperation, here I stand talking to mere Mooncalfs, with Uncle Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catching cold at the door, and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the sole of his foot!
dickens|Very good, sir.
dickens|At Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted wi a man whose skull Id crack wi this poker, like the claw of a lobster, if Id got it on this hob.
austen|Selina has entirely given up musicnever touches the instrumentthough she played sweetly.
austen|Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.
austen|Oh no!
dickens|I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on to be his man and pardner.
dickens|Its bad enough to be a blacksmiths wife and him a Gargery without being your mother.
austen|You will stay, and go with us?
dickens|It is what I meant to say.
dickens|The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it, no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate successfully.
austen|Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.
dickens|your seventyeight years would be seventyeight heavy curses; would they not?
austen|Is it kingdom?
dickens|Shall we follow you?
austen|In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingleys, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr Darcy were by no means over.
austen|She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.
dickens|Let us stretch the hour or two.
dickens|I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter.
dickens|Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay and stand or fall by!
austen|He wrote last week to hurry my return.
dickens|God bless you!
dickens|And Id have swum off, towing him by the hair, if it had come to that, and Id a got him aboard without the soldiers.
dickens|He turned into the Temple, and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of Kings Benchwalk and Paperbuildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.
dickens|Being made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.
austen|Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.
austen|MY DEAR NIECE,  I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you.
dickens|Thus, Doctor Manette.
dickens|As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls.
dickens|If I could only get myself to fall in love with you,you dont mind my speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?
dickens|The crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my life without your so generous help, is, they tell me, treason against the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an emigrant.
austen|But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.
dickens|I willingly obey the orders of my Chief, said The Vengeance with alacrity, and kissing her cheek.
dickens|For my childs sake!
dickens|He is quiet.
dickens|Now, go on, dear boy.
austen|By this time she is actually with them!
dickens|But at least there was dogs, Pip?
dickens|said Mr Cruncher.
dickens|The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their legs,irons of a pattern that I knew well.
dickens|At last she stopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it some seconds,  This is my birthday, Pip.
dickens|This thrown open, admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms his bedchamber and two others.
dickens|Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly wretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like Joes trade.
austen|Except the Sucklings and Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs Eltons acquaintance.
austen|Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply.
austen|Wellsitting down againgo onwhat else?
austen|These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the strawberrybeds.
dickens|She was on this side of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind the halfopened door of the dressingroom, in the dressingroom, in the room overhead, in the room beneath,everywhere.
austen|It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.
dickens|Beggar him, said Miss Havisham to Estella.
dickens|How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?
dickens|The honoured parent steering Northward, had not gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and the two trudged on together.
dickens|Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to widen again.
dickens|The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs JoeI never thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the housekeeping property as hisunited to the necessity of always keeping one hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about the kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind.
dickens|Are we not going too slowly?
austen|there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr Knightley.
austen|I would not have missed this meeting for the world.
austen|Well, said the still waiting Harriet;wellandand what shall I do?
austen|I am very glad you liked her.
dickens|But that, in shutting out the light of day, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she had secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that, her mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and must and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew equally well.
dickens|I mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village, and he lauded it to the skies.
austen|Mrs Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.
dickens|And wotsumeer the failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his hart.
austen|That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure.
dickens|I was often out in cold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been out a few times.
austen|I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.
dickens|There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the luckier or lighterhearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen together.
dickens|There was a fiction that Mr Wopsle examined  the scholars once a quarter.
austen|why do you smile so?
austen|Well, I cannot understand it.
dickens|Too true.
dickens|And I saw her yesterday.
austen|Why does not he try Bath?
dickens|Undoubtedly.
dickens|Extermination.
dickens|Sarah Pocket, returned Cousin Raymond, if a man is not his own neighbor, who is?
austen|The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;and they were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come.
austen|Mr Weston, do not mistake me.
dickens|I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself, during the journey, under that worthy gentlemans protection.
austen|I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs Cole told us of it at dinner.
dickens|On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent pause in that attitude, Indeed?
austen|He is certainly a good brother, said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.
austen|It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure was odious.
austen|You have only proved by this, cried Elizabeth, that Mr Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.
austen|Why does she not come in?
austen|John does not even mention your friend, said Mr Knightley.
austen|In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.
dickens|My gentleman must have horses, Pip!
austen|I thought you meant to go with me.
dickens|Ah!
dickens|I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life.
dickens|Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday, the blood that was to mingle with theirs tomorrow was already set apart.
dickens|He complied, and I went on alone.
dickens|Goodbye, Pip!
dickens|I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar immediately after breakfast.
austen|Arguments are too much like disputes.
dickens|If my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities, I dare say.
austen|Mr Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began  What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr Darcy!
dickens|I shook my head gloomily.
austen|Ah!
austen|This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when.
dickens|It is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there are no other means of getting at it.
dickens|The upshot of which, was, to smash this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to useless lumber.
austen|This letter tells usit is a short letterwritten in a hurry, merely to give us noticeit tells us that they are all coming up to town directly, on Mrs Churchills accountshe has not been well the whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for herso they are all to move southward without loss of time.
dickens|When Mr Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on the beach.
dickens|I thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse proceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Ageds sausage and he buttered the crumb of the Ageds roll.
dickens|He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.
austen|Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr Martin and Harriet now are?
austen|Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.
dickens|What is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?
austen|You take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns, said Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.
dickens|Biddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper, Dont let him come; I dont like him.
austen|I dare say the lace upon Mrs Hursts gown  Here she was interrupted again.
austen|Her father lifted up his eyes.
dickens|When she held her hands out she took her eyes from Mr Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us in succession.
austen|I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
austen|You must not disappoint your father.
dickens|The sound was curiously flawed by the wind; and I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it, when I heard a footstep on the stair.
austen|It was unpardonable.
dickens|Dear boy and Pips comrade, dont you be afeerd of me being low.
austen|It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling.
dickens|This was the time for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black bottle with a porcelaintopped cork, representing some clerical dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect.
austen|Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him?
dickens|Of course, I had taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order.
austen|A house in town!
austen|I admired your resolution very much, sir, said he, in venturing out in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.
dickens|It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries, because it would be dangerous.
dickens|You shall see me at the head of women, byandbye.
dickens|O that he had never come!
dickens|Four times five will do handsomely, will it?
austen|Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.
austen|Harriet had no penetration.
dickens|The last Hamlet as I dressed, made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to put a large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal which was the last I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and whenever his reading brought him into profile, I called out I dont see no wafers!
austen|Aye, I wonder which she will.
dickens|You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?
austen|But the imprudence of such a match!
dickens|Now, Handel, I am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes, upon my soul and honor!
dickens|Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some setoff against their swollen account of cruel rage.
dickens|With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner chamber at the back.
dickens|His business is the Law?
austen|said her aunt; a place, too, with which so many of your acquaintances are connected.
austen|Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.
dickens|No sooner did he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providence had put a prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me, and insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlor.
austen|What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,espionage, and treachery?
dickens|It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener might walk among his plants.
dickens|This is our sittingroom,just such chairs and tables and carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home.
dickens|Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be.
dickens|Fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children; and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and hoped.
dickens|Yes; for a walk with me.
dickens|It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him, for no voice could be heard in it.
austen|And what is your success?
dickens|Recalled to life.
austen|Till they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I am gone?
austen|Every body seemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this.
austen|Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration.
dickens|he said, with a start.
dickens|How old were you when you came upon him in the little churchyard?
austen|His appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now.
dickens|She presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St.
dickens|What do you mean, Belinda?
austen|You were kept waiting at the doorI was quite ashamedbut somehow there was a little bustlefor it so happened that we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did not know any body was coming.
dickens|Close up here.
austen|Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs Bennet one communication would, therefore, do for all.
dickens|Sure youre not a going to favor only one of us.
dickens|I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was all my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would have been easier with me.
dickens|Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr Lorry?
austen|But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going inobserving, as she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.
austen|This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.
austen|In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.
dickens|Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creaturesthe creatures of this chronicle among the restalong the roads that lay before them.
dickens|for I was going to thank him, I tell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldnt render them.
austen|He does not think of the draught.
dickens|Oh dear, not at all!
austen|In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.
dickens|It is not a great deal, that!
austen|They are not at all the less written you know, because you divide them.
dickens|For the love of the great God!
austen|He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friendher fair, lovely, amiable friend.
austen|A ladys imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment.
dickens|Is that the sort of fellow?
dickens|I am so ignorant.
austen|said he with a tender sigh, as he received it.
austen|A material difference then, she repliedand no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the lapse of oneandtwenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer?
dickens|These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum, and some tobaccostoppers carved by the Aged.
austen|Pass us, if you please, Mr Churchill.
dickens|So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been tainted by the slain.
dickens|Always the same with you people.
dickens|She seemed to raise it the listeners eyes were always on his paper, and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as if the axe had dropped.
dickens|And eight?
dickens|Forward!
dickens|I am almost sure it was you.
austen|She shall hear my opinion.
dickens|I crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.
dickens|He smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder.
austen|No; she heard nothing but the instant reply of, Beg her to walk up;and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.
dickens|There is a curse on it, and on all this land.
dickens|Monsieur Manette; Mr Lorry laid his hand upon Defarges arm; do you remember nothing of this man?
dickens|Whats the matter?
austen|He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr and Mrs Collinss happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too.
dickens|What is it you call him?
dickens|Who comes?
austen|You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs Weston for my feelings,  said Emma; were you to guess her to be eighteen, I should listen with pleasure; but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words.
dickens|The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me, and so I became aware of my sister,lying without sense or movement on the bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on the back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face was turned towards the fire,destined never to be on the Rampage again, while she was the wife of Joe.
austen|And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?
austen|Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another putoff.
dickens|And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.
austen|One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.
austen|That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination.
austen|Mr Bennet made no answer.
dickens|Dont you know?
austen|Mrs Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches, &c.
dickens|said Wemmick; how are you, Colonel?
dickens|And why not, citizen?
austen|The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense of its expediency.
dickens|Business is very bad; the people are so poor.
austen|Of what are you talking?
dickens|When they took a young man into Tellsons London house, they hid him somewhere till he was old.
dickens|At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letterwriting, handwashing, candlesnuffing, and safelocking, that closed the business of the day.
austen|Mr Martin!
dickens|Meanwhile, said the Marquis, I will preserve the honour and repose of the family, if you will not.
austen|The shame, he answered, is all mine, or ought to be.
austen|Mr Bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!
austen|To be constantly living with an illtempered person, must be dreadful.
dickens|Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.
dickens|Jerry!
dickens|If you expect me to be surprised, said her brother Solomon, I am not surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here.
dickens|It now shone brightly, through the door of communication.
dickens|Of all the days of my life, I never saw him.
dickens|I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs Pockets falling into a discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the baby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nutcrackers.
dickens|If it warnt for me youd have been to the churchyard long ago, and stayed there.
austen|three or fourandtwentycannot be without the means of doing as much as that.
austen|Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.
dickens|No.
dickens|I see Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name.
dickens|The Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his valet.
austen|They were the first entitled, after Mrs Weston and Emma, to be made happy;from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have been too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs Elton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her.
dickens|I wish Matthew could have that comfort, but he sets it at defiance.
austen|So began Miss Bates; and Mr Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,  How is your niece, Miss Bates?
dickens|Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked around him!
dickens|You quite understand that the young lady dont ride today, and that I dine at the young ladys?
austen|Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; but she behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent.
dickens|said he.
dickens|The cast was made in Newgate, directly after he was taken down.
dickens|The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now the newsExchange, and was filled to overflowing.
dickens|Speak, Jacques Five!
austen|An excellent consolation in its way, said Elizabeth, but it will not do for us.
dickens|She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his misery, and to a Present beyond his misery and the sound of her voice, the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always.
dickens|Yes.
dickens|Yes; I believe so.
austen|Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.
austen|Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?
austen|After lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.
dickens|His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded for Lucie and her child, without a moments demur; but the great trust he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business.
austen|I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation, replied Elizabeth, but it is not in my power to accept it.
dickens|Next he cries, Shell put it on me, and then Im done for!
austen|These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.
dickens|He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.
dickens|Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any.
dickens|He carried the child over, and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.
dickens|Not yet.
austen|The first, was his walking with her apart from the others, in the limewalk at Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he had taken pains as she was convinced to draw her from the rest to himselfand at first, he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!
austen|Jane, do you know I always fancy Mr Dixon like Mr John Knightley.
dickens|And he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending.
austen|and Mrs Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as yourself.
dickens|cried madame, contemptuously.
dickens|His cunning was fresh with the day, and his qualms were gone with the nightin which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleetstreet and the City of London, that fine morning.
dickens|And suchlike.
austen|What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?
dickens|Now, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we picked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all the evening, he had been in divers companies in several publichouses, and he had come back with myself and Mr Wopsle.
austen|I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.
dickens|I got away from him, without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire in the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to go to bed.
dickens|I had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me to find that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more probable.
dickens|Enough; you are English; that is another thing.
dickens|I sank back on my pillow after drinking, and the face that looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Joe.
dickens|said he, giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that made me turn hot and sick.
dickens|They are worth no more than that.
austen|You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did.
austen|You know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us.
austen|His tall, firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every bodys eyes; and, excepting her own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.
austen|She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.
dickens|And off his head comes!
dickens|It was obviously the weakness of the position.
austen|Oh!
dickens|Not dead!
dickens|I will.
dickens|It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.
dickens|The horses stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent, and open the coachdoor to let the passengers in.
dickens|The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening, at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.
austen|And I could take the pattern gown home any day.
dickens|He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow then, suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.
dickens|There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through.
austen|A most dangerous precedent indeed!
dickens|If it wos so, which I still dont say it is for I will not prewaricate to you, sir, let that there boy keep his fathers place, and take care of his mother; dont blow upon that boys fatherdo not do it, sirand let that father go into the line of the reglar diggin, and make amends for what he would have undugif it wos soby diggin of em in with a will, and with conwictions respectin the futur keepin of em safe.
austen|He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to make her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again.
dickens|I write it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty.
dickens|Is there?
austen|Insolent girl!
dickens|I wonder, said Mr Lorry, pausing in his looking about, that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him!
austen|, you are a thorough humourist.
austen|With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every bodys feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every bodys destiny.
austen|Mr Bennets expectations were fully answered.
austen|Selinas choicehandsome, I think, but I do not know whether it is not overtrimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being overtrimmedquite a horror of finery.
austen|Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away, it would be very distressing.
austen|Mr Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.
dickens|Judged!
austen|and good Mr Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.
austen|The great Mrs Churchill was no more.
dickens|You bring em both to me.
dickens|Dont look like the sort of one to get any, do he?
austen|This fine account of him, whispered her aunt as they walked, is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.
dickens|If I dozed for a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havishams cries, and by her running at me with all that height of fire above her head.
austen|No, indeedwe are not at all in a bad air.
austen|On these subjects, her perplexity and distress were very greatand her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.
dickens|She had admirers without end.
dickens|The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and windows open, they were overpowered by heat.
dickens|A bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.
austen|But hush, hush!
austen|Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?
austen|As for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr Westons aside as much as she can.
austen|I thoughtbut I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been under a mistake.
austen|She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr Elton; and Harriets mind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately gaining strength.
dickens|An hour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any wretch who creeps along the streets.
austen|You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married.
austen|His father had no apprehension of it.
austen|The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood.
austen|It was not Harriets hand that he was certain ofit was the dimensions of some famous ox.
dickens|And a very handsome sum of money too, I think.
dickens|Why dont you answer  Pip, returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, which I meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself and me, and which you know the answer to be full well No.
austen|William Larkins is such an old acquaintance!
austen|I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existencenever paid her any attentions, but as your friend never cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend.
austen|This is coming as you should do, said she; like a gentleman.
dickens|Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window.
austen|Proof indeed!
dickens|A pretty pattern too!
austen|Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character.
dickens|said the pale young gentleman, reaching out his hand goodhumoredly, its all over now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if youll forgive me for having knocked you about so.
dickens|You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?
austen|She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.
dickens|Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been in constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer into the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought he would be safest where he was, and he said.
dickens|No, returned the stranger, but once and away, and on a Saturday night too.
dickens|Towards Mr Pocket, as a grownup infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed the complacent forbearance I had heard them express.
austen|Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.
dickens|Howsever, the boy went there to play.
dickens|I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the innocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business life.
dickens|And Herbert had seen him as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red brick, and an outrageous hat all over bells.
austen|You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created.
austen|Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.
dickens|Ah!
dickens|His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water, carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.
dickens|Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised together,if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.
austen|Emma, that I fear is a wordNo, I have no wishStay, yes, why should I hesitate?
austen|After an interval of some minutes, however, he began with,  I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn, instead of coming here.
dickens|My father, exclaimed Lucie, you are ill!
dickens|Madame Defarge being sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large earrings.
austen|Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible.
austen|Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr Darcys indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.
austen|Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.
austen|Oh!
austen|Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr Wingfields, which we have been applying at times ever since August.
dickens|When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings, and they, having finally alighted near the Saints boundaries, were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband  Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?
dickens|Youve hit it, sir!
dickens|Until she opened the side entrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must necessarily be nighttime.
austen|It was almost enough to make her think of marrying.
austen|said he.
austen|and so it does, I vow.
dickens|Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again!
dickens|When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman Compeyson looked, wi his curly hair and his black clothes and his white pockethandkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked.
austen|Mr Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs Bennet by admiring Mrs Phillipss manners and politeness.
austen|Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been making up her mind the whole day?
austen|It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriets behalf, though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter was at hand.
austen|But, Mr Knightley, how could you possibly have heard it?
austen|Not the least in the world.
austen|Trouble!
dickens|P.
austen|Well, I was persuaded there were two.
dickens|Its the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice, said Jerry.
austen|He thought it very well done of Mr Knightley to invite themvery kind and sensiblemuch cleverer than dining out.
dickens|I wish I was a frog.
dickens|He paid for them, did he not?
austen|They were laying themselves open to that very phraseand to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another.
austen|Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.
austen|You will never go to Swisserland.
dickens|I dont know, said I.
dickens|Who could that be with Mr Lorrythe owner of the ridingcoat upon the chairwho must not be seen?
dickens|It was the money left me, and the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr Jaggersall for youwhen he first come arter you, agreeable to my letter.
austen|I wish, said Mrs Weston, one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best.
dickens|He was very communicative last night, and told me more of his life.
dickens|As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,for he and I had walked together,he stood on the hearthrug, after ringing the bell, and took a searching look at them.
austen|turning to Emma.
dickens|Pray what is your business?
dickens|Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures, replied Estella, with a glance towards him, hover about a lighted candle.
dickens|said she, as she sewed.
dickens|said one.
dickens|How?
dickens|I have no more to say, said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for a little while.
dickens|Who is it?
dickens|He told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming.
austen|These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself.
austen|But yet I think there was something wanting.
austen|If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.
dickens|Yes.
austen|I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing.
austen|I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things.
austen|Mr Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?
austen|Her mind returned to Mrs Eltons offences, and long, very long, did they occupy her.
austen|Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.
dickens|Yes!
austen|Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.
dickens|Thats real enough.
dickens|Hes in wonderful feather.
austen|He understood what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else.
dickens|It was a little past midday when the fourhorse stagecoach by which I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about the Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.
dickens|O dear good faithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm, as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angels wing!
austen|She was obliged to stop and think.
dickens|I am going to tell you.
dickens|But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency to Biddy, and we dropped the subject.
austen|Everything wore a happier aspect.
dickens|I saw him then, messieurs, began the mender of roads, a year ago this running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the chain.
austen|He perfectly knew his own meaning; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,he resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a favourable answer.
austen|Affectation of candour is common enoughone meets with it everywhere.
dickens|The house was damp and decayed, indifferently furnishedevidently, recently occupied and temporarily used.
austen|Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!
dickens|I know them to have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself.
austen|Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits, which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.
austen|I have made a most wretched discovery, said he, after a short pause.
austen|Well!
austen|She must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young womans scheme than an elderly mans.
dickens|She was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with her, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again.
austen|Mr Elton, and Miss Hawkins!
dickens|The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his forehead on his hands.
dickens|May I ask what they are?
austen|When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small.
dickens|The sergeant made some kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the convict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard, to go on board first.
dickens|Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and that it has been here some time?
austen|I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.
dickens|Are you in much pain today?
austen|His manner had no air of study or exaggeration.
dickens|well!
dickens|He had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his safekey on the palm of his hand.
dickens|It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneurs lips.
dickens|Let me think it out!
dickens|And scornfully walked away, andwhat was worsetook the candle with her.
austen|I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.
dickens|But again there came upon me, for my relief, that odd impression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.
dickens|Same place.
austen|I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a woman.
dickens|I could not bring myself to bear the sight of him, and I thought he had a worse look by daylight.
austen|A likeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouses performances must be capital.
dickens|Molly, let them see your wrist.
austen|Mr Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately arranged.
dickens|Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct into a little garden overlooking the river, where Mr Pockets children were playing about.
dickens|We were not in a grand way of business, but we had a good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well.
dickens|Camilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she murmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, Poor dear soul!
austen|For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs Weston had received.
dickens|Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage which might have been lighter, conducted by four posthorses and two postilions, fagged up a steep hill.
dickens|Yes, said I.
austen|How can they suit each other?
dickens|It was remarkable but perhaps the wretched life he had led accounted for it that he was the least anxious of any of us.
austen|Emma could not forgive her;but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr Knightley, who had been of the party, and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with Mr Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma.
austen|A most delightful place!
austen|Mr Darcy!
dickens|Mrs Camels, by which I presently understood he meant Camilla, she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in spirits when she wake up in the night.
austen|and it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.
dickens|What is that?
dickens|She is going to be married.
austen|He has passed you very often.
dickens|In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a  I saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, A clerk.
dickens|It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I dont know why I did it, in the second.
austen|An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.
austen|Mrs Weston, you would be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing.
austen|She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingleys two sisters.
austen|Elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.
austen|I wanted them to put off the wedding.
dickens|Thank you.
dickens|No.
austen|How do you do?
dickens|Keep where you are, the guard called to the voice in the mist, because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in your lifetime.
dickens|Didnt us, Pip?
austen|We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.
dickens|As I knew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the way was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better than none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into Pumblechooks just as the street and the shops were lighting up.
dickens|People are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob, and forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking questions.
dickens|Now, he pursued, you remember what youve undertook, and you remember that young man, and you get home!
dickens|It was then I began to understand that everything in the room had stopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago.
dickens|Few children were to be seen, and no dogs.
austen|He comes to Highbury himself, he says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Fords.
austen|She heard enough to know that Mr Weston was giving some information about his son; she heard the words my son, and Frank, and my son, repeated several times over; and, from a few other halfsyllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but before she could quiet Mr Elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward.
austen|The vicious propensitiesthe want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr Darcy could not have.
dickens|It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways, and we got on famously.
austen|dear me!
dickens|Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!
dickens|I could see nothing of the room except the shining of the fire in the windowglass, but I stiffened in all my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.
dickens|Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside it at the corner with his hand in mine, were the twoandthirty men and women; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and weeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about.
dickens|Really I must say I should think not!
austen|Does she live near you, sir?
austen|She could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa, removing to a seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.
austen|He continued,  Depend upon it, Elton will not do.
dickens|Well!
austen|You will be glad to hear inclining his head, and whispering seriously that my uncle means to give her all my aunts jewels.
austen|The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;her proposal of taking another turn, her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to, might be a little extraordinary!
dickens|You left Paris yesterday, sir?
dickens|He has not received the notice yet, but I know that he will presently be summoned for tomorrow, and removed to the Conciergerie; I have timely information.
austen|The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.
austen|Miss Bates said a great deal; Mrs Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouses presiding; Mr Knightleys answer was the most distinct.
austen|Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.
dickens|The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head; as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still containing himself, that great means of regeneration.
austen|She is almost threeandtwenty!
dickens|O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?
dickens|I am serious, said Estella, not so much with a frown for her brow was smooth as with a darkening of her face; if we are to be thrown much together, you had better believe it at once.
austen|He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion.
austen|No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells.
dickens|Speak to your master?
austen|He took the hint, and soon began with, This seems a very comfortable house.
dickens|he exclaimed.
austen|Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.
dickens|The silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes.
dickens|I answer for my fellowJurymen.
dickens|You can bear it?
austen|When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence.
austen|When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better, for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object.
austen|Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.
austen|Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs Weston, very soon after their moving into the drawingroom wishing her joyyet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.
austen|But it must not, shall not be.
dickens|It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows within, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound.
austen|How can it affect them?
austen|I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.
dickens|Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary farms, dyeworks, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes, avenues of leafless trees.
austen|I see it in your countenance.
dickens|My picture was in her room, and I was in her prayers.
dickens|With my husband standing by!
dickens|I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and the rain always rushing by.
austen|As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters.
dickens|He drank again, and became more ferocious.
dickens|What is the matter?
austen|no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting.
dickens|Equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to anxious whisperers,always singly,Wemmick with his postoffice in an immovable state, looked at them while in conference, as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made, since last observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.
dickens|and Biddy put her apron to her face.
dickens|As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the soul to be stronger than the sun.
dickens|He could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both separately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from falling.
dickens|It is possible.
dickens|Well, Mr Wemmick, said the turnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates, and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, whats Mr Jaggers going to do with that waterside murder?
dickens|Why, whats the matter with you?
austen|Quite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfaxs opinion last night.
austen|People do not die of little trifling colds.
dickens|I come from Doctor Manette.
dickens|The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs Joe stood staring; at which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses.
dickens|Really?
austen|Yes, maam, all.
austen|I dare say, replied Mrs Weston, smiling, that I thought so then;but since we have parted, I can never remember Emmas omitting to do any thing I wished.
dickens|Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them, said Defarge to the turnkey.
dickens|Oh!
dickens|Not I!
dickens|Yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling him that as I should be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I had decided to hurry down and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss Havisham was faring.
dickens|It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.
austen|I really am ashamed of always leading the way.
dickens|But I had a reason that was an old reason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word convict.
austen|She had been thinking of him the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.
austen|Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose, said Mr Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
dickens|How are you going to live, Biddy?
austen|She was received with a cordial respect which could not but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for.
dickens|Do you know me?
dickens|He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the Third.
dickens|Now, you think I may not be right?
dickens|I have only been to the churchyard, said I, from my stool, crying and rubbing myself.
dickens|Now comes the difference.
dickens|He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head.
austen|and exactly Emmas age.
austen|With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return.
austen|If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had.
austen|And in a louder, steadier tone, he concluded with, He will soon be gone.
austen|no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and amused to think how little information I obtained.
dickens|You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!
austen|This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severe campfever, as he believed had saved his life.
austen|Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?
dickens|On these occasions, Wemmick took his books and papers into Mr Jaggerss room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer office.
austen|Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses.
austen|They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South.
dickens|Why, if I see one pursuing party last nightcoming up in order, Damn em, with their tramp, trampI see a hundred.
austen|To Hartfield, if you please, Mrs Ford.
dickens|Husbands, and brothers, and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon, Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from him!
austen|What has he been judging by?
austen|Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.
austen|Name your day, and I will come.
austen|Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?
dickens|Speak well of the law.
austen|Mr Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case.
austen|Depend upon it, Mrs Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did.
austen|and when he comes again, if his affection continue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.
austen|At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he had paid it.
dickens|Rather, Pip.
dickens|I caught at the name directly.
dickens|I had come out of Kingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal.
austen|Half a minute brought it all out.
dickens|You done it; now you pays for it.
dickens|Yes, Pip, observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beermug.
austen|After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began  In vain I have struggled.
austen|Satisfied that it was so, and feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had been.
dickens|Hah!
austen|Mr Knightley, is not she?
austen|It is the greatest amusement in the world!
dickens|All Ive got aint mine; its yourn.
austen|I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.
austen|Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.
dickens|I did.
dickens|I have proved myself, and I know better.
dickens|A light, or a shade the old gentleman could not have said which, passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hillside on a wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little flaming logs, which was tumbling forward.
dickens|The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and emphatically, Very true!
dickens|I asked, after considering it.
dickens|I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting four richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of harnessing.
dickens|And I done it.
dickens|As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he stopped at a shopwindow where there was a mirror, and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coatcollar, and his wild hair.
dickens|Which I meantersay as sech if youre a man, come on!
dickens|My parting blessing on my love.
dickens|With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural place for me, that day.
austen|how much of good or evil must be done by him!
dickens|I dont wonder at it; its not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another.
dickens|Father dear!
dickens|He had had them, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years.
austen|The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr Knightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which womans friendship and womans feelings would not justify.
austen|Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament.
dickens|What has happened?
dickens|And its impossible to say what he couldnt get, if he gave his mind to it.
austen|Wherever you and Jane are known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple ofor I may say, threevery silly sisters.
dickens|Will you please to enter the carriage?
dickens|Now, said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, what do you want?
dickens|He wishes to have a messenger at hand.
austen|Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her forcibly.
austen|Her ladyship was highly incensed.
dickens|Carton left him there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate again when it was shut, and touched it.
dickens|I thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast, in that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him on the shoulder.
dickens|Who praised me when I learnt my lesson?
dickens|Within myself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with injustice.
dickens|Will nothing of it remain?
austen|It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing.
dickens|Mr Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and meat, wine, and hot coffee.
dickens|But, when I had secured my boxplace by tomorrows coach, and had been down to Mr Pockets and back, I was not by any means convinced on the last point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up at the Blue Boar.
dickens|See what a place you fill at seventyeight.
austen|Upon my word, sir, cried Elizabeth, your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration.
dickens|After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig, and dig, dignow with a spade, now with a great key, now with his handsto dig this wretched creature out.
austen|She was extremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good qualities.
dickens|Nonsense.
austen|Mr Weston was chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last the drawingroom party did receive an augmentation.
dickens|Caution?
dickens|I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before yesterday was, as usual, a cold one, observed the nephew.
austen|And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?
dickens|She knew full well that Miss Pross was the familys devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was the familys malevolent enemy.
dickens|The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr Lorrys desk.
dickens|There, being the window, I crossed to it, and stood there, in a very uncomfortable state of mind, looking out.
dickens|Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road.
austen|The first halfhour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door.
dickens|And she showed me her children, said the Doctor of Beauvais, and they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me.
austen|Not at all.
austen|A moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened.
dickens|In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow rising in him for the sixtythree who had been that day put to death, and for tomorrows victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons, and still of tomorrows and tomorrows, the chain of association that brought the words home, like a rusty old ships anchor from the deep, might have been easily found.
austen|How, where, when?
dickens|This reply seemed agreeable to Mr Jaggers, who said, I thought so!
dickens|On the day before it, I received an official note from Wemmick, informing me that Mr Jaggers would be glad if I would call upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day.
dickens|Only adopted.
dickens|He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here.
austen|Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy.
austen|You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as you were the person slighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work on my fathers compassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you.
dickens|It was the first time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to come near me.
dickens|What?
dickens|On his housetop, he displayed pike and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his Little Sainte Guillotinefor the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised.
dickens|To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the first time, saw Mr Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression on anybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest.
austen|said she.
austen|I may be allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr Perry.
dickens|Miss Havisham?
austen|Have you, upon your honour?
dickens|The raindrops are still falling, large, heavy, and few, said Doctor Manette.
dickens|Rome will be a ugly customer to you, if you dont.
austen|I believe her to be both in a great degree, replied Wickham; I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.
austen|Her congratulations were warm and open; but Emma could not speak so fluently.
austen|I am sure you must be, said he, and I will send you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever use.
austen|Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.
dickens|Well!
austen|Will you come and see me?
austen|So much the man of fashion!
austen|You cannot mean to say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin.
austen|that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain here.
austen|The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, My brother Mr Sucklings seat;a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove.
dickens|I added, that of course, when the time came, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might be safest in Wemmicks judgment.
austen|As much as I ever wish to be, cried Elizabeth very warmly.
austen|Cautious, very cautious, thought Emma; he advances inch by inch, and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.
austen|I am impatient to see him.
dickens|William, bring a watercress.
dickens|But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of Monseigneur were perfectly dressed.
austen|And I will own to you, I am sure it will be safe, that so far as our living with Mr Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled.
dickens|Therefore, I followed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish.
dickens|Nothing worth mentioning, replied Camilla.
dickens|It never did run out, however, but was brought to a premature end, as I proceed to relate.
dickens|Im so awful dull.
dickens|Congratulations, Mr Pip.
dickens|cried the sawyer.
dickens|We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so wrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from France, and that she was going to London.
austen|It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!
dickens|It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning, said Defarge.
dickens|I saw reawakening appetite in the Roman nostrils of Mr Wopsle.
dickens|But, there was one remarkable piece of evidence on the spot.
dickens|To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.
austen|She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfaxs feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of the room, arm in arm, with an appearance of goodwill highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each.
dickens|That was another thing.
austen|He liked very much to have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked.
dickens|Done with their buttons?
austen|Mrs Elton, as elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in silencewanting only to observe enough for Isabellas informationbut Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could talk to her.
austen|You take up an idea, Mrs Weston, and run away with it; as you have many a time reproached me with doing.
dickens|Had he ever been a spy himself?
dickens|He had heard of Monseigneur, at the postinghouses, as being before him.
austen|but surely, Mr Churchill, nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls.
austen|Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, Is Mr Elton gone on foot to Donwell?
austen|Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth.
austen|Three daughters married!
dickens|Yes, I suppose so.
austen|If we make haste, said Lydia, as they walked along, perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.
dickens|You do not find it easy to advise me?
dickens|He thinks, said the landlord, a weakly meditative man with a pale eye, who seemed to rely greatly on his Jack,he thinks they was, what they wasnt.
austen|Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a very true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that her husband could write a good letter.
austen|Good girl!
dickens|Is the moment come?
dickens|When he had talked with me a little, he said to Mrs Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which were black and handsome, Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr Pip?
dickens|said Mr Stryver.
dickens|Theres one thing you may be sure of, Pip, said Joe, after some rumination, namely, that lies is lies.
austen|We do not often look upon fine young men, wellbred and agreeable.
austen|She then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an opportunity, to thank youI could not thank you too muchfor every wish and every endeavour to do her good.
austen|Take whatever you like, and get away.
austen|You may depend upon my not mentioning it.
dickens|Round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was coming near home.
austen|My friend Robert could not resist.
austen|She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.
austen|But think no more of the letter.
dickens|After receiving the charge with every mark of derision, the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to hand.
dickens|I know I am quite myself.
dickens|Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in.
dickens|Likewise the person with him?
dickens|He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and simplicity, four years ago.
dickens|You have acted as if you do; but I dont think you do.
dickens|Nine, ten, eleven?
dickens|My gifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could have wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable.
austen|Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.
austen|He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish.
dickens|Because, said Mr Lorry, I wouldnt go on such an object without having some cause to believe that I should succeed.
austen|yes, I am quite aware of that.
dickens|Yes, yes!
dickens|They whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say that a petition has been presented to the King himself.
austen|The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass.
austen|While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was ready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in.
dickens|Whats the matter?
dickens|When I had lain awake a little while, those extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves audible.
austen|But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place.
dickens|Yes.
austen|Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.
dickens|Two or three times.
dickens|Dont tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; dont tell him, Biddy, that I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honored you both, because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child, I said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I did.
dickens|On the fourteenth.
austen|The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.
dickens|He was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.
austen|Henry is the eldest, he was named after me, not after his father.
austen|Mrs Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and Mr Churchill could be reconciled to the engagements becoming known; as, considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reportsbut Mr Weston had thought differently; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for such things,  he observed, always got about.
dickens|My convict never looked at me, except that once.
dickens|Good night, citizen.
austen|He did consent.
austen|Wellas you please; only dont have a great set out.
austen|By your account, he does seem to have had some scruples.
dickens|asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr Wemmicks humor.
dickens|I turned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open, and to force out of their swollen throats, O, what a man he is!
dickens|He emptied his glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with his heavy brown hand on the mantelshelf.
dickens|I turned my eyesa little dimmed by looking up at the frosty lighttowards a great wooden beam in a low nook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure hanging there by the neck.
dickens|When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart.
dickens|Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me.
dickens|I became imbued with the notion on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what means.
dickens|Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an affectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed.
dickens|His partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than he thought.
austen|Consider how important every moment is in such a case.
dickens|Well, well!
dickens|French, eh?
austen|Is she really not ill?
dickens|You say nothing of her, remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked on.
dickens|But dont you never find it a little eating?
austen|He did not talk to me of his own arts, said Fitzwilliam, smiling.
austen|That will be a much better thing.
austen|Emma was just describing the nature of her friends complaint;a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her, a quick, low pulse, &c.
dickens|That the mother was still living.
dickens|Can I do anything for you, Mr Stryver?
dickens|Lets put em on!
austen|They must take the consequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!
dickens|She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful.
austen|Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.
dickens|I am a doctor, my poor fellow, said I.
dickens|At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so well.
dickens|Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law.
austen|How very beautiful!
dickens|That is to say, you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from Wemmick one hundred and twentyfive pounds per quarter, until you are in communication with the fountainhead, and no longer with the mere agent.
dickens|Well?
austen|yescertainly.
dickens|I will never refer to it again.
austen|Oh!
dickens|I have seen with my eyes.
dickens|And so you are here, Pip?
austen|how shall you employ yourself when you grow old?
austen|The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.
dickens|But what would you have?
dickens|Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out, and it fell wet and thick.
dickens|He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell.
dickens|Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr Lorry, tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!
dickens|You understandany one.
austen|she says she cannot bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress.
austen|The Coles were very respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them.
austen|This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this morning.
dickens|Neither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it.
austen|You appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues tomorrow will bring, I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself tonight.
austen|I wish I were anywhere else.
dickens|Hence Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich FarmerGeneral, poor in family.
austen|That she is a gentlemans daughter, is indubitable to me; that she associates with gentlemens daughters, no one, I apprehend, will deny.
dickens|But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is Mr Charles Darnay.
dickens|He had been ominously heard of, through the playbills, as a faithful Black, in connection with a little girl of noble birth, and a monkey.
austen|At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.
austen|Miss Nash, headteacher at Mrs Goddards, had written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouses help, to get a great many more.
dickens|In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper.
dickens|Young Jerry, said Mr Cruncher, turning to his offspring, its a buryin.
dickens|Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that was never to leave off.
austen|She will be missed every moment.
austen|Between Mr Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax?
dickens|Let us make one more round of the garden, and then go in.
dickens|I pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once meant to desert him.
dickens|There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.
austen|Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure.
austen|Oh!
dickens|He had been some few leagues behind Monseigneur, early in the afternoon.
austen|He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her  My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?
austen|Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.
austen|What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any weddingcake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly tried to prevent any bodys eating it.
dickens|I should have loved her under any circumstances.
austen|She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own independence, relieve him from that state of indecision, which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.
dickens|When he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just intelligible  How goes it, Jacques?
dickens|Butreally, you know, Mr Stryver Mr Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally, you know there really is so much too much of you!
dickens|Why of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip, said my guardian, comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, because the man who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man.
austen|You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.
dickens|Yes, Joe.
austen|The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of the engagement?
dickens|Now you pays for it.
austen|I never can be thankful, Mr Bennet, for anything about the entail.
dickens|Why need you tell me what I have not asked?
austen|You think I ought to refuse him then, said Harriet, looking down.
austen|I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing!
dickens|She was seated at her dressingtable, and looked round at us immediately.
dickens|POCKET, JUN.
dickens|Lookee here, Pip.
austen|I see the imprudence of it.
austen|No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.
dickens|The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed.
austen|Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means.
austen|It opens his designs to his family, it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm prepossession.
dickens|Here it is.
dickens|A boy may lock his door, may be warm in bed, may tuck himself up, may draw the clothes over his head, may think himself comfortable and safe, but that young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him open.
austen|I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.
dickens|Pip, said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, there has been larks.
dickens|Why I fail in my ability to finish it, I cannot explain.
austen|Well, now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her.
dickens|A moment afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall, in the midst of whom was the woodsawyer hand in hand with The Vengeance.
austen|You must have heard every thing to be sure.
austen|Clements, because Wickhams lodgings were in that parish.
austen|no, indeed.
austen|It was easy to decide that she was still too young; and Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over.
austen|The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.
austen|But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sisters indifference.
dickens|Pull off gentlemans boots in Concord.
dickens|Yes, unhappily.
dickens|Quite my opinion, said Drummle, and what I should have suggested myself, or donemore likelywithout suggesting.
dickens|I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it.
dickens|My sister, Mrs Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap.
austen|You think so, do you?
austen|Yes, said his brother hesitatingly, there is a likeness.
dickens|Why, how ever could Tar come there?
austen|She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.
dickens|There was no other music than their own singing.
dickens|You know that what is said between you and me goes no further.
austen|As an old friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.
austen|yes, I always like news.
dickens|Afterwards she kept her hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they were heavy.
austen|There is my newsI thought it would interest you, said Mr Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them.
dickens|I dont feel it.
austen|If I had not promoted Mr Westons visits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all.
austen|And now, let me talk to you of something else.
austen|He immediately offered to fetch her othersall that his library afforded.
austen|I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
dickens|Oh dear me!
austen|Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question.
dickens|Its all right, dear boy!
dickens|I hoped it was true?
dickens|Yet, said Mr Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed, Porkregarded as biledis rich, too; aint it?
austen|Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would be ingratitude.
austen|if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!
dickens|I passed you on the road?
dickens|Some three years, or three years and a half ago.
dickens|Mr Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellsons bank?
dickens|You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferers mind, and how difficulthow almost impossibleit is, for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.
dickens|On the edge of the river I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the prospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the beacon by which the sailors steered,like an unhooped cask upon a pole,an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate.
dickens|Its disapinting to a man, he said, in a coarse broken voice, arter having looked forard so distant, and come so fur; but youre not to blame for that,neither on us is to blame for that.
austen|And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.
dickens|What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already at work on the hilltop beyond the village, with his days dinner not much to carry lying in a bundle that it was worth no crows while to peck at, on a heap of stones?
austen|With such sensations, Mr Eltons civilities were dreadfully illtimed; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very crossand of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the substance of it, from the openhearted Mr Weston.
austen|She would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr Knightley.
dickens|Flags!
austen|Good God!
dickens|He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it, to appreciate it comfortably I thought, or to have anybody to dine with him, without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor.
dickens|It will depend on you, and it could depend on no better man.
austen|I must still add to this long letter.
dickens|Heres Mr Pip, aged parent, said Wemmick, and I wish you could hear his name.
dickens|You did, said Wemmick.
dickens|But there was a quantity of chalk about our country, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it to account.
dickens|And by his friends, were her explanation, I mean into the hands of his sister Mrs J.
austen|The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.
austen|Is this fair, Mrs Weston?
dickens|When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she laid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never since looked upon the light of day.
austen|A great deal of good management, depend upon it.
dickens|At breakfasttime my sister declared her intention of going to town with us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechooks and called for when we had done with our fine ladiesa way of putting the case, from which Joe appeared inclined to augur the worst.
austen|The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised, but Jane Fairfaxs is much beyond it.
dickens|The corner echoed and reechoed with the tread of feet; some, as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in the distant streets, and not one within sight.
austen|The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.
austen|But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair.
austen|Do not imagine, madam, she continued, that I was taught wrong.
dickens|As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside passengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling their ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised when Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were two convicts going down with me.
dickens|And what was Compeysons business in which we was to go pardners?
dickens|You should say, repeated Drummle.
austen|And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs Eltons notice and the penury of her conversation, rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real, generous affection.
dickens|What I dreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and commonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one of the wooden windows of the forge.
dickens|I was then delivered over to Mr Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were the Sheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been dying to make all along Boy, be forever grateful to all friends, but especially unto them which brought you up by hand!
dickens|As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next discussed with him what dress he should wear.
dickens|Darn me if I couldnt eat em, said the man, with a threatening shake of his head, and if I hant half a mind tot!
dickens|When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured anon struggled out of the smoke again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake and contending with the fire.
dickens|Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there, pointing to him who had tossed the paper over, and then look well upon the prisoner.
dickens|Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to develop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of, was this As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less easy with me.
dickens|I could ha got clear of these deathcold flats likewiselook at my leg you wont find much iron on itif I hadnt made the discovery that he was here.
austen|Such things do occur, undoubtedly.
austen|The son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.
dickens|Sugar and milk.
dickens|At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the third time.
dickens|We are thoughtful tonight!
austen|The strangest things do take place!
dickens|Woman imbecile and piglike!
austen|I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin.
austen|Good God!
austen|Dont let us be severe, dont let us be in a hurry to condemn him.
austen|The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me.
austen|He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.
austen|I am sure you were of use to me, cried Emma.
dickens|I will faithfully, replied the man, if you will come with me.
dickens|It was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persisted in addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.
austen|Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, I have never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.
austen|These were the contents  MY DEAR HARRIET,  You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning, as soon as I am missed.
dickens|Herbert, said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, can you see me best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?
dickens|Hears his number called, hears himself challenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders Make ready!
dickens|as if it were a wellknown fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation, provided I could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor.
austen|I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy.
austen|Tea was carrying round, and Mr Weston, having said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.
dickens|It plaited itself into whatever I thought of, as a bodily pain would have done.
dickens|We can kill as well as the men when the place is taken!
austen|No, no, said Emma, it will not reckon low.
austen|So imprudent a match on both sides!
austen|She is not to pay for the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up.
dickens|Were you known in London, once?
austen|They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in favour of a pleasant party.
austen|If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have contrived it between September and January.
dickens|It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips, he murmured some words.
austen|Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of.
dickens|Two French gentlemen.
dickens|You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy.
austen|Well, well, I only hope it will last.
austen|there is a great difference.
austen|Emma had not to listen to such paradings againto any so exclusively addressed to herselfso disgustingly decorated with a dear Miss Woodhouse.
dickens|And you?
austen|Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment.
dickens|Even when I was taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs.
austen|Oh!
dickens|I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I had finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men in authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the Crown itself.
austen|You will laugh at my warmthbut, upon my word, I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.
dickens|When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge, picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
dickens|Say then, my husband.
dickens|I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet.
dickens|The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur the Marquis.
dickens|It aint a grab at a mans whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man to which your sister was quite welcome, that ud put a man off from getting a little child out of punishment.
dickens|asked my sister, laughing.
dickens|Is this young gentleman one of the prentices or articled ones of your office?
dickens|Thats my life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off, arter Pip stood my friend.
austen|I think their father is too rough with them very often.
dickens|What do you mean?
dickens|My poor sister Charlotte, who was next me and died before she was fourteen, was a striking example.
austen|But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.
dickens|Ah!
austen|Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe him capable.
austen|She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.
austen|The ball proceeded pleasantly.
austen|And Mrs Weston!
dickens|exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had assisted.
dickens|If only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should have felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her the three ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didnt know what to do.
dickens|Tell us your name!
dickens|There was duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly.
dickens|She had in part suspected, and in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husbands share in it, and my being resorted to.
austen|Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she were totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been, such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly resolved.
austen|Excuse me, maam, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends.
dickens|Involuntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me when I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.
dickens|What?
dickens|The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind.
dickens|Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED TO LIFE.
austen|Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and every thing usual followed.
dickens|Was that kind?
austen|Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his fathers dinner waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs Weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr Woodhouse, to betray any imperfection which could be concealed.
dickens|I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, In the City.
dickens|I assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favored with further particulars.
austen|It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble.
dickens|And the knittingwomen, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two.
dickens|The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the distance.
austen|It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast.
dickens|And yet, when I think of Estella  And when dont you, you know?
dickens|No!
austen|To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.
dickens|I cant afford it.
austen|Come Emma, set your companions the example.
austen|It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining any influence to alarm.
austen|Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!
dickens|Ah!
austen|But it is not merely this affair, she continued, on which my dislike is founded.
dickens|said Herbert.
austen|Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherines curiosity.
dickens|I heard there by chance, yesterday morning, said Wemmick, that a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not unpossessed of portable property,I dont know who it may really be,we wont name this person  Not necessary, said I.
dickens|But there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what I had that night found out, and to remind him that we waited for his hint.
austen|It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.
dickens|Are they any wiser?
dickens|demanded Joe.
austen|Oh!
austen|To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations.
dickens|We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel.
dickens|All the fifteen were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.
dickens|Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?
dickens|There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a footstep was there.
austen|How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?
dickens|The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.
austen|Mr Collins must excuse me.
austen|He was coming through the hall.
dickens|Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who sits there.
dickens|Monsieur Defarge whispered it closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.
austen|Jane should therefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command his attention.
dickens|How do you do?
austen|Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come?
dickens|Though mind you, Pip, said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the poker on the top bar, rendering unto all their doo, and maintaining equal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his hart, dont you see?
dickens|And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe.
austen|that was the worst of all.
dickens|I want to know what is to be done.
dickens|Also, they stood about the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks that filled the whole neighborhood with admiration; and they had a mysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as taking the culprit.
austen|According to Miss Batesit all came from herMrs Dixon had written most pressingly.
austen|Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves.
dickens|A child too!
austen|She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feel afraid.
dickens|Let him ware them, when hes lost his nevvy!
austen|He is a most fortunate man!
austen|I like them extremely.
austen|This is very true, said she, at least as far as relates to me, which was all that was meantand it is very shameful.
dickens|Every eye was turned to the jury.
dickens|Yes, I was.
austen|The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.
austen|Much of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for.
austen|Oh!
dickens|For answer he repeated, without any change of emphasis, the words  Do you know me?
austen|In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not always listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs Weston would be disappointed.
dickens|I never have been so surprised in my life, as I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his back, looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly foreshortened.
dickens|A new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative; or rather, his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already there.
austen|Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr Collinss correspondence for any consideration.
austen|My father was not only fond of this young mans society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.
dickens|Nothing yet.
dickens|Carelessly worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap.
dickens|And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church today, and are in charity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you have done for me, and all I have so ill repaid!
dickens|I have heard about it, Pip.
dickens|Above all things, I resolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making some last poor resistance to him.
austen|All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum.
austen|The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.
austen|Mrs Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.
austen|And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.
dickens|There is no help for it.
dickens|One night he brought her here asleep, and I called her Estella.
dickens|Is that a weapon in your hand?
austen|You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.
austen|Mr Darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings.
dickens|When we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?
dickens|Thankee, Sir, returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal, since you are so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run contrairy to your own opinions.
dickens|Was he not an emigrant then?
austen|My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it.
dickens|Something to drink?
austen|Let me do it without further loss of time.
dickens|Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down, and to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards Clara.
austen|Such as Mrs Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such she appeared whenever they met again,selfimportant, presuming, familiar, ignorant, and illbred.
dickens|Dn the fellow!
dickens|This was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal with as for me.
dickens|To be registered?
austen|Good soul!
austen|Her fathers feelings were quite distinct.
dickens|Why dont you ask him?
austen|That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my present perfect indifference, she continued, I will farther tell you, that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I did like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to himnay, was attachedand how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.
dickens|Another person, who had not joined the group, or interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away.
dickens|It was the nephew of Monseigneur.
dickens|He told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in each others arms, and that there had been a struggle under water, and that he had disengaged himself, struck out, and swum away.
austen|She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove.
dickens|Let me see you play cards with this boy.
dickens|I wouldnt lend anybody a sixpence.
dickens|All around outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which, occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray.
austen|She has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself.
austen|But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.
dickens|You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady, said Mr Stryver; Ill do that for you.
dickens|A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and looking seaward particularly at those times when the tide made, and was near flood.
dickens|Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger.
austen|I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion.
dickens|cried the blatant Stryver.
dickens|Dont mind me.
dickens|Youll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about it, before its done with, you know.
austen|When you told Mrs Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?
dickens|Anyhow, my dear Handel, said he presently, soldiering wont do.
dickens|No half measures with me.
austen|We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa?
austen|And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else.
dickens|Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude.
dickens|It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets outside, and ragged things behind for I dont know how many footmen to hold on by, and a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the temptation.
austen|I could not think about you so much without doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.
dickens|But he was down on the rank wet grass, filing at his iron like a madman, and not minding me or minding his own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but which he handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file.
austen|I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs Elton, by calling you Mr K.
austen|As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.
austen|The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.
dickens|When I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella in the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into the old  What?
dickens|And dont you think he knows that?
dickens|In all other respects, however, he was so composedly himself, that Mr Lorry determined to have the aid he sought.
dickens|March.
dickens|Much about the same, I should say.
dickens|No answer.
austen|I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you.
dickens|You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great expectations being encumbered with that easy condition.
dickens|We interchanged that confidence without shaping a syllable.
dickens|Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire.
dickens|Thats no question as it stands, you know.
dickens|On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice.
dickens|I thought how the same feeling had come back when I saw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stagecoach window; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like lightning, when I had passed in a carriagenot alonethrough a sudden glare of light in a dark street.
dickens|Mr Lorry was expected back presently from the Banking House.
dickens|All this was in a second.
dickens|But Wemmick was equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on, quite unconscious of his many rescues.
dickens|All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be.
dickens|On the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,full of bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,as he sat on one of the seaport mail coaches.
dickens|No objection.
austen|In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, Go to your father, he wants you in the library.
austen|Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.
austen|We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.
dickens|The child also, observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment of his words, has golden hair and blue eyes.
dickens|But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like it.
austen|His misfortunes!
austen|I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.
dickens|The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it.
dickens|When we got back, he had the hardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known I had done her so much honor, and to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the price of her death.
dickens|It was by the fingerpost at the end of the village, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, Goodbye, O my dear, dear friend!
austen|The lovers were standing together at one of the windows.
dickens|The news is of him.
austen|The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe.
dickens|On this hint we all rose to depart.
austen|There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one feels for Emma.
dickens|While he kept himself in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons, and among them of La Force.
austen|I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you.
dickens|As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp included us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was holding out both his hands to me.
dickens|Sarah Pocket then made her separate effect of departing with, Bless you, Miss Havisham dear!
austen|Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at once.
dickens|and not my London gentleman?
dickens|It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau.
dickens|The book itself had the appearance of having been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his knowledge of its antecedents, combined with his own experience in that wise, gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm.
dickens|A man, so besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air.
dickens|With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away.
dickens|I put out my hand, and Mr Wemmick at first looked at it as if he thought I wanted something.
austen|I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.
austen|You see we have been wedging one leg with paper.
austen|With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.
dickens|I derived from this, that Joes education, like Steam, was yet in its infancy.
austen|They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if possible.
austen|She need not trouble herself to pity him.
dickens|His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Darnays ears long after he had ceased.
dickens|The noise ceased at the sound of her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down together for a long time.
austen|Yes, he replied, and without the smallest apparent embarrassment.
dickens|I embrace this opportunity of remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or a dentist.
austen|Harriet Smith.
dickens|Shall you bring any fish home, father?
dickens|Where are you bound for?
austen|The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the poor little boys,  or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter near him, how beautifully Emma had written it.
austen|I will not say quite all.
dickens|In a word, I saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there before my eyes, and always had had her before my eyes; and I saw in this, the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden from the sun.
dickens|I charge myself with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him on his road.
austen|Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost enough to make me think so too.
dickens|Not only that, but I felt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and although she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging her as she really was to say nothing of Miss Estella before the contemplation of Mrs Joe.
austen|What is all settled?
austen|I never heard of such a thing.
austen|no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.
austen|I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.
austen|Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr Martins being no otherwise remembered, than as he furnished a contrast with Mr Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.
dickens|The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay, said the first.
dickens|I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my way through stone walls, and so can others.
austen|She directly replied  You need not be frightened.
dickens|If you are sure of what you say; if you really have the power you think you haveas I believe you havemake yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force.
austen|he cried, I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give, to be happy together.
austen|so gratified!
dickens|His cursed life is not his own!
austen|The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.
dickens|When I married your sister, sir, I said I will; and when I answered your friend, Pip, I said I am.
austen|What is all this?
dickens|Hear me out,but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I shall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would hardly do him justice.
dickens|And she has come back, a most beautiful and most elegant creature.
dickens|I misdealt, as was only natural, when I knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me for a stupid, clumsy laboringboy.
dickens|asked Herbert, who always presided of a morning.
dickens|You cannot love him, Estella!
austen|what has she to do with it?
austen|What do you mean?
austen|At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.
dickens|Two.
austen|I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible.
dickens|Youd be but a fierce young hound indeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched warmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint is!
austen|I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well.
dickens|And indeed she never did.
dickens|Whatshisnamed.
dickens|As the clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away.
austen|She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very feeling tone,  This is most kind, indeed!
dickens|said Monsieur Gabelle.
dickens|I says each time,and I goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens,but wot, if I gets liberty and money, Ill make that boy a gentleman!
dickens|There was a long hard time when I kept far from me the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth.
austen|They were invited, were not they?
dickens|How dare you?
austen|The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort of people, must be doing her harm.
austen|Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions.
dickens|Do you believe that he thinks of it much?
dickens|Yes, even so.
austen|He begged pardon for having displeased her.
dickens|Miss Manette, your mother took this course with you.
austen|He had expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty.
dickens|Do you know, Sydney, said Mr Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes, and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face do you know, I rather thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the goldenhaired doll, and were quick to see what happened to the goldenhaired doll?
dickens|Do you know what I touch here?
dickens|I am sure its not, said he, superciliously over his shoulder; I dont think anything about it.
dickens|But all this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home, and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed there could be no more room in it for any other theme.
dickens|Every drop, Jacques, answered Monsieur Defarge.
austen|What congratulations will then flow in!
dickens|I dont know, said the man.
dickens|Hallo, Joe.
dickens|The prisoners counsel was crossexamining this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him.
dickens|Never.
austen|There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.
dickens|But we didnt find that it come up to its likeness in the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay, added Joe, in an explanatory manner, as it is there drawd too architectooralooral.
austen|I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony.
dickens|It was the subject of the only determined resistance I made in all the wretched years.
dickens|Here they are!
dickens|Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend?
austen|Except, thought Elizabeth, when she goes to Ramsgate.
dickens|It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to be ashamed of anything, returned Sydney; you ought to be much obliged to me.
dickens|Youre a liar.
dickens|Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen, in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.
dickens|What have I done!
dickens|Ceptin Wopsle; hes had a drop.
austen|Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind.
austen|cried Mr Knightley.
austen|In Lydias imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.
dickens|It was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with Mr Wopsle on the walk home.
austen|As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different; but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.
dickens|It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after.
austen|I am going this moment.
dickens|My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us, that never varied.
austen|As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness.
dickens|Mr Pocket?
austen|As soon as Jane had read Mr Gardiners hope of Lydias being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.
austen|Mrs Stokes, said Ibut I had not time for more.
dickens|Mr Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.
dickens|How can you think of such a thing?
dickens|You are the young lady just now referred to?
dickens|My comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he had doubtless been transported a long way off, and that he was dead to me, and might be veritably dead into the bargain.
austen|They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hours visit, had revived.
austen|Isabella turned to Mrs Weston for her approbation of the plan.
dickens|He had heard of her going to the prison every day.
austen|You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.
austen|Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter, and said  Jane, I congratulate you.
dickens|Give us hold of the file, boy.
austen|I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.
dickens|For whats a doorchain when shes got one always up?
dickens|I thought you seemed as if you didnt like them?
austen|Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House.
austen|Better be without sense, than misapply it as you do.
dickens|Distant relation.
dickens|She came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer.
dickens|I take no answer from you.
dickens|Well, said he, I believe you.
dickens|Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning, he heard her say, I swear to you, like Evremonde!
austen|The children have been wanting me this half hour.
dickens|There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,not as being so chrisend, but as a surname.
dickens|I said Goodbye, Miss Pocket; but she merely stared, and did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken.
dickens|At our own door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party escorted by her little lover; and I envied her little lover, in spite of his being subject to Flopson.
dickens|And look here!
dickens|For, I am not a bad witness.
austen|Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you.
dickens|You do not, sir, said William.
austen|I had.
dickens|Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to ask it?
austen|It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it.
dickens|Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of winebut, he took less than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no rarityand stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.
austen|Emma was not sorry to be pressed.
austen|In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.
austen|The rest I leave to you.
dickens|I have an impression that they were to be contributed eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt, but I know I had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.
dickens|The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a tearing down into Compeysons parlor late at night, in only a flannel gown, with his hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeysons wife, Sally, she really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I cant get rid of her.
austen|Cramer.
dickens|Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocketbook by Herbert, to hold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfactionwhether it was a false kind or a true, I hardly knowin not having profited by his generosity since his revelation of himself.
dickens|He sat by a newlylighted wood fire the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold, and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the room distortedly reflecta shade of horror.
dickens|The late stress upon me had enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that it was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even careless as to that.
austen|Depend upon it, a man of six or sevenandtwenty can take care of himself.
dickens|She laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.
dickens|Have another glass!
dickens|Engaged.
austen|Emma looked at her, quite unable to speak.
austen|He has heartily forgiven me now.
austen|I am astonished, said Miss Bingley, that my father should have left so small a collection of books.
austen|She could think of nothing but of Mr Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr Collins were once silent.
dickens|It was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house had told me so.
austen|You said you had a great many, and now you have not one left.
dickens|Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.
austen|Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not immediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could not anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.
austen|For Mrs Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.
dickens|Never mind about happening, Mr Lorry.
austen|Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr Knightley, than with Frank Churchill?
austen|I shall speak to Mr E.
austen|By all means, if you can.
dickens|It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words aloud under the fastsailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of negligence than defiance.
austen|As Mrs Weston observed, all young people would have their little whims.
austen|I must beg to return to the house.
austen|But why all this secrecy?
austen|Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love.
austen|I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on.
dickens|The murdered woman,more a match for the man, certainly, in point of yearswas found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath.
austen|You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of the poor husband.
dickens|The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in Fleetstreet.
austen|With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively, with the real goodwill of a mind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests.
dickens|You, so young, untried, and beautiful, Estella!
dickens|He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.
dickens|Lucie was to be married tomorrow.
austen|We have been sitting with your fatherglad to see him so well.
austen|Such a countenance, such manners!
austen|Yeswhat should hurt me?
austen|Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself.
dickens|One year and three months.
dickens|Who was called accordingly.
dickens|As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became again charged with mist and vapour, Mr Lorrys thoughts seemed to cloud too.
dickens|She looked an old woman, but was young.
dickens|I never shall forget the radiant face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a mighty piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker the young merchants name, and of Clarrikers having shown an extraordinary inclination towards him, and of his belief that the opening had come at last.
dickens|After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr Lorry, who had stood up to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.
austen|I did not know what to do.
dickens|so you kiss my hand as if I were a queen, eh?
austen|That will do, said he, when it was finished, thinking aloudyou have sung quite enough for one eveningnow be quiet.
dickens|Perhaps if I warnt a blacksmiths wife, and whats the same thing a slave with her apron never off, I should have been to hear the Carols,  said Mrs Joe.
dickens|he continued, after rubbing his knees a little, when you do come to a J and a O, and says you, Here, at last, is a JO, Joe, how interesting reading is!
dickens|Yaha!
austen|He sat musing a little while, and then said,  But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon, though he does.
austen|To be sitting long after dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure.
dickens|Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.
austen|Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained.
austen|He cannot know what Mr Darcy is.
dickens|What was she a doing of, when you went in today?
austen|and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time.
austen|For half an hour Mr Weston was surprized and sorry; but then he began to perceive that Franks coming two or three months later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner.
austen|On Saturday he came again.
dickens|That she had done a grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form that her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found vengeance in, I knew full well.
dickens|I live quite pleasantly there; at least It appeared to me that I was losing a chance.
austen|Impossible, Mr Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?
dickens|You had better see, he carelessly answered; and took up a light.
dickens|in a cheery shout.
austen|He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a little from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss Fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.
dickens|By and by, I noticed Wemmicks arm beginning to disappear again, and gradually fading out of view.
austen|The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.
austen|I can never think of it, she cried, without extreme shame.
austen|I shall talk about it to him; he will settle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.
austen|Her parting look was gratefuland her parting words, Oh!
dickens|I was not so sure of that.
dickens|There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour.
dickens|said Wemmick, contemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened; theres a nod for you; giving him a tremendous one; theres another for you;  giving him a still more tremendous one; you like that, dont you?
austen|then, dont speak it, dont speak it, she eagerly cried.
austen|said Emma, laughing.
austen|But she was not wanted to speak.
austen|No, she had had enough of interference.
dickens|We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir.
dickens|It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the mental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon me that tomorrow was.
austen|I know not, Miss Elizabeth, said he, whether Mrs Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.
dickens|Of the men, the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many knitted.
austen|How is Mr Woodhouse?
dickens|he went on.
austen|Ten couple may stand here very well.
dickens|Ill walk with you to her gate.
austen|She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said  By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?
dickens|Which, by the way, was more than he could do himself.
austen|Mrs Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!
dickens|And are always a getting stronger, old chap?
austen|You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it.
austen|Agreed, agreed.
dickens|Then, the two nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly lost half his buttons at the gamingtable.
dickens|He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice, after a pause  Will you answer his question to me then?
dickens|I have observed his face.
dickens|I could not reply at the moment, for my voice failed me.
dickens|All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet, are always turning up, said Miss Pross.
austen|Nothing child, nothing.
dickens|We ought to have six score a day.
dickens|Good!
austen|On his side, there had been a longstanding jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation, of Frank Churchill.
austen|She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never complains, I dare not depend.
austen|You do us a great deal of honour today, I am sure.
dickens|Why dont I rise?
austen|She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years.
austen|Mr Eltons manners are not perfect, replied Emma; but where there is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great deal.
dickens|My meaning is that I am a man, said Stryver, inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, who cares more to be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how to be agreeable, in a womans society, than you do.
austen|Those were Miss Woodhouses words, were they?
dickens|I was not at all remorseful for having unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor arts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural bent, and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them slumbering.
austen|Mr Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavyexcept when it has been quite an influenza.
dickens|As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I remarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid of me.
dickens|He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, A long imprisonment.
austen|It is, I believe, too little yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the world.
dickens|He is more in the secrets of every place, I think, said Estella, in a low voice.
austen|The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above.
austen|I will tell you.
austen|The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her shouldersand it makes one think she must catch cold.
austen|I shall think you a great blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.
dickens|It may have been about a month after my sisters reappearance in the kitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the whole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.
austen|She did it all herself.
austen|I am very sure you did me good.
dickens|There is no man in this world on whom I could so rely for right guidance, as on you.
austen|I hardly know how it has happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was, by her aunt and grandmother, and all their set.
austen|made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already.
dickens|They aint so easy concerning me here, dear boy,wouldnt be, leastwise, if they knowed where I was.
dickens|On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should beunless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligationkept inviolate between them.
austen|It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had she deemed it possible enough for wishing.
dickens|The necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets, was another relief.
austen|On their first coming into the country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of meansthe house in town had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them.
austen|The young man had been the first admirer, but she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no serious difficulty, on Harriets side, to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own.
austen|I am sick of Mr Bingley, cried his wife.
dickens|Be sure you are there, my soul, said The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the street, before the tumbrils arrive!
dickens|The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he struck.
dickens|You want to be the death of me.
dickens|I am not fit to be pitted against you tonight.
dickens|Beat it out, beat it outOld Clem!
austen|She looked back as well as she could; but it was all confusion.
dickens|Say that again!
dickens|It is a painful reflection to me, said Charles Darnay, quite astounded, that I should have done him any wrong.
austen|He is gone to my father already.
dickens|Why, they would have it so!
dickens|I answered, Pretty well, sir, and my sister shook her fist at me.
dickens|It is impossible to be gentler, Herbert.
dickens|repeated my sister.
dickens|Ill give you punch, and not bad punch.
dickens|Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at, and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him goas a cat might have done to a mouseand silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready, and while he besought her the women passionately screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth.
dickens|When the waiter had felt my fastcooling teapot with the palm of his hand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle, careful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocket and bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring.
dickens|Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers, looking at his friend.
dickens|Thats all, old chap, and dont never do it no more.
austen|I am disappointed, was his only answer.
dickens|The pale young gentlemans nose had stained my trousers, and I tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night.
dickens|I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept nothing.
dickens|Six tumbrils roll along the streets.
austen|I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry.
dickens|If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the love of the man you see before yourselfflung away, wasted, drunken, poor creature of misuse as you know him to behe would have been conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you, disgrace you, pull you down with him.
austen|Emma scarcely heard what was said.
dickens|Spies!
dickens|For some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should come back.
dickens|Having written to Joe, to offer him consolation, and to assure him that I would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in the curious state of mind I have glanced at.
dickens|However, go to Miss Havishams I must, and go I did.
austen|While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either.
austen|You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.
austen|The more I think of it, the more probable it appears.
dickens|Which was, I suppose, as false a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for her then, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards.
austen|We removed to Windsor; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters all returned!
dickens|The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like a regular member of the establishment.
austen|Yet it did, and even a third.
austen|I admire all that quaint, oldfashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease; modern ease often disgusts me.
dickens|I expect nothing!
austen|Have not you always hated him?
dickens|Him and me was soon busy, and first he swore me being ever artful on my own book,this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade on.
austen|Think of me tomorrow, my dear Emma, about four oclock, was Mrs Westons parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only for her.
austen|Mr Elton, I must beg leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on.
austen|Success supposes endeavour.
austen|I never shall forget his manner.
austen|Mrs Weston could only approve.
austen|No, I do not know that Mr Wingfield considers it very sickly except  Ah!
dickens|Among the loungers under the Boars archway happened to be Trabbs Boy,true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no business,and Trabbs boy had seen me passing from Miss Havishams in the direction of my diningplace.
dickens|Her first act was to shut them.
austen|He sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his treesI believe there is two of them.
dickens|Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between her and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and there were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance.
austen|I shall be no support to Mrs Weston.
dickens|Nor is that all; my house has been destroyedrazed to the ground.
austen|A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air.
dickens|So I kissed his hand, and lay quiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in it.
dickens|When I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his labors by sweeping over me.
austen|Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again.
dickens|Of her having the pleasure, I added.
dickens|Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?
austen|In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either.
dickens|It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!
dickens|Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saints mercies.
dickens|Herbert said from behind again poking me, Massive and concrete.
austen|You will be a very happy woman.
dickens|The chamber, furnished bachelorfashion, that you wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the fifth floor.
austen|Do not give way to useless alarm, added he; though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
austen|I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I hope I am not often so illequipped.
dickens|I remember it all very well.
austen|With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family.
dickens|It comes slowly.
austen|Dear Mrs Weston, how could you think of such a thing?
austen|The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr Westons nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed, so deservedly dear.
austen|Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,  You are very kindbut you are mistakenand I must set you right.
dickens|The boys eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the lookeron, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true.
dickens|I laid it there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.
austen|There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.
austen|Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?
austen|I have found out, said he, by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness.
austen|and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner.
austen|It is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.
dickens|The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not be answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his men should make towards it at the double.
dickens|I say!
austen|Harriet said, very true, and she would not think about it; but still she talked of itstill she could talk of nothing else; and Emma, at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to hurry on the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender caution; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harrietsuch a conclusion of Mr Eltons importance with her!
dickens|It was only my head and my legs that I could move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until then unknown, that was within me.
dickens|So was his daughter.
dickens|Oh!
austen|His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear  I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball.
dickens|I was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the right man,hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never all night left off hugging and limping,waiting for me.
austen|But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr Darcy walk into the room.
dickens|Massive?
dickens|I accidentally heard, yesterday morning, said Wemmick, being in a certain place where I once took you,even between you and me, its as well not to mention names when avoidable  Much better not, said I.
dickens|Have you finished your repast, friend?
austen|Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no female connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella.
austen|They were all disengaged and all happy.
dickens|She is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she feels the better for being out of court.
dickens|exclaimed the man with the bloated face.
austen|What!
austen|How do you like it?
dickens|I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange letter.
dickens|So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for the moment I lose sight, touching the back of the Doctors chair, even of this distress.
dickens|The young lady is Miss Manette.
dickens|He was smoother and more polite to me than the elder; but I saw this.
dickens|They had conferred together until the last moment, when it was necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat.
dickens|Do you want anything?
dickens|He is always at it.
dickens|Sounding Mr Cruncher, and finding him of her opinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, attended by her cavalier.
austen|Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my soninlaw.
dickens|And but for his illness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a determined prisonbreaker, and I know not what else.
dickens|I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that even if Provis were recognized and taken, in spite of himself, I should be wretched as the cause, however innocently.
dickens|His words had given me a start.
austen|If Mrs Gilbert wishes to dance, said he, I shall have great pleasure, I am surefor, though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs Gilbert.
dickens|Well!
dickens|You may well say churchyard, you two.
austen|Was not she like a daughter, his eldest daughter?
dickens|The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm, and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs.
austen|It is such a happiness when good people get togetherand they always do.
austen|He was generally thought so.
dickens|And yet, said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and waiter, and pointing me out at arms length, this is him as I ever sported with in his days of happy infancy!
dickens|Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of Truth.
dickens|Be careful of my friend, I entreat you, and leave me.
austen|Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr Frank Churchills not coming, except as a disappointment at Randalls.
austen|that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin.
austen|Oh!
austen|I am the less surprised at what has happened, replied Sir William, from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.
austen|I am happy you approved, said Emma, smiling; but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.
austen|I thought I had seen you first in February.
dickens|Aaabusiness, business!
austen|Mrs Hill began instantly to express her joy.
austen|They will have their barouchelandau, of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of our carriage, we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well.
austen|Yes, believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme.
dickens|Come.
dickens|Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr Lorry replied, No, no, no.
dickens|Mrs Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, This is that odious Sophias doing!
austen|He was very much vexed.
austen|I shall see her in January.
dickens|Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?
austen|The chances are that she must be a gainer.
dickens|Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.
dickens|It was much harder work now, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed and rowed until the sun went down.
austen|He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on, by all his fathers doubts, to say that her complaints were merely imaginary, or that she was as strong as ever.
austen|Exactly so, indeed.
dickens|Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several times; and then my mother shed go out to work, and shed say, Joe,  shed say, now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child, and shed put me to school.
dickens|I am empowered to mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by word of mouth to yourself.
austen|This proves that he can leave the Churchills.
austen|what is the matter?
austen|The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.
dickens|We are in our private and personal capacities, of course.
austen|Have you any other objection, said Elizabeth, than your belief of my indifference?
austen|You seem determined to think ill of him.
dickens|I resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond to it.
austen|Mr Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young mans spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant.
dickens|Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, or Hebrew, or all threeor all one to mefor enough.
austen|I did not expect such a compliment.
austen|Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.
dickens|It will take a little time.
dickens|At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open mouth and dropped underjaw, looked awestricken.
austen|Emma listened with the warmest concern; grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful.
austen|I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably settled.
austen|All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light.
dickens|I leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.
austen|He perfectly agreed with her and after walking together so long, and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him, that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting.
dickens|The last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate!
dickens|Let me finish wot I was a telling you, dear boy.
austen|I am sure, but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost, to dare to think of him.
dickens|Mr Crunchers temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast.
dickens|I am ignorant what may become of me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go.
dickens|The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which was a species of loft over a stable.
austen|The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr Knightley and Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emmas feelings, and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriets side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis, No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin, that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature.
dickens|O!
austen|There is no comparison between them.
austen|Oh!
austen|Emma was most agreeably surprized.
austen|Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her?
dickens|Pip, Pip, she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; will you never take warning?
dickens|I dont care for what you say at all.
austen|I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together.
austen|Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect approbation ofand it then appeared that Mrs Weston was wanting him to dance with Mrs Elton himself, and that their business was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.
austen|Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.
dickens|And I took him down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there, and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the memory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above.
dickens|You made mention of the young lady as a goldenhaired doll.
dickens|Ask him, is that so.
austen|She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might be, and must be.
dickens|To Satis House, as usual.
austen|Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.
dickens|I am putting a case.
austen|This, you know, speaks a great degree of weaknessbut now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.
dickens|He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr Lorrys face.
austen|A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.
austen|Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough.
austen|My dear Mr E.
dickens|returned Flopson, very red in the face; what have you got there?
dickens|Look at me.
austen|The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.
dickens|Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators.
austen|I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning.
dickens|I will not allow anybody to interfere, said Mrs Pocket.
austen|Shall I ring the bell?
dickens|Ah!
dickens|Do you call yourself a mother, and not know that a mothers first duty is to blow her boy out?
austen|She could not think of Darcys leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.
austen|The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so.
austen|It had not been forgotten before, but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day.
dickens|hi!
austen|I hardly know how Mr Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.
dickens|I highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw; with the queerest gothic windows by far the greater part of them sham, and a gothic door almost too small to get in at.
dickens|Sighs of the winds that blew over a little gardentomb were mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed murmurlike the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shoreas the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or dressing a doll at her mothers footstool, chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life.
austen|John Knightley only was in mute astonishment.
dickens|Goodbye, Joe!
dickens|In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose depreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree, until he became downright intolerable.
austen|Mrs Elton had received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures.
dickens|For now, the very breath of the beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be softened as they thought of me.
austen|But you forget, mamma, said Elizabeth, that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs Long promised to introduce him.
austen|There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.
austen|It will be giving him so much pleasure!
dickens|Mr Jaggers, said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else, has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place than any man in London.
austen|Conjectureaye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one conjectures wrong.
dickens|They fished with a spade, at first.
dickens|Biddy, pursued Joe, when I got home and asked her fur to write the message to you, a little hung back.
dickens|As he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him.
dickens|He started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.
austen|Of Mr Collins and Lizzy.
austen|This was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.
austen|I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about courtplaister, one of the very last times we ever met in it!
dickens|Indictment delivered to him last night.
austen|Such a transformation!
dickens|His unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped to lay him in his coffin.
austen|Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before her!
dickens|We had a hot supper on the occasion, graced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish with.
austen|Pray do not talk of that odious man.
austen|She could not endure its noise.
austen|Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright.
dickens|Come, then!
austen|Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty.
dickens|I begged Mr Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or hinted, on that point.
austen|You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slavetrade, I assure you Mr Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition.
dickens|In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something between a publican and a ratcatchera large pale, puffed, swollen manwas attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby appearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to be treated who contributed to Mr Jaggerss coffers.
dickens|But our Defarge, said Jacques Three, is undoubtedly a good Republican?
dickens|Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!
dickens|You had not your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed and defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that is soft and soothing.
austen|He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet exactly; it will be an Exactly so, as he says himself; but he does sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal.
austen|Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?
dickens|My Spy will find a place for me.
austen|Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.
dickens|I adjure you, do not recall that!
austen|But here is my father coming you will not object to my reading the charade to him.
austen|Well, I wish them happy with all my heart.
dickens|I arrived at Mr Lorrys, to his surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother.
dickens|Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing.
dickens|The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellsons establishment was put through the door, and the word was given  Porter wanted!
dickens|Yes, dear Joe, quite.
dickens|Avoiding forbidden ground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of one person naming no person all my expectations depend.
dickens|The worst.
dickens|It is not possible to know how far the influence of any amiable honesthearted dutydoing man flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it has touched ones self in going by, and I know right well that any good that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Joe, and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.
dickens|I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play.
dickens|As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I going to be?
dickens|However, I proposed that he and I should walk away together to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take us aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about noon.
austen|but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.
austen|Dixon in them.
austen|There was no occasion to press the matter farther.
austen|She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to place himself elsewhere.
dickens|You were always driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose.
austen|I wish I could say anything to comfort you, replied Elizabeth; but it is wholly out of my power.
dickens|Surely a curious thing.
dickens|Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
dickens|Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.
dickens|His indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr Lorry; his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had broken under the weight of his foot.
dickens|While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the Jackwho was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes on, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a drowned seaman washed ashoreasked me if we had seen a fouroared galley going up with the tide?
dickens|We used to walk between the two places at all hours.
dickens|Thatll do.
austen|There can be no doubt of that.
dickens|No other attendant than the housekeeper appeared.
austen|I do not think we were speaking at all.
austen|I would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your raising your thoughts to him, is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value.
dickens|Not absolutely always, for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few and slight, and she believed them over.
austen|They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs and Miss Bates.
austen|I must speak to my uncle.
austen|It was a dislike so little justevery imputed fault was so magnified by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.
dickens|But it was not to be done.
austen|She recalled her past kindnessthe kindness, the affection of sixteen yearshow she had taught and how she had played with her from five years oldhow she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in healthand how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood.
austen|I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.
dickens|Monseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hillside, head first, as a person plunges into the river.
austen|Oh!
dickens|It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however undesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise.
dickens|I whimpered, I dont know.
dickens|So he and Startop arrived at the Blue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but, finding neither, went on to Miss Havishams, where they lost me.
dickens|Miss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor, among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn.
austen|The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.
austen|As a magistrate, he had generally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the homefarm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next year, and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life, and whose attachments were strong.
dickens|That somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence.
austen|Ladies can never look ill.
austen|She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had dwelt on them to her more than once.
austen|The fate of thousands.
dickens|Mr Stryver was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.
dickens|That, it was certain the prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England, on secret business of which he could give no honest account.
dickens|Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then began to be audible.
dickens|But you dont know what it is.
dickens|In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight, coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father.
austen|He told me at parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now.
dickens|Now, said a suppressed voice with an oath, Ive got you!
austen|I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.
austen|Oh!
dickens|Mr Lorrys countenance fell.
dickens|It was taken to pieces, like a toypuzzle for a young Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it.
austen|He had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults, bore the discovery.
dickens|Then, why should I go there?
austen|And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them.
dickens|In his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.
dickens|Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy to me.
austen|cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished.
dickens|Yes I am, said Joe.
dickens|This is my little bedroom; rather musty, but Barnards is musty.
austen|How little did I think!
austen|It was a right thing to do.
austen|Mermaids and sharks!
dickens|Yes, maam; I could do that, if I was wanted.
austen|She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr Darcythat Mr Darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week.
austen|Nay, how could I help saying what I did?
austen|He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, I will give it to hershall I?
austen|What a thinking brain you have!
dickens|He slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished work, were all as usual.
dickens|Indeed?
austen|I shall hear about you all, said he; that is my chief consolation.
austen|Do come with me, said Mrs Weston, if it be not very disagreeable to you.
austen|for, if we had met first in the drawingroom, I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.
austen|My playing is no more like hers, than a lamp is like sunshine.
dickens|A deserting soldier in a Travellers Rest, what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs, learnt me to read; and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me to write.
austen|And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is!
austen|The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully.
dickens|I said, couldnt you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieurs information?
dickens|observed Defarge.
dickens|I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to understand that my help must always be rendered without Herberts knowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise.
dickens|She had only a bruise or two about her,nothing for a tramp,but the backs of her hands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with fingernails?
austen|How are they, sir?
dickens|We giv him the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap, said Joe, delighted, when I took another stool by the childs side but I did not rumple his hair, and we hoped he might grow a little bit like you, and we think he do.
dickens|When we got back again, and he lifted me out, and carried meso easily!
dickens|Keep it.
dickens|And how are you?
dickens|This is your bedroom; the furnitures hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer the purpose; if you should want anything, Ill go and fetch it.
austen|How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!
dickens|So much more wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month, that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares under the southern wintry sun.
austen|Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be found if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true peace for herself.
dickens|And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly crossed his legs.
austen|Let me first see how he behaves, said she; it will then be early enough for expectation.
austen|no, the meeting is certainly today, was the abrupt answer, which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs Eltons side.
dickens|Several doors were opened in succession, and finally his own.
dickens|You will please consider me your guardian.
dickens|He moved a chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said in a subdued voice,  Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I recommended that your aid should be invited.
dickens|In a dead silence and stillnessthe prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of themthe paper was read, as follows.
dickens|Christened Pip?
dickens|I do not possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of intelligence; I want guiding.
dickens|Lord strike me dead!
dickens|It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of Providence.
dickens|said Mr Wemmick to me.
dickens|Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?
dickens|No, old chap.
austen|to Miss Lydia Bennet, without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
austen|I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if we could be shaken together.
austen|Pray be sincere, Knightley.
dickens|He kept his very looks to himself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estellas face once during dinner.
austen|Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing.
austen|The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone.
dickens|He was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone on, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.
austen|She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.
austen|It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Janes answer; but she positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her; she would waitand, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go.
dickens|Miss Sarah Pocket came to the gate.
dickens|What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I do.
austen|replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.
dickens|He imitated the action of a mans being impelled forward by the buttends of muskets.
austen|It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she really did not seem to feel it.
austen|You have no compassion for my poor nerves.
dickens|The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night.
austen|He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.
austen|This is saying very plainlyPray, Miss Smith, give me leave to pay my addresses to you.
austen|Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr Eltons marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make me.
austen|Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.
austen|He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.
dickens|Yes.
dickens|It was characteristic of the police people that they had all more or less suspected poor Joe though he never knew it, and that they had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits they had ever encountered.
dickens|said Defarge, in a determined voice, are we ready?
austen|You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her.
austen|I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.
dickens|This is an occasion that makes a man speculate on all he has lost.
austen|I am not equal to it.
dickens|Hooroar, father!
austen|She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now.
dickens|Dont evade the question.
austen|I will think no more about him.
dickens|Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings, dyeworks, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless trees.
austen|Not that I think Charlotte so very plainbut then she is our particular friend.
austen|You remember those linesI forget the poem at this moment          For when a ladys in the case,         You know all other things give place.
dickens|Mr Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did his shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavor about the corduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and flavor about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I hardly knew which was which.
dickens|That his age was about sixty.
austen|I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.
austen|It is a sad change indeed.
dickens|For a moment I looked wildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none.
dickens|The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and runninghidingdoing anything but stopping.
austen|He will think all the happiness, all the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit on mine.
dickens|How do you do?
dickens|said he.
dickens|I believe she had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all the susceptibility she possessed certainly came out then, and she passionately loved him.
dickens|It appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched were incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning.
dickens|These are two celebrated ones.
austen|But Mr Knightley does not want to marry.
austen|However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it overbut these sort of things require a good deal of consideration.
dickens|Two tonight, I think.
dickens|As the days wore on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell, my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before tomorrow morning altogether mastered me.
austen|You must go, said she.
austen|While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.
austen|Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.
austen|engaged to her all the winterbefore either of them came to Highbury?
austen|With respect to her father, it was a question soon answered.
dickens|Let it be read.
dickens|There.
austen|I do not pretend to Emmas genius for foretelling and guessing.
dickens|With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joes broad shoulder, I looked all about for any sign of the convicts.
austen|That is right.
dickens|Laws of the game!
dickens|Why?
dickens|There being still no answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what to do.
austen|She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the way to any such subject.
austen|cried Emma, putting her hand before her face, and jumping up, you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.
dickens|He had his boatcloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a natural part of the scene.
dickens|And by George, sir, its a thing worth mentioning, that of all the people who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known to the Aged, Miss Skiffins, and me!
dickens|She took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase, and still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.
dickens|She turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and presented herself at the carriagedoor.
austen|This letter must make its way to Emmas feelings.
austen|Emma saw Mrs Westons surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose.
austen|He knows where we live.
dickens|Mr Lorry sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs not far from a wigged gentleman, the prisoners counsel, who had a great bundle of papers before him and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr Cruncher looked at him then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court.
dickens|Then, said I, after all, stopping short here, never taking another penny from him, think what I owe him already!
austen|in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined.
dickens|Mr Jaggerss eyes retired a little deeper into his head when I handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick, with instructions to draw the check for his signature.
austen|He will find an addition to the society of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume to call myself an addition.
dickens|Many a moral for the young, returned Mr Wopsle,and I knew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; might be deduced from that text.
austen|They were in  street.
dickens|Of course, or girl, Mr Hubble, assented Mr Wopsle, rather irritably, but there is no girl present.
dickens|The delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact and kindness with which Biddywho with her womans wit had found me out so soonhad prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind.
dickens|At night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had done all through my recovery.
dickens|He was plainly dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out of his way than for ornament.
dickens|Dont take it so much amiss, sir, pleaded the keeper to the angry passenger; Ill sit next you myself.
austen|said she.
austen|Donwell Lane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry.
austen|After a short silence, the lady first spoke.
austen|I admire all my three sonsinlaw highly, said he.
dickens|Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her blood all chilled, What shall I do!
dickens|We will say, to put a case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad time, to work at a little forge.
austen|Vanity, extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became liable to all these charges.
dickens|Used not!
austen|Emma encouraged her talkativenessamused by such a picture of another set of beings, and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs Martins having two parlours, two very good parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs Goddards drawingroom; and of her having an upper maid who had lived fiveandtwenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed; and of Mrs Martins saying as she was so fond of it, it should be called her cow; and of their having a very handsome summerhouse in their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink teaa very handsome summerhouse, large enough to hold a dozen people.
austen|What is to be done, my dear Emma?
dickens|A man cant help his feelings, Mr Wemmick, pleaded Mike.
dickens|He knows it.
dickens|As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words, which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly.
dickens|Joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman.
dickens|I dont know what he had looked like, except a funeral; with the addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue ribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary Fire Office.
austen|It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.
dickens|I dont think I should have done so, if I had been Miss Havisham.
austen|For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriets, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr Eltons nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to.
austen|I dare say she had.
austen|Does not she, Jane?
austen|But I gave what I believed the general opinion, when I called him plain.
austen|You refuse, then, to oblige me.
austen|Emma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned.
austen|It was a bad business.
dickens|Evremonde, we are pressed.
dickens|Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on, that first day, until it was too dark to seeworked on, half an hour after Mr Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.
dickens|Estella returned, and she too remained quiet.
austen|Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to, pursued only by the sounds of her desultory goodwill.
dickens|But I alighted at the Halfway House, and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for I sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to leave it in the same manner.
dickens|He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.
austen|She made her plan; she would speak of something totally differentthe children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for breath to begin, when Mr Knightley startled her, by saying,  You will not ask me what is the point of envy.
austen|And what sort of young lady is she?
dickens|echoed Biddy.
dickens|Well then, as to Old Orlick, hes a going up town, retorted that worthy.
dickens|I wont have my wittles blest off my table.
austen|The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took themselves off in a hurry.
dickens|Which you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear old chap?
austen|You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr Darcy.
austen|How nicely we are all crammed in, cried Lydia.
dickens|Bed, sir?
dickens|While he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and then died away.
dickens|Did I never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all times, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me!
dickens|Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our dwellingplace, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me sir, Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat,as if it were only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a resting place,and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the chimneypiece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.
austen|is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W.
dickens|They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for explanation in his friends ashy face.
austen|Not for the world, said Emma, smiling graciously, would I advise you either way.
dickens|How has this been done, monsieur?
austen|You cannot mean that he has even proposed to her againyet.
austen|In everything else she is as goodnatured a girl as ever lived.
dickens|The watchman had not particularly noticed; he should say a working person; to the best of his belief, he had a dustcolored kind of clothes on, under a dark coat.
dickens|He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he said that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on Englands part.
dickens|Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or vagrants of any sort, out there?
dickens|And if it does come, while we live to see it triumphI hope, for her sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France.
austen|Mr Collinss return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs Bennet.
austen|In the diningroom they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before.
austen|How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved.
austen|never seen him in her life before, and call him Knightley!
austen|No, replied Jane, I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you.
austen|Oh!
dickens|Poor soul!
austen|Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.
dickens|It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on that night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on the chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram at the door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had perceptibly been dining out?
dickens|Greatly changed, it is too probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best.
austen|This was invitation enough.
dickens|Sometimes, I have sat here of an evening, until I have fanciedbut even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder tonight, when all is so black and solemn  Let us shudder too.
austen|There is something a little stately in him, to be sure, replied her aunt, but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.
austen|Oh!
austen|Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him.
dickens|If you will hear me through a very little more, all you can ever do for me is done.
dickens|As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the Carmagnole.
dickens|I am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty.
austen|Henceforward I know nothing of the matter.
dickens|Instead of going straight to the gate, too, she stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.
austen|I should not mind anything at all.
dickens|So expressive it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller, wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.
dickens|Can I feed them?
dickens|Opening this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner.
austen|At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the evil day, when they must all be together again.
dickens|No, not you!
austen|Never had the exquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her.
dickens|I had the honour of being passed on the road.
austen|They then went away.
austen|One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in, she said, was that of making her unreasonable.
dickens|I was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum.
austen|My dear aunt, how could you think of it?
dickens|Ah, my cherished!
austen|Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the diningroom, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.
dickens|I am already quite an old bachelor.
dickens|Im a going, said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a heavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,Im a going to have your life!
dickens|The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not sooner?
dickens|Good!
dickens|What would you have?
austen|You have liked many a stupider person.
austen|In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.
austen|Oh, Lydia!
austen|It is his companion all this evening, his solace, his delight.
dickens|S.
dickens|As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.
dickens|They may not be worth much, but, after all, theyre property and portable.
austen|Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased.
dickens|Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shook her head again.
austen|At this moment whom are you thinking of?
austen|Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of.
austen|But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult.
dickens|What a hopeful disposition you have!
dickens|Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room, and was in the courtyard when Mr Lorry regained the blind.
austen|Nothing can be more simple, you see.
austen|His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.
dickens|That sausage you toasted was his, and he was in all respects a firstrater.
dickens|Almost eighteen years.
dickens|I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope.
dickens|And when youre well enough to go out for a ridewhat larks!
dickens|Do you keep a dog?
austen|Miss Woodhouse!
austen|She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present.
austen|But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting.
dickens|Good night, good night!
dickens|The condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to require, I will observe immediately.
austen|And she appears so truly goodthere is something so motherly and kindhearted about her, that it wins upon one directly.
austen|You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.
austen|But two such offers in one day!
austen|As to his going, it was inevitable.
austen|I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the sideglass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.
dickens|My guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched, standing, from a sandwichbox and a pocketflask of sherry he seemed to bully his very sandwich as he ate it, informed me what arrangements he had made for me.
austen|A clear ten thousand per annum.
austen|Give my love to Colonel Forster.
dickens|It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground.
dickens|I had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the boat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot.
dickens|Giv him by friends, I expect.
austen|Yes, indeed, a very good letter, replied Emma rather slowlyso good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his sisters must have helped him.
austen|These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.
austen|I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself.
dickens|Christian name?
austen|He really is engaged from morning to night.
austen|At present, I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.
austen|He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlaw said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
dickens|As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, This is our man.
dickens|I even believe itin some casesto be quite impossible.
dickens|Upon which Mrs Pocket laughed and said, Thank you, Flopson, and settling herself in one chair only, resumed her book.
dickens|I come in behind yourself.
dickens|Indeed I am lost here.
austen|There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.
austen|And with a bow to Mr Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.
dickens|Barsad, said another voice, striking in.
austen|She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.
dickens|Besides being possessed by my sisters idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted to my diet,besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm water into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out altogether,his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic.
dickens|Estella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on.
austen|I shall never be invited to AbbeyMill again, was said in rather a sorrowful tone.
austen|Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr Bingley and Netherfield.
dickens|But it took a bit of time to get it well round, the change come so oncommon plump; didnt it?
austen|Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted.
austen|Ah!
dickens|You know, Mr Pip,  pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, the new schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you after that time, and have had time since then to improve.
dickens|Why, you are crying!
dickens|From such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions.
austen|They came.
austen|Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr Darcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.
austen|My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.
austen|I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs Weston.
austen|Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr Darcy.
dickens|Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty?
dickens|Now, Ill put you in a corner, forensically shaking a forefinger at him.
austen|You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.
dickens|Out of the wineshop into the street, out of the street into a courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the staircase into a garretformerly the garret where a whitehaired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.
dickens|Says you, Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now repeat.
dickens|When I had got all my responsibilities down upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off.
dickens|Before we got to the street door, Startop was cheerily calling Drummle old boy, as if nothing had happened.
dickens|Well, Pip!
austen|express perfection!
dickens|From me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.
dickens|It will suit you to a marvel.
dickens|As it turned out, however, that he only wanted me for a dramatic layfigure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways, I soon declined that course of instruction; though not until Mr Wopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me.
austen|said Frank Churchill.
dickens|Yes.
dickens|Come!
dickens|He lodged at a sluicekeepers out on the marshes, and on workingdays would come slouching from his hermitage, with his hands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck and dangling on his back.
dickens|So at least you say he may have been one of them?
dickens|It will seem nothing to you.
austen|Mrs Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs Bennet and Mrs Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.
austen|If all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must be comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness.
austen|He must have a pretty good opinion of himself.
dickens|He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it.
austen|think a farmer, and with all his sense and all his merit Mr Martin is nothing more, a good match for my intimate friend!
austen|Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention.
dickens|If I had never known him out of Little Britain, and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the Castle, I might have doubted him; not so for a moment, knowing him as I did.
austen|And I have another favour to ask you.
austen|She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat Mrs Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr Perry was talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not speak of her loss without many tears.
dickens|Not well from here; but I think I see it.
dickens|At length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but in an instant, Miss Havisham said, Let me see you two play cards; why have you not begun?
dickens|Shes a Tartar.
dickens|Did your client commit the robbery?
dickens|The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the street at the saddler, who appeared to transact his business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to get on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating the baker, who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer, who stood at his door and yawned at the chemist.
austen|I do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet.
austen|How very odd!
dickens|He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but another man!
austen|Poor old John, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father twentyseven years; and now, poor old man, he is bedridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his jointsI must go and see him today; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all.
dickens|I have altogether perished from the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a blank.
austen|He left them immediately afterwardsgone in a moment.
austen|It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it.
dickens|Not at all!
dickens|Exactly, said I; but I must tell you I should have no opinion of you, Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.
dickens|This was Mr Crunchers conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.
dickens|My Missis as I had the hard time wiStop though!
austen|Well, I could not have thought itand he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother!
dickens|said I.
dickens|Then, I think, said Mr Lorry, that I was very unhandsomely dealt with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my pattern.
austen|I knew, said he, that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.
dickens|In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.
dickens|By these conditions I promised to abide.
dickens|But she couldnt,at all events, she didnt.
austen|Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill opinion of Mrs Elton.
dickens|Mrs Pocket they held in contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily disappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon themselves.
austen|The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.
dickens|But, as an old fellow, who has carried Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have spoken.
dickens|There was some company in the room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, You are to go and stand there boy, till you are wanted.
austen|They had frequently been staying with her in town.
dickens|O yes, I dare say!
dickens|Ill tell you, Mum, said Mr Pumblechook.
austen|Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different.
austen|Mr Elton had retreated into the cardroom, looking Emma trusted very foolish.
dickens|If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.
dickens|It thrilled him with a great dread of discovery; but the man went on.
austen|But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it tomorrow.
austen|She speaks a little too quick.
dickens|It is a present to you on this day, in earnest of your expectations.
dickens|Wemmick leaned back in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in the pockets of his trousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post.
austen|She never stopt till she had gone through the whole; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong, yet he had been less wrong than she had supposedand he had suffered, and was very sorryand he was so grateful to Mrs Weston, and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself, that there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room, she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.
austen|Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more.
dickens|Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.
austen|He had, to be sure, done much.
dickens|Burn me, if I know!
austen|A most welcome negative followed the last questionand her alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.
austen|Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr Bingleys regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.
austen|Emma was gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character, and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance.
dickens|But the boldest point he made was this it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that she was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the murder, frantically destroyed her child by this mansome three years oldto revenge herself upon him.
dickens|The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size.
dickens|Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian, taking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her, was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and showing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.
dickens|Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.
dickens|I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers here, and in virtue of it I stand before you.
dickens|You are a disagreeable fellow.
dickens|It was the slightest start that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the sooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the action of taking out his pockethandkerchief.
dickens|And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.
austen|Mrs Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
austen|After this speech he was gone as soon as possible.
dickens|Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?
austen|She had provided a plentiful dinner for them; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it.
austen|I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish in your favour.
dickens|In her desire to be matrimonially established, you might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual contemplation of domestic bliss.
dickens|Is he dead?
austen|In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
dickens|He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me that he wanted comforting, for some reason or other.
austen|If Jane repressed her for a little time, she soon began again; and though much that passed between them was in a halfwhisper, especially on Mrs Eltons side, there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects The postofficecatching coldfetching lettersand friendship, were long under discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant to Janeinquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her, and professions of Mrs Eltons meditated activity.
dickens|For instance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.
austen|We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylors advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylors time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.
dickens|Do you promise?
dickens|as if he had never heard of ubiquitous Jacques in his time.
austen|She was afterwards looking for her shawlFrank Churchill was looking alsoit was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr Knightley could not tell.
dickens|I know it well, but do you know it?
austen|She had not time to know how Mr Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did another subject succeed; for Mr John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr Woodhouse  This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir.
dickens|Yes.
dickens|As a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favor us with his company, and he promptly accepted the invitation.
dickens|The responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger of melting his eyes.
austen|Very.
dickens|Up to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wished him gone.
austen|But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us?
austen|This gallant young man, who seemed to love without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it.
dickens|Now, as they went along, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Proviss safety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and went on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times, endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within.
austen|In ran Mrs Bennet to her daughters room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out  My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.
dickens|But they twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the questions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havishams, and what on earth I was expected to play at.
dickens|Monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights, with fascinating company.
dickens|Do I date it?
dickens|God knows it is a shame!
dickens|Drummle, an oldlooking young man of a heavy order of architecture, was whistling.
austen|It was as follows  MY DEAR SIR,  I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire.
dickens|All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise.
dickens|No; you have been the ward of Tellsons House since, and I have been busy with the other business of Tellsons House since.
dickens|It is for their safety.
dickens|Only one soul was to be seen, and that was Madame Defargewho leaned against the doorpost, knitting, and saw nothing.
austen|My courage rises while I write.
dickens|You know it to be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?
dickens|More than that; Im going to ask you to take a walk with me.
austen|They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.
dickens|Ah, poor thing!
austen|Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet.
austen|said she, as she looked in her face.
dickens|I dined with him yesterday.
dickens|It aint that I am proud, but that I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in these clothes.
austen|I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.
dickens|Mr Darnay presented himself while they were sitting under the planetree, but he was only One.
dickens|We had now got into the month of March.
austen|We have carriages to fetch and convey her home, and we live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the least inconvenient.
dickens|When I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of my wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five, the candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and the wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness.
dickens|Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.
austen|Every body knows what is due to you.
austen|But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr Darcys pleasure in the Bingleys invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.
dickens|I understand.
austen|One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emmaits being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchills stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr Westons confidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight.
dickens|He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which he had grown to be a part, like strong rootivy.
austen|Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?
austen|I shall just go round by Mrs Coles; but I shall not stop three minutes and, Jane, you had better go home directlyI would not have you out in a shower!
dickens|Joseph!
dickens|They always went on agen me about the Devil.
dickens|Well, I returned, glad for once to get the better of him in crossexamination, I do not know, for I have not made up my mind.
austen|I have not the smallest objection to explaining them, said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.
austen|He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his soninlaws protection, would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life.
dickens|There he goes again, you see!
dickens|cried the same scowling redcap.
dickens|I am afraid that must be admitted, said Herbert; and then I shall come back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I will walk quietly into the nearest church.
austen|Quite thick shoes.
austen|This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.
austen|It was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr Elton was proving himself, in many respects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him; proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little concerned about the feelings of others.
austen|You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such a situation together, said Jane, they are pretty sure to be equal; however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me.
austen|Her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness.
dickens|And them and their descendants, to the last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for.
dickens|he added, winking, as she disappeared.
dickens|Ah!
austen|It is well.
dickens|Nor have I.
dickens|But, in the funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the chair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and beautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.
austen|She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her fatherMr Weston and his son.
austen|Mr Elton must smile less, and Mr John Knightley more, to fit them for the place.
dickens|He is hanged there forty feet highand is left hanging, poisoning the water.
austen|The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a distance from.
dickens|Estella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joe took his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands; as if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a quarter of an ounce.
dickens|Say, shall I hire a carriage and posthorses?
austen|It is a retired place.
austen|He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.
dickens|Thats best of all.
austen|Elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.
dickens|But when Old Orlick come for to hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the legiron wot Old Orlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year ago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like a bullock, as he means to drop youhey?
dickens|Swine, pursued Mr Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his fork at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,swine were the companions of the prodigal.
dickens|Here is a chicken had round from the Boar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, heres one or two little things had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise.
dickens|Didnt you tell me that your guardian, Mr Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were not endowed with expectations only?
dickens|Come!
dickens|He married his second wife privately, because he was proud, and in course of time she died.
dickens|Ask my husband, is that so.
dickens|Is she dead, Joe?
austen|He is a most amiable, charming young man, I believe.
dickens|As a promising way of setting them right, half of the halfdozen had become members of a fantastic sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the spotthereby setting up a highly intelligible fingerpost to the Future, for Monseigneurs guidance.
dickens|There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing.
dickens|said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.
austen|Care of him!
austen|The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs Forster, the delight of Mrs Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described.
dickens|I resolved to go out to Richmond next day, and I went.
austen|She is not to be with the Dixons.
austen|What!
dickens|How did you come here?
dickens|Yes.
dickens|Gracious me, Flopson!
dickens|Herbert would also take a sheet of paper, and write across it with similar formalities, Memorandum of Herberts debts.
austen|Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment.
austen|Oh!
austen|So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.
austen|His belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.
dickens|Another night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home I always took him home, and always looked well about me, led us to the conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came back from Miss Havishams.
austen|We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.
austen|I have heard her speak of the acquaintance, said Emma; she is a very elegant young woman.
austen|cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.
austen|Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?
dickens|I thought he looked as if he did, said I.
austen|The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.
dickens|To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity, under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste, mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and suffering.
dickens|As he went out at the prisoners door, she turned, laid her head lovingly on her fathers breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his feet.
austen|I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.
dickens|Or do you kiss my hand in the same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?
austen|May was better for every thing than February.
dickens|Marquis, said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide, and his right hand raised, in the days when all these things are to be answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to answer for them.
dickens|When I looked back at Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the greatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of his toes.
dickens|said Mr Pocket, returning with a countenance expressive of grief and despair.
dickens|Only hear them!
austen|Mrs Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and illusage; blaming everybody but the person to whose illjudging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing.
dickens|But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr Jaggerss close room, until I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above Mr Jaggerss chair, and got up and went out.
dickens|Come, then!
austen|It was not lost on me.
dickens|I had not told him exactly when I meant to leave, and was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing.
dickens|You have just come down?
austen|Frank comes tomorrowI had a letter this morningwe see him tomorrow by dinnertime to a certaintyhe is at Oxford today, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be so.
dickens|I held tight to the leg of the table under the cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.
dickens|What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?
dickens|I half expected to see him drop down before my face and die of deadly cold.
dickens|While they despise your breath, and would stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath tells them.
austen|Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.
austen|After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.
austen|And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her!
dickens|Butits a flowing so soft and pleasant through the water, praps, as makes me think itI was a thinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river what I catches hold of.
dickens|That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he rubbed the arms of his chair, Its more than that, Mum.
austen|He thought we walked towards Randalls most days.
austen|However, he is coming, I assure you yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all.
austen|Yes, or I will never see her again.
dickens|There are large drops of rain falling, and they made me start.
austen|He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy.
austen|I certainly will come.
austen|As often as I can.
dickens|And his wish were, said Joe, getting the birdsnest under his left arm for the moment, and groping in it for an egg with his right; if no offence, as I would and you that.
dickens|Whats he got to do with the case?
dickens|Enough!
dickens|I do, said Drummle.
dickens|She was then just abreast of the rotted bridecake.
dickens|he said to himself.
austen|But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London.
austen|How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impedimentless acknowledged by Mr Weston than by herselfbut even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by sayingThose matters will take care of themselves; the young people will find a way.
austen|They are very, very kind in their visits.
dickens|There was no change whatever in Joe.
dickens|And dead?
austen|Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one.
dickens|The riders horse was blown, and both horse and rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man.
dickens|Allowing for my learned friends appearance being careless and slovenly if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise, not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought into comparison.
dickens|All covered with dust, white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!
austen|Yes, you see, you understand my feelingsand will return them if you can.
dickens|Praps its them that writes fifty hands, and thats not like sneaking you as writes but one.
dickens|said Miss Havisham to Camilla.
austen|He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage.
dickens|I should like to be, said I, glancing at the slate as he held it; with a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.
austen|And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.
dickens|Thankee, my boy.
dickens|retorted Mrs Pocket.
austen|Bingley urged Mr Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.
dickens|There is no one here to see.
dickens|An open door afforded a perspective view of the Aged in bed.
austen|Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas, she added in a melancholy tone, for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me.
dickens|Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences.
austen|Poor Mr Elton!
dickens|No.
austen|What is it?
dickens|Good Heaven, what was there to dismiss!
dickens|My young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.
dickens|Youve been at Doctor Manettes house as much as I have, or more than I have.
dickens|I have not leisure to think of that, said I.
austen|He readily agreed to it.
dickens|asked Biddy.
dickens|Hold!
austen|With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr Wickham and the officers, Mr Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.
dickens|Swallered em.
austen|He was received by Mrs Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.
dickens|She was tall and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her figure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in front, that was stuck full of pins and needles.
austen|He was not an illtempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased.
austen|Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.
dickens|Do you admire her?
dickens|Who let you in?
austen|Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.
dickens|Is that well?
dickens|and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the same fat five fingers.
austen|Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself.
austen|It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion, said Mr Knightley.
dickens|They came, and the shady house was sunny with a childs laugh, and the Divine friend of children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take her child in his arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred joy to her.
austen|She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion.
austen|I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W.
austen|This was too true for contradiction.
dickens|But dont lose your temper.
dickens|But now I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.
dickens|I took out my purse.
dickens|This was first put into my head by his seeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, What, Captain Tom?
austen|She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.
dickens|The late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it with him to the tomb, and to have brought it back.
austen|I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.
austen|his air as he walked by the housethe very sitting of his hat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!
austen|As the door opened she was heard,  So very obliging of you!
dickens|That you spoke of.
austen|But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January.
austen|My only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.
dickens|As the six evenings had dwindled away, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy.
austen|I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.
dickens|I am going to London, Miss Pocket, said I, and want to say goodbye to Miss Havisham.
dickens|That will be his place,there, striking the table with her stick, at my head!
austen|You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.
austen|It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country.
dickens|At such times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our emergence round some corner of expectancy, Here they come!
austen|His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!
dickens|When we were all out in the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I treasonably whispered to Joe, I hope, Joe, we shant find them.
austen|Can I do any thing for you?
dickens|Growling, in addition, such phrases as Ah!
dickens|O the many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within me haunted that house when Estella lived there!
austen|She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing this invitation, was Emmas conclusion.
austen|You will express yourself very properly, I am sure.
dickens|At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire; removed from them, a group of soldiers.
austen|The consciousness of having done amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have beenthat had beenhard for him to bear.
dickens|Sir, said the nephew, we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits of wrong.
austen|The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.
austen|Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte.
austen|I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love, said Darcy.
dickens|I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his look at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his neckerchief between his teethevidently forgottenmade my hand very difficult to master.
dickens|The key was put in the lock, and turned.
dickens|He answered, in a low voice, There is.
dickens|repeated Wemmick.
dickens|After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity.
dickens|said Mr Jaggers.
austen|I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.
dickens|They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay there a littlelistening perhaps.
dickens|There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all, Mr Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he detected all around him, walked from one to another.
dickens|I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.
austen|Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone.
dickens|He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him, and I now saw that he was inky.
austen|But Mrs Dixon must be very much disappointed.
austen|Ah!
dickens|Youre a game one, he returned, shaking his head at me with a deliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most exasperating; Im glad youve growd up, a game one!
austen|I shall, therefore, set off tomorrow.
austen|Very well, I thank you.
dickens|You will see.
austen|You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.
austen|The officers may not be so pleasant in General s regiment.
austen|She could not be complying, she dreaded being quarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence.
dickens|I was not praying against you; I was praying for you.
austen|My dear Charles, what do you mean?
dickens|You may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof.
austen|So much the better.
dickens|Tickler was a waxended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame.
dickens|Yes, dear old Pip, old chap.
dickens|He said it was not worth while, I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me, if I pleased.
dickens|In his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me that I turned my face aside to save it from the flame.
dickens|Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.
austen|As Harriet described it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour.
dickens|He handed it to his principal instead of to me.
austen|Mr Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately taking her hand said in reply  Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.
dickens|Then he added, raising his voice, I grieve to inform the societyin secret.
dickens|With what absurd emotions for we think the feelings that are very serious in a man quite comical in a boy I found myself again going to Miss Havishams, matters little here.
dickens|Barsad proposed to the rest, Let her embrace him then; it is but a moment.
austen|Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.
dickens|O, see!
dickens|One Hundred and Five, North Tower.
dickens|I am glad to hear it.
austen|I appeal to Mr Darcybut let me not interrupt you, sir.
dickens|So very great is the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration.
dickens|Yes, Miss Havisham.
dickens|Biddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,and the smell of a blackcurrant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening in the little garden by the side of the lane,said, Have you never considered that he may be proud?
austen|This was not submitted to by either lady.
austen|He was on one side of her mother.
austen|Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.
austen|Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of answering, she began speaking again to Mr John Knightley.
dickens|If it had been otherwise; Cartons hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; I never should have used the longer opportunity.
dickens|Pips rap, I heard her say, immediately; come in, Pip.
dickens|That I could have been at our old church in my old churchgoing clothes, on the very last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of impossibilities, geographical and social, solar and lunar.
dickens|Not more than other gentlemen do.
austen|You sad girl, how could you do such a thing?
dickens|I felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.
dickens|They will be rapid.
dickens|You young dog, said the man, licking his lips, what fat cheeks you ha got.
dickens|He held it between himself and the candle, tasted the port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his glass again, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and crossexamined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had known the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage.
austen|Then, observed Elizabeth, you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.
austen|I shall leave off while I am well.
dickens|Also, there were two doublebedded rooms,such as they were, the landlord said.
dickens|Dont take it that way, or youll get its head under the table.
austen|If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning.
dickens|It was Old London Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation.
dickens|Well put!
dickens|It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to live.
austen|He is a very liberal thanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.
austen|Money!
dickens|It was to you, said the spy, that his daughter came; and it was from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown monsieur; how is he called?
dickens|Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached to me, strongly attached to me.
austen|He shook his head.
dickens|I begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.
dickens|Jerry, said Mr Lorry.
dickens|Oh yes, youre eligible!
austen|She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.
dickens|Remember!
austen|she cried.
austen|do come in.
austen|He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.
dickens|It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley Drummles name upon it; or I would, very gladly.
dickens|It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the Temple Gardens leaning on Joes arm, that I saw this change in him very plainly.
austen|He will be able to tell her how we all are.
austen|I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up.
dickens|Then to make an end of it, said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to my sister; its fiveandtwenty pound.
austen|Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs Elton is going; dear Mrs Elton, how elegant she looks!
dickens|Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling, stared at him.
dickens|I want, said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker, to let in a little more light here.
dickens|I hope you care to live?
austen|But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriets habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short, they would both be soon after her.
austen|She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him.
dickens|Tried to murder him?
dickens|O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was, and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history.
dickens|Mr Pip, he returned, you will be welcome there, in a private and personal capacity.
dickens|And now, said the suppressed voice with another oath, call out again, and Ill make short work of you!
dickens|Hes as thin as a lath.
austen|I assure you I am not at all pleased.
austen|That reply will do for the present.
austen|Already arisen?
dickens|Would you mind Handel for a familiar name?
austen|He did not think we ever walked this road.
austen|Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.
dickens|It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring atwriting some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at once by a sort of stratagemand seeing Biddy observant of what I was about.
austen|My dear Harriet, what do you mean?
dickens|I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or so like some extraordinary bird; standing as he did speechless, with his tuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm.
austen|I never had much opinion of the sea air.
austen|And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.
austen|and then follows the application, which I think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending.
dickens|I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my lips.
austen|Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!
austen|Though Mr Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage.
austen|I cannot understand it.
dickens|I was not related to the outlaw, or connected with him by any recognizable tie; he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his apprehension, and to do so now would be idle.
dickens|The window indicated was the office window.
dickens|said I.
dickens|This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr Lorrys friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him.
dickens|That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed.
austen|Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?
austen|A letter arrived from Mr Churchill to urge his nephews instant return.
dickens|Here and there in the long street of St.
austen|The evil of the distance from Enscombe, said Mr Weston, is, that Mrs Churchill, as we understand, has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together.
dickens|Well, sir, returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the shoulder, this is a matter that youll soon arrange, I dare say, but youre arrested.
dickens|was Mr Lorrys breathless reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.
dickens|Now, whether, pursued Herbert, he had used the childs mother ill, or whether he had used the childs mother well, Provis doesnt say; but she had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described to us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity for her, and forbearance towards her.
austen|This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.
dickens|It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of industry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry, that I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain.
dickens|I see youd been a reading of em when I come in.
dickens|The responsibility of giving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the clergymans being unintentionally scandalized, and it happened thus.
austen|We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all.
austen|Such was Miss Lucass scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.
dickens|It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much the forlorner for being delayed till dark.
austen|I only wish my eyes may last me as well.
austen|He did look at it, and into it for halfanhourwas pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.
dickens|That, he Mr AttorneyGeneral was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that, in a general way, he preferred him to his Mr AttorneyGenerals brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his Mr AttorneyGenerals father and mother.
austen|The Woodhouses were first in consequence there.
dickens|Alone!
austen|Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.
dickens|Oh!
austen|But what is that to me?
dickens|Does he like the trade?
austen|Did you speak to me?
dickens|What do I know!
dickens|Pass this way, then.
dickens|Little, if any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but the understanding was established that they were necessary to her, and that she was necessary to them.
dickens|It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church Wemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it, and put the cover on again.
dickens|Madame Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.
dickens|Why do you write in the public streets?
austen|Some time or other he will bebut it shall not be by me.
dickens|I dont wish it professionally spoken about.
dickens|And the dear old homevoice answered, Which it air, old chap.
austen|You know not what you are about.
austen|asked Mr Knightley.
austen|Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.
austen|After I had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill behind!
dickens|Joe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to listen for the chaisecart.
austen|Indeed I am.
austen|She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.
dickens|Do you want me then, said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and serious, if not angry, look, to deceive and entrap you?
dickens|Nor written?
austen|where did you hear it?
austen|He has not an illnatured look.
austen|My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.
austen|Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier;it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfaxs situation with Mr Knightley.
dickens|Heres her allowance of bread, and heres her slice of cheese, and heres her rum,which I drink.
dickens|The sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black darkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.
dickens|said he.
austen|Of his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.
dickens|A clerk.
dickens|said I.
austen|why is not everybody as happy?
austen|This is three times as large.
austen|Oh!
austen|I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours, turning to Emma, a lady residing in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax.
dickens|said he.
dickens|Once, returned Joe.
austen|If I had followed her judgment, and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.
dickens|Mind that!
dickens|Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde, was the stolid reply.
dickens|It was understood that nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject more psychological than Gout, Rum, and Pursers stores.
dickens|He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added, in a hurry, Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers.
dickens|They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing.
dickens|Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her eyes, and broke like waves.
austen|She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued  You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it.
dickens|Yes, said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.
dickens|Mithter Jaggerth!
dickens|A revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected, which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.
austen|She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.
dickens|Are you?
austen|The coming of her sisters family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expectedshe did not herself expectthat any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers.
dickens|Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful manner at the sight of his accumulating figures.
dickens|The real Bankinghouse by Temple Bar, the real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there.
dickens|She aint in that line, Mum, said Mr Pumblechook.
austen|My Emma!
austen|This is a pleasure, said he, in rather a low voice, coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated.
austen|He might observe that it was so.
dickens|LOT 1 was marked in whitewashed knockknee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part of the main building which had been so long shut up.
dickens|He was full of plans for his gentlemans coming out strong, and like a gentleman, and urged me to begin speedily upon the pocketbook which he had left in my possession.
dickens|But I delivered this written communication slate and all with my own hand, and Joe received it as a miracle of erudition.
austen|The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty.
austen|He was looking about, he was going to the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.
austen|Emma would be very happy to wait on Mrs Bates, &c.
dickens|And Mr Jaggers is made your guardian?
dickens|Handel, myHalloa!
austen|It was over at last, however.
austen|Would not Harriet be the very creature described?
dickens|The other had that likeness tooas you havebut was not the same.
dickens|Therefore, he resolved to keep Two before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.
austen|I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force.
dickens|This is a banknote, said I, for five hundred pounds.
dickens|He raised them, and saw her face.
dickens|said Carton, turning to him.
austen|How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates?
austen|Mr Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.
dickens|Ah!
austen|She is always so attentive to them!
dickens|Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!
austen|Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.
dickens|Of course there was a publichouse in the village, and of course Joe liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there.
dickens|Ha, ha!
dickens|The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had done.
dickens|I released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition.
dickens|The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a little spelling,that is to say, it had had once.
dickens|Him and his hooroars!
austen|For my temptation to think it a right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below, and casements above, in Highbury.
austen|She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs Weston had not a lively concern; and half an hours uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.
austen|She would rather not be in his company more than she could help.
dickens|That fountain suggested the Paris fountain, the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the tall man with his arms up, crying, Dead!
austen|That fellow, said he, indignantly, thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice.
dickens|Since it dont interfere with business, returned Wemmick, let it be so.
austen|But still he went on measuring, and still he ended with,  I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.
austen|said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement.
dickens|But, I would not take it away while he was present.
dickens|But there was some one there?
austen|Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs Goddards experience and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist than not, she added soon afterwardsas if quite another subject,  It is so cold, so very coldand looks and feels so very much like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I should really try not to go out todayand dissuade my father from venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr and Mrs Weston.
austen|There is a gentleman with him, mamma, said Kitty; who can it be?
austen|Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent togetherand four evenings may do a great deal.
austen|Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject.
austen|My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain, and that you yourself  Oh!
austen|It was by no means his daughters wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition.
dickens|The last supplication but one I make to you, is, that you will believe this of me.
dickens|Then, he softly called, Enter there!
dickens|The Marquis took from his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his foot.
austen|I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else.
dickens|We are all attention, Aged One.
dickens|I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected; there was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very near being so.
dickens|said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the waterdrops; its nothing, Pip.
dickens|And now, said Mr Stryver, shaking his forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, my way out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.
austen|He seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to her.
austen|On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sittingroom, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.
dickens|The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square.
dickens|This is not for you to inquire into.
dickens|Its new to me, but you are right, I dare say.
austen|But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your fathers house.
austen|Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.
dickens|What a disordered state you are in!
austen|I would rather not be tempted.
austen|I think seriously of Miss Smith!
dickens|This is not your proper occupation.
dickens|I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drew his sleeve across his eyes and forehead.
dickens|Assuming for a moment, that he was overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder?
austen|She hoped it was not so.
dickens|From Miss Pross.
austen|He has been wanting to come to us, continued Mr Weston, ever since September every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his own time.
austen|Do not distress her.
dickens|Remember what he is going to assist us in, said Herbert, and be calm.
dickens|I dont like to leave you here, I said to Provis, though I cannot doubt your being safer here than near me.
dickens|After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, Good!
austen|Mrs Elton then said, Nobody can think less of dress in general than I dobut upon such an occasion as this, when every bodys eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westonswho I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honourI would not wish to be inferior to others.
austen|You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came.
dickens|I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was aeating my dinner or my supper, and I says, Heres the boy again, a looking at me whiles I eats and drinks!
dickens|That is what he meant when he said your life was not your own.
dickens|It is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?
austen|Mr Weston was musing.
dickens|They continued to be uttered in their regular succession, with the cry, My husband, my father, and my brother!
austen|You like Mr Elton, papa,I must look about for a wife for him.
austen|When my eyes were opened to his real characterOh!
austen|Let me know it all.
dickens|I have had a pattern in my hand.
dickens|Sir, I thank you indeed.
dickens|And when I said yes for indeed she did, would seem to enjoy it greedily.
dickens|The distance is ten miles.
dickens|Hes a wonderful man, without his living likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine with him,and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.
dickens|But my dear!
austen|The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was modern and wellbuilt.
dickens|But I dont mind them.
dickens|I am going to be married to him.
dickens|While going along, the strange gentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of his finger.
austen|You are silent, he cried, with great animation; absolutely silent!
austen|Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her fathers incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.
dickens|My Lord perhaps with George Washington on his mind showed some surprise that they were not agreed, but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward, and retired himself.
austen|In the present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,  These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good.
dickens|Never too soon, sir, said Joe, and never too often, Pip!
austen|But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.
dickens|At midday, the roll of drums.
dickens|Have you thought of your future?
austen|One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in upon ones friends before the lookout begins, is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs.
dickens|If Miss Havisham wished to see me, returned Mr Pumblechook, discomfited.
austen|The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.
austen|In order to assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.
dickens|It is a part of Miss Havishams plans for me, Pip, said Estella, with a sigh, as if she were tired; I am to write to her constantly and see her regularly and report how I go on,I and the jewels,for they are nearly all mine now.
dickens|Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed, held by Defarges arm as he held by the turnkeys.
austen|I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man.
austen|Indifferent!
dickens|Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked with a steady head confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his end, never doubting that he would save Lucies husband at last.
austen|Oh, no, nothis is not likely.
dickens|No!
austen|The difference of Harriet at Mrs Goddards, or in London, made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emmas sensations; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.
dickens|T.
austen|Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.
austen|you are not serious now.
dickens|Or even, said he, if you was helped to knocking her up a new chain for the front door,or say a gross or two of sharkheaded screws for general use,or some light fancy article, such as a toastingfork when she took her muffins,or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such like  I dont mean any present at all, Joe, I interposed.
austen|She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer.
austen|But I must tell you how it went off.
austen|It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr Weston had foreseen, before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchills feelings.
dickens|He might think my brain was softening, or something of the kind.
dickens|Good night, citizen.
dickens|For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said to orangetrees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid over the counter?
dickens|But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different wayhave affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its foundations couldI have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress.
austen|Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.
austen|If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!
dickens|Mr Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion of him.
dickens|The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and emptied my pockets.
dickens|If she had been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had been ordered to the axe tomorrow, would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent her there.
dickens|The dark deference of fear and slavery, my friend, observed the Marquis, will keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof, looking up to it, shuts out the sky.
austen|at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?
dickens|She has since been taught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she was tamed from the beginning.
austen|To complete every other recommendation, he had almost told her that he loved her.
dickens|You are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you cant help showing it.
dickens|When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help noticing, even then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters clothes, than in the steaks.
dickens|The pen dropped from Darnays fingers on the table, and he looked about him vacantly.
dickens|Your health.
austen|Now they seemed in pleasant conversation.
dickens|I was still thinking of it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him waiting for me near the door.
austen|No, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement I received  Encouragement!
dickens|Not five or six?
austen|Without scruplewithout apologywithout much apparent diffidence, Mr Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself her lover.
dickens|said I.
austen|His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.
dickens|And yet I think And there he shook his head, and stopped.
austen|Mr Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command, as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she listened, and smiled, and congratulated.
austen|How do you all do?
austen|I saw her as I came in; she was standing in the entrance.
austen|But nothing can be doneI know very well that nothing can be done.
austen|Mrs Westons friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the satisfaction of her welldoing could be increased to Emma, it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl.
austen|We shall not be many, you know.
austen|I wonder who the friend wasand who could be the young lady.
austen|I told you he was plain.
austen|Her fathers comfort was amply secured, Mrs Bates as well as Mrs Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she left the house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever unwilling selfdenial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal.
austen|Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a moments debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,  Never marry!
dickens|Some of his Kings Bench familiars, who were occasionally parties to the fullbodied wine and the lie, excused him for the latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed it himselfwhich is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence, as to justify any such offenders being carried off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.
austen|When I have seen Mr Elton, replied Jane, I dare say I shall be interestedbut I believe it requires that with me.
dickens|Give me Number Four, you!
austen|It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.
dickens|Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence?
dickens|Here and there, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little creek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them nervously.
dickens|Try, and not do it?
dickens|With money down?
dickens|Hes a gentleman, if you please, this villain.
dickens|The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward.
dickens|We went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we should continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss Havisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on my shoulder; and said with some displeasure,  You are growing tall, Pip!
dickens|Im wrong out of the forge, the kitchen, or off th meshes.
dickens|She will be mourning and grieving.
dickens|We sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, After so many years, it is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our first meeting was!
dickens|Throughout dinner he took a dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often referring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again, he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he extortedand even did extort, though I dont know howthose references out of my innocent self.
austen|He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc.
dickens|returned madame.
austen|Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?
dickens|It is not easy for even you.
dickens|The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance, whom her eyes first encountered, Well, I am sure, Boldface!
dickens|All the children of the village, and most of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two warders the postboy knocked at the door,implying that I was far too much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.
austen|She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!
austen|When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were almost hopeless.
austen|This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.
dickens|Putting on the best clothes I had, I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open, and presented myself before Mr Trabb, the tailor, who was having his breakfast in the parlor behind his shop, and who did not think it worth his while to come out to me, but called me into him.
dickens|Well!
dickens|I care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.
austen|And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.
dickens|Much interested and agitated, Mr Lorry said You come from Doctor Manette?
dickens|It aint a long walk, and its an early one.
dickens|Why stop?
dickens|I stopped, and he came up breathless.
dickens|What do you say?
dickens|I shall see him tomorrow, you remember, and I had better not take it into the prison.
austen|She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.
austen|Her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering; and by the ten days end, her nephews letter to Randalls communicated a change of plan.
austen|She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.
austen|It is certainly very well regulated.
dickens|Nobody was hard with him or with me.
dickens|Such whims are only impressive as we originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated.
dickens|Well!
austen|Have not you mistaken the day?
austen|Dear, dear Lizzy.
austen|The danger would have been of my wearying you.
dickens|He had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little to do for him.
dickens|He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on one side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw that my bread and butter was gone.
dickens|Dont let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me.
austen|It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.
dickens|Naturally, said Mr Lorry.
dickens|What money would be drawn out of Tellsons henceforth, and what would lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in Tellsons hidingplaces, while the depositors rusted in prisons, and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with Tellsons never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr Jarvis Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions.
dickens|Sarah Pocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah was too knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence.
dickens|It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand millweirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was taken on board the galley.
austen|Oh!
dickens|There are reasons why I must say no more of that.
dickens|Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his threecornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellsons, Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose.
dickens|I asked indignantly.
dickens|I think she is very proud, I replied, in a whisper.
dickens|Everything was bowed down, dejected, oppressed, and broken.
austen|My dear Jane, are you sure you did not wet your feet?
austen|With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kittys hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.
dickens|You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses today.
dickens|Some real or fancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the marsh, now gave him a start, and he said, suddenly,  Youre not a deceiving imp?
austen|Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.
dickens|I wish, said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, that I had em here.
austen|Her report was highly favourable.
dickens|Come?
dickens|But, his longcherished desire to know more about these matters, not only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again.
dickens|Yet a gentleman may not keep a publichouse; may he?
dickens|No, I couldnt indeed, said Biddy.
austen|It will be felt so great an attention!
dickens|If ever anybodys hair stood on end with terror, mine must have done so then.
austen|Being my friends, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye, but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.
austen|He did speak yesterdaythat is, he wrote, and was refused.
dickens|But no matter; dont stay to look; put it up carefully with mine and your own.
austen|Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.
dickens|He, therefore, made haste to say  It is of the utmost importance to me you know, Citizen, even better than I, of how much importance, that I should be able to communicate to Mr Lorry of Tellsons Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris, the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the prison of La Force.
dickens|hi!
austen|Can the old lady?
dickens|They were her husbands words, as he held her to his bosom.
dickens|Theres a subject!
dickens|Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his large hands, and put the other in his trouserspocket as if the pocket were full of secrets.
austen|yesshe will have her own room, of course; the room she always has;and there is the nursery for the children,just as usual, you know.
dickens|Mr Cruncher made the observation to his next neighbour, and added, Id hold half a guinea that he dont get no lawwork to do.
austen|And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.
dickens|Certainly he should not.
austen|So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.
austen|This was not very consoling to Mrs Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before.
austen|You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.
dickens|Which?
dickens|The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of the lamps usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance on the fog.
dickens|My dear sir, said Mr Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened his arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each elbow, dont hurt me by mentioning that.
austen|We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before.
austen|he could ride to London at any time.
austen|I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself but your good friend there nodding towards the upper end of the table has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their effects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.
dickens|Thrown out of his honourable employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing therenot because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern datehe knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in France first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives.
dickens|No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite undeserving.
austen|I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.
dickens|The soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four torches, and took one himself and distributed the others.
dickens|Yes.
dickens|Monseigneur, hear my petition!
austen|And now heres Mr Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?
dickens|Armed men and women flocked out of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in Saint Antoines bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children.
dickens|Mrs Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the house ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dustpan,an article into which his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.
dickens|My daughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life.
dickens|And yet there is not in France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf, a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror.
austen|But with a reproachful smile at Emma she receives attentions from Mrs Elton, which nobody else pays her.
dickens|I could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing.
austen|Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account.
austen|The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion.
austen|I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at.
austen|Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people?
austen|When once it had been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim.
dickens|O dear no, sir, said Mr Wopsle, not drunk.
austen|s, I had a great curiosity.
austen|She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any of mamas children ever were.
austen|That he should have been in love with her for so many months!
dickens|Looked?
austen|Mr Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,  Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty kind of young person.
dickens|Stay!
austen|Yesbut as it happens, they are all of them very clever.
austen|But that it will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise.
dickens|Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.
austen|As to her illness, all nothing of course.
dickens|First knowed Mr Jaggers that way.
austen|Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst.
austen|That is a great thing.
austen|Mr Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.
dickens|Mr Crunchers attention was here diverted to the doorkeeper, whom he saw making his way to Mr Lorry, with the note in his hand.
dickens|And while I was occupied with these deliberations, I would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us, and my heart would beat high.
dickens|Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.
austen|He was wishing to confide in herperhaps to consult her;cost her what it would, she would listen.
austen|is Miss Fairfax going?
austen|Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was dueor rather what would be kind by me.
austen|I knew it wasbut had not resolution enough to part with them.
dickens|Him, Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out.
austen|Do you know Mr Bingley?
austen|Pray come in; do come in.
austen|From Harriets manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom, she had strong hopes.
dickens|In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.
austen|Mr Weston directed the whole, officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good time.
austen|cried Mr John Knightley, hearing his own name.
austen|And what arts did he use to separate them?
dickens|I had to put my hand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to stir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.
austen|He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.
austen|It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained, as to any such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy.
austen|Yes, Mr Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a very strong proof.
austen|Real, longstanding regard brought the Westons and Mr Knightley; and by Mr Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr Woodhouses drawingroom, and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.
austen|But Elizabeth was not formed for illhumour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.
dickens|You must know that, although I have used the term expectations more than once, you are not endowed with expectations only.
dickens|Nobody thought of me.
austen|She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.
austen|You are so strange!
austen|I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.
dickens|I thought he had been drinking, but he was not drunk.
austen|There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve.
austen|Elizabeths mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.
austen|As for his going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be too late, and the party too numerous.
dickens|Drat that boy, interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work, what a questioner he is.
dickens|There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and guilty manner, Mr Lorry hacked the shoemakers bench to pieces, while Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murderfor which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure.
austen|How I long to see her again!
austen|His importance at Enscombe was very evident.
dickens|When we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window and had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it came down like the guillotine.
dickens|I pledge you, but I deny the beauty.
dickens|Ah, young master, theres more changes than yours.
dickens|A deficient, illtempered, lowering, stupid fellow.
austen|In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one.
dickens|Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, sir?
austen|Nay, cried Bingley, this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.
dickens|They were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite.
dickens|The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to have a cup of tea.
dickens|As we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together.
dickens|cried Miss Pross, to give me such a greeting, and show me no affection.
dickens|Monseigneur, it is nothing.
dickens|Now, Mr Pip, I have done with stipulations.
austen|It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!
austen|How is Miss Fairfax?
austen|Ah!
austen|Till this moment I never knew myself.
austen|You are too hasty, sir, she cried.
dickens|I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.
austen|Pray make my excuses and adieus to her.
dickens|I believe you they dread him.
austen|And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one.
dickens|So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning.
austen|I went for only one night, and could not get away till that very day sennight.
dickens|he returned, Ill let you go.
dickens|But there is another question, said Herbert.
dickens|Well, I dont know all I mean, for I cant call to mind what your name was, over the water.
dickens|There was the red sun, on the low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into black; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were the rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life, save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.
dickens|Am I to come again, Miss Havisham?
austen|Good Heaven!
dickens|But since my duty has not been incompatible with the admission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart.
austen|After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than Harriets returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had understanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance.
dickens|There were printed bills on the gate and on bits of carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of the Household Furniture and Effects, next week.
austen|How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield!
dickens|Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag him back!
austen|When we first began to talk of her.
dickens|But, Joe.
dickens|Surname Pip?
austen|When his letter to Mrs Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had undervalued their strength.
austen|Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.
dickens|A man would die tonight of lying out on the marshes, I thought.
austen|But enough of this.
austen|She answered him in the usual way, and after a moments pause, added  My eldest sister has been in town these three months.
austen|Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moments deliberation  I am not.
austen|Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of Mr Elton.
dickens|It was bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand and arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like a cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck.
austen|Is not she?
dickens|He smiled, and I understood his touch to mean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast.
austen|Well, he is a very undeserving young manand I do not suppose theres the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now.
austen|My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.
austen|The dejection was almost universal.
dickens|I heard it.
dickens|For I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it had so bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning.
dickens|You approve?
dickens|I looked again, and though she was still looking at me, the suggestion was gone.
dickens|Pray make the best use of your time.
austen|One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry.
dickens|My appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders, favored my object.
dickens|Only his game.
austen|and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas.
austen|Mrs Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could.
dickens|As she applied herself to set the teathings, Joe peeped down at me over his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and calculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the grievous circumstances foreshadowed.
austen|She had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly.
austen|takes M.
dickens|Let us never be blind, said Mr Pumblechook, to her faults of temper, but it is to be hoped she meant well.
dickens|Its just gone half past two.
dickens|It is not a fortunate discovery, and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune, anything.
dickens|Dear, dear, dear!
dickens|Didnt I tell you, said the other convict then, that he would murder me, if he could?
austen|Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!
austen|You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have been very bad, but for Perrys great attention.
austen|And how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter?
dickens|Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for Tomcats.
dickens|Thats the sentence.
dickens|A puppy?
austen|I hope, with all my heart, the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.
dickens|He only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.
austen|Invite them both.
austen|The truth of this representation there was no denying.
austen|But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;only consider how great it would have been.
austen|They repulsed every attempt of Mrs Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr Collins, who was complimenting Mr Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.
austen|I shall be back by dinner.
austen|I have no faith in Mrs Eltons acknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of goodbreeding.
austen|dear; I was so miserable!
dickens|What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip?
dickens|And Wemmick said, I do.
austen|Donwell!
austen|Mr Frank Churchill did not come.
dickens|Look here, you sir.
dickens|Let her call me mad, let her call me mad!
austen|And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?
dickens|The prisoner counted the measurement again, and paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition.
austen|But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.
austen|That he should even speak to her was amazing!
dickens|Come, Pip, said Joe, persuasively, if there warnt no wealcutlets, at least there was dogs?
austen|Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.
austen|such delightful proofs of Hartfields attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over.
austen|I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.
dickens|When we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured, and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechooks.
dickens|Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as well as if I wrote.
dickens|I still held on to the leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude.
austen|I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh.
dickens|As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.
austen|I am sure she does.
austen|Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousins praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation.
dickens|Death has done that!
dickens|This, in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way.
austen|Their table was superlatively stupid.
dickens|Mr Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, and he had written after it on his card, just out of Smithfield, and close by the coachoffice.
dickens|added the clerk again, with another stir.
dickens|Here, in Paris?
dickens|But he did not conceal from me that, although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this case to make it one of them.
dickens|If it is Defarge began, and stopped.
dickens|A Doctor with a daughter.
dickens|When he fell asleep of an evening, with his knotted hands clenching the sides of the easychair, and his bald head tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sit and look at him, wondering what he had done, and loading him with all the crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to start up and fly from him.
dickens|I heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde.
dickens|Remember!
austen|Here was a dangerous opening.
dickens|Its not the question, my dear child, who paid for them, returned Camilla.
dickens|Yet, work of that kind was being done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wineshop stood looking at him, a whitehaired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.
dickens|When my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the stiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit.
dickens|Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.
austen|Catherine, weakspirited, irritable, and completely under Lydias guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, selfwilled and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.
austen|You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other.
dickens|And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon it, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely married that day.
dickens|To whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued, he said Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for tomorrow?
austen|By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.
dickens|What are you up to?
austen|I am trying to make it out.
dickens|Shall I take her to a coach?
dickens|Above all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had been accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me every now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, Such a fine figure of a woman as she once were, Pip!
austen|The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart.
austen|I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were notfor a few weeks at least.
austen|Peculiarly lucky!
austen|It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucass.
austen|It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way.
dickens|Please!
austen|It is not likely that I should, considering what I have been used to.
dickens|I hurried then to the breakfasttable, and on it found a letter.
dickens|We all three went into the street together, and from the doorstep Wemmick turned his way, and Mr Jaggers and I turned ours.
dickens|For this reason, I resolved to alight as soon as we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing.
dickens|I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner party.
dickens|No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all.
austen|And this is your real opinion!
dickens|That young man has a secret way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his heart, and at his liver.
dickens|Here is a visitor.
austen|Mr John Knightley smiled, and replied,  That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before.
dickens|She set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was habitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of forcing herself to attend.
dickens|said Mr Trabb, in a hailfellowwellmet kind of way.
austen|Her fancy was very active.
dickens|No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.
austen|It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion.
dickens|And Biddy, her word were, Go to him, without loss of time.
austen|Emmas spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore a different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before.
austen|As a friend!
dickens|Shall if I like, growled Orlick.
dickens|It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and return to the hotel at night, and to London tomorrow.
dickens|When he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister.
dickens|You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do something useful and good.
dickens|Still, Mrs Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity, because she had not married a title; while Mr Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving reproach, because he had never got one.
austen|But ah!
dickens|I answered.
austen|Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he looked back, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago.
dickens|At twothirds of a league from the BarrierI did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards when I traversed itit struck out of the main avenue, and presently stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed, to the door of the house.
dickens|The success is not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.
dickens|They did not creep far, before they stopped and stood upright.
dickens|I know, said I, in answer to that action,I know.
austen|But is it certainabsolutely certain?
austen|I must think your statement by no means fair.
dickens|Hooray, father!
dickens|They are sought by so many, and they are granted comparatively to so few!
dickens|For the first time he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughters husband, and deliver him.
austen|But upon my honour, I do not.
austen|By that time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting awayand thenonly think!
austen|Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!
dickens|I shuddered at the thought that for anything I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.
austen|It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear and the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the recovery of her health, than on any thing else.
dickens|But, to any mind, I thought, the connection here was clear and straight.
austen|The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.
austen|was her immediate exclamation.
austen|his own mind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it in others.
dickens|There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to feel my deficiencies.
dickens|He received that piece of information with a yell of laughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little distance.
austen|My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you cant think.
dickens|No silver, sir.
dickens|There are two other points, said Mr Lorry, on which I am anxious to be instructed.
austen|It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.
dickens|At about six oclock of the morning, therefore, I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine, just as they said, not stopping for being touched, Take the pencil and write under my name, I forgive her.
austen|We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.
dickens|The top of mine to the foot of yours,the foot of yours to the top of mine,Ring once, ring twice,the best tune on the Musical Glasses!
dickens|For some days, I even kept close at home, and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going on an errand, lest the officers of the County Jail should pounce upon me.
dickens|He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed which is invariably the case, all the world over, when Mr Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder, hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question  I say!
dickens|Herbert said he thought it would be kind to do so; therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnards with us, wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat until two oclock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing his plans.
austen|But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma.
dickens|All curious to see, thought Mr Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, but all natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldnt be in better hands.
dickens|I have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him.
austen|Soon afterwards he began again,  How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion, Miss Fairfax.
dickens|Then I asked if there were many clerks?
austen|My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.
dickens|When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the walnutshell countenance, I felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with everything; and that was all I took by that motion.
dickens|I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man.
dickens|Youll hear one presently.
dickens|Wemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with him, and wished him joy.
austen|how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!
dickens|Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been worn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an elegant lady whom I had never seen.
austen|That young man speaking lower is very thoughtless.
austen|Goodbye, goodbye.
dickens|said Estella with disdain, before our first game was out.
austen|I thought it very well done of him indeed.
austen|The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room.
dickens|And as Madame Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with, and left behind.
dickens|And she looked up from her book, and said, Yes.
austen|Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance.
dickens|And off its head comes.
dickens|Hush!
austen|do not tell me.
dickens|A citizeness of France?
dickens|I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful acquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man.
austen|He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed.
dickens|And I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!
dickens|There is nothing to apprehend.
austen|I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those little nervous headaches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of coming.
austen|Mrs Weston told me you were here.
austen|She touchedshe admittedshe acknowledged the whole truth.
dickens|When I was younger, I had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.
dickens|Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew where I was to be found.
austen|The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.
dickens|You say I am lucky.
austen|She was sensible of all the affection it evinced.
dickens|I had liked it once, but once was not now.
austen|It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.
dickens|It was an oldfashioned place, moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness, proud of its incommodiousness.
dickens|My burning arm throbbed, and my burning head throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander.
dickens|In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual harmless ways of life were changed.
austen|Absurd and insufferable!
austen|Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for welleducated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.
dickens|On the three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth day he went away to join Lucie and her husband.
dickens|A solitary old bachelor, answered Mr Lorry, shaking his head.
austen|They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.
austen|I want you to call me something else, but I do not know what.
dickens|You are a luckier, if you mean that.
dickens|And so do I, I added, with a scarlet face.
austen|Occupied in observing Mr Bingleys attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.
austen|Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.
austen|I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all pleased with.
dickens|It is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace himselfas I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner.
austen|I do remember it, cried Emma; I perfectly remember it.
dickens|Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night, ask that question?
dickens|the crying woman pleaded.
austen|How so?
dickens|He was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious manner,more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent hurry, than a man who was eating it,but he left off to take some of the liquor.
dickens|The two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether they didnt smell fire at the present moment.
austen|Teasing, teasing, man!
dickens|This done, he went on direct to Defarges, and went in.
dickens|Heaven be with you!
dickens|Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be comfortableor anything but miserablethere, Biddy!
austen|It was but an effusion of lively spirits.
austen|Mr Woodhouse must not, under the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.
austen|I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.
austen|It was accepted; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbells family, and had lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother from time to time.
austen|I see it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown.
austen|Is nothing due to me on that score?
dickens|The cattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes, and steaming out of their nostrils, Halloa, young thief!
austen|Oh!
austen|Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said  Mr Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours.
dickens|She only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.
austen|This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest.
dickens|She will be full of sympathy with its enemies.
dickens|I saw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open; there, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.
dickens|When he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that I waved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited; sometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving about to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round.
dickens|It is a great pity, croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head, with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; it is not quite like a good citizen; it is a thing to regret.
austen|If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.
dickens|For, it must be recorded, that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but, Mr Cruncherthough it seemed on his own separate and individual accountwas in a state of the greatest wonder.
dickens|said I.
dickens|Is it to be built on?
austen|Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.
austen|A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk.
dickens|At length I got out, Joe, have you told Biddy?
dickens|Yes, dearest Charles, with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him; we are rather thoughtful tonight, for we have something on our mind tonight.
dickens|All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them.
austen|She shared in their attendance on Mrs Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom.
austen|I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration.
austen|I do not know who is good enough for him.
dickens|Why, you dont mean to say began my sister.
dickens|Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No job in his absence.
austen|He and Mrs Weston were both dreadfully desponding.
dickens|Pint out the place!
austen|The strength of the song falls on the second.
dickens|Hah!
dickens|Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too strong for us, Colonel.
dickens|I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, highshouldered, stooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legs extraordinarily wide apart so that in my short days I always saw some miles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane.
austen|I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.
austen|One would fancy we were bosom friends!
austen|Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals, shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had been prepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and the kindness had perfectly answered.
austen|Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other!
dickens|Accordingly, I started at once, and she leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have been an imitation founded on my first impulse under that roof of Mr Pumblechooks chaisecart.
dickens|I am confident that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the revival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood.
austen|Or Miss Bates?
dickens|I thought how one link of association had helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link, wanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a chance swift from Estellas name to the fingers with their knitting action, and the attentive eyes.
austen|We admired it so much, that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smiths collection.
austen|Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs Weston was in distress about the supper; and Mr Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score of health.
austen|In that case, nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.
dickens|Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait, Mr Lorry dropped off to sleep.
austen|I dare say Mr Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.
dickens|Him, man, with whom I have exchanged.
dickens|Such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies among the assembled devotees of Monseigneurforming a goodly half of the polite companywould have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and appearance, owned to being a Mother.
austen|There is something very pompous in his style.
austen|The interest he takes in herhis anxiety about her healthhis concern that she should have no happier prospect!
austen|Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!
austen|thought Emmabut what has all that to do with taking likenesses?
dickens|I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe, I said.
austen|yesdid not you know?
dickens|Thats true, said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always chilled me.
austen|And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already.
dickens|Yet in the London streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening, there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of night, the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnards Inn, under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my heart.
austen|No, let them be ever so happy together, it will not give me another moments pang and to convince you that I have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroywhat I ought to have destroyed long agowhat I ought never to have keptI know that very well blushing as she spoke.
austen|Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.
austen|Ambition, as well as love, had probably been mortified.
dickens|Whos this man?
austen|...  The old lady!
austen|Has your son been with you, then?
austen|He was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Janes letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain.
austen|You saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely enough to live on.
austen|Little Emma, grow up a better woman than your aunt.
dickens|After another moments listening, Joe who was a good judge agreed, and Mr Wopsle who was a bad judge agreed.
austen|It is a most uncommon complexion, with her dark eyelashes and haira most distinguishing complexion!
austen|Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home.
austen|Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.
dickens|If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy, said I, in a virtuous and superior tone; dont put it off upon me.
austen|Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all!
dickens|Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or no, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the journey from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered, never to have seen.
austen|As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad, said he.
dickens|He had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud, ever since.
austen|He is so very superior.
dickens|I think it probable, said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort, that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite unforeseen by its subject.
austen|Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles.
dickens|After a little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went on board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering.
dickens|There is no one in that room behind you!
dickens|Yes; for a walk with me.
austen|And what did she say?
austen|Nobody, who has not been in the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be.
austen|We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday.
austen|forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be happy with him?
dickens|However, I did not trouble Wemmick with these particulars.
austen|No, never.
austen|Jane was distressed.
dickens|Still, lookee here, Pip.
dickens|However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last too far to the right, and consequently had to try back along the riverside, on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide out.
dickens|Am I not?
dickens|Mr Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.
dickens|Oh!
austen|This is not pleasant to you, Emmaand it is very far from pleasant to me; but I must, I will,I will tell you truths while I can; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now.
austen|Every body must have seen the snow coming on.
dickens|I have never had any such thing.
austen|Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me to expressI hope you will believeExcuse me for being so entirely without words.
austen|I was ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well.
dickens|He therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellsons for the first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same room.
austen|You find me trying to be useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.
dickens|Monseigneur was in his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without.
dickens|interrupted Biddy, looking closely at the leaf in her hand.
austen|How strange!
dickens|The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and deserted.
austen|Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waitingwoman was in it.
dickens|Not a theory; it was a fancy.
dickens|And between them and the whitehaired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall.
dickens|They see my Fathers face.
austen|These were charming feelingsbut not lasting.
dickens|They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.
dickens|I have an association with the nameand with the face.
dickens|The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh water, and asked for another glass of cognac.
austen|of what sort?
dickens|If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated one another regularly every morning.
dickens|Yes, sir.
austen|Thank Heaven!
austen|My reasons for believing it are briefly these It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable.
austen|Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.
austen|Very extraordinary!
austen|He should be happy to see Mrs Goddard.
dickens|We have lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the assertion of our station, in these days, might I do not go so far as to say would, but might cause us real inconvenience.
dickens|May I venture to congratulate you?
austen|She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshirethe extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from his answers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned, there was very little going on, that their visitings were among a range of great families, none very near; and that even when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even chance that Mrs Churchill were not in health and spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that, though he had his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty, without considerable address at times, that he could get away, or introduce an acquaintance for a night.
austen|I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be tempted; Mr Elton, you know, recollecting herself, is out of the question and I do not wish to see any such person.
austen|Mrs Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingleys visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.
dickens|On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union Jack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of defiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most pacific manner by the Aged.
austen|He will be a completely gross, vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of nothing but profit and loss.
austen|Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high.
dickens|This is she?
austen|Four nieces of Mrs Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.
austen|Her ideas only varied as to the how much.
dickens|Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions, obeyed them.
austen|Voices approached the shopor rather one voice and two ladies Mrs Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.
dickens|No man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine, if I knew how.
dickens|I opened my eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at the bedside, Joe.
dickens|Master, she said, in a low voice, with her eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him.
dickens|But I love her.
austen|Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.
dickens|That is my name.
austen|Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eyelashes and eyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom.
dickens|Or would it worry you just now?
austen|This is an alliance which, whoeverwhatever your friends may be, must be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools.
dickens|Yes.
austen|By all means.
austen|They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.
dickens|My opinion is, its a sedanchair.
austen|When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.
dickens|If you talk of strength, said Mr Jaggers, Ill show you a wrist.
dickens|But you never turn to at it, Biddy.
dickens|Gargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past six in the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the interment on Monday next at three oclock in the afternoon.
austen|Oh!
austen|cried Emma, collecting herself resolutelyLet us understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake.
dickens|I thank you even more for the tone of the question.
dickens|Indeed, sir, pursued the nephew, for anything I know, you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me.
dickens|The official turned towards him with sudden distrust.
dickens|she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way.
austen|He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at others.
austen|We are quite well.
austen|but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.
dickens|We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too far, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet time.
austen|
dickens|Very fine young lady!
dickens|Is he right, that man?
dickens|At the Hulks?
austen|They have some of the finest woods in the country.
dickens|But the question is, what do you say of it?
dickens|I am not old, but my young way was never the way to age.
dickens|I come upon her from behind, as I come upon you tonight.
austen|This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were halfhours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.
dickens|Supposing him wrapped up as those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them?
austen|His perception of the striking improvement of Harriets manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.
austen|Dear Miss Woodhouse!
austen|But they live very comfortably.
dickens|He knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.
austen|When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane.
dickens|I stand corrected; do you supposeyou go so far as to suppose, sometimes?
dickens|You are not the gaolers daughter?
austen|We are sure of excellent fires, continued he, and every thing in the greatest comfort.
dickens|Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.
dickens|Yet, no one had followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wineshop, though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.
austen|The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyships desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.
austen|Thank you.
austen|There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner.
dickens|May the Devil carry away these idiots!
dickens|Is she married?
dickens|The pupils then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon whose toes.
dickens|Now, said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and conclusive, I will tell you what to say to Joseph.
dickens|I could hardly begin but Herbert must begin too, so he soon followed.
dickens|On the road except at Beauvais he had heard absolutely nothing.
austen|What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?
austen|He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.
dickens|said his friend Stryver, you take it more easily than I fancied you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will.
austen|Let us make the best of itand, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour.
austen|Oh!
dickens|I wish to pay for them, I addedotherwise I thought he might only pretend to make them, with ready money.
austen|Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouchelandau; it will be so very much preferable.
dickens|Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to be best answered by itself, I said, Halloa!
austen|Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father, and so delighted with Mrs Weston; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a wouldbe lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners.
dickens|Likeways for myself, sir, Joe returned.
dickens|Nothing.
austen|And I have no doubt that he will thrive, and be a very rich man in timeand his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us.
dickens|I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital.
dickens|He advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition of such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the functions of explainer and director of all my studies.
austen|How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!
dickens|Good night!
austen|We have heard nothing from town.
austen|hang Kitty!
austen|She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart, for he stopped to hand her out.
dickens|Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields.
dickens|With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in through the crevice in the wall.
dickens|said he.
austen|Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me.
austen|The like reserve prevailed on other topics.
dickens|said I, half suspecting him to be mad.
dickens|There were solitary patches of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr Lorry, mindful of footpads, always retained Jerry for this service though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier.
austen|You confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life!
austen|Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.
dickens|This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid.
austen|Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about among such friends!
austen|To chuse to remain here month after month, under privations of every sort!
austen|We never see any thing of it on our clubnights.
dickens|I grant you I see the arm, says the man, but I dont see the good.
dickens|O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife!
austen|It now first struck her, that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
dickens|Sydney, said Mr Stryver, on that selfsame night, or morning, to his jackal; mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you.
dickens|Wrote in print even!
austen|Mr Dixon is very musical, is he?
dickens|Even when I thought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when I recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and tones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,even then I was pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Dont go home.
dickens|Wopsle, too, took pains to present me in the worst light.
austen|So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart.
austen|And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance.
dickens|she whispered.
dickens|All in good time.
dickens|Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap of paper.
austen|how would she have behaved?
dickens|But to be proud and hard to me!
dickens|Never mixing with any natural ties, never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is!
austen|An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!
austen|A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but halfdeserved.
dickens|It lay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the tools and barrows that were lying about.
dickens|Miss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was better than I had thought possible, seeing what he was there; and took up a little bag from the table beside her.
austen|Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.
austen|It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.
dickens|What do you suppose, said Mr Jaggers, bending forward to look at the ground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,what do you suppose you are living at the rate of?
austen|Their first object was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.
dickens|No.
dickens|Mr Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended.
dickens|She turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it, and, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her knees at my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which, when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have been raised to heaven from her mothers side.
austen|Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose illhealth having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.
dickens|Ah!
austen|I quite detest the man.
austen|poor Miss Taylor!
dickens|When I had induced Provis to go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions Startop by this time knew the state of the case, and held another council.
dickens|And which it is to be took into account that if it wos, it wouldnt, even then, be all o one side.
austen|He may have a great deal of influence on some points, continued Mrs Weston, and on others, very little and among those, on which she is beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us.
dickens|Then the strongrooms underground, at Tellsons, with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger and it was not a little that he knew about them, opened before him, and he went in among them with the great keys and the feeblyburning candle, and found them safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.
dickens|We went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two chains across it outside,and the first thing I noticed was, that the passages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.
dickens|I didnt see; but I didnt say so.
dickens|In a byyard, there was a wilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that was gone,and in this respect I remember those recluses as being like most others.
austen|They are jealous even of his regard for his father.
dickens|The word wife seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say with sudden impatience, In the name of that sharp female newlyborn, and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?
dickens|I then rejoined Mr Wemmick, and affecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised by the information I had received, accepted his offer.
dickens|It had been delivered by hand of course, since I left home, and its contents were these  If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes tonight or tomorrow night at nine, and to come to the little sluicehouse by the limekiln, you had better come.
dickens|Recollect the admission you have made, and dont try to go from it presently.
dickens|When my servant came into the room where I sat with my wifeO my wife, beloved of my heart!
austen|In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,the weather appearing exactly right.
dickens|he said, touching it.
austen|Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her fortunethough her fortune bore no proportion to the familyestatewas not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the infinite mortification of Mr and Mrs Churchill, who threw her off with due decorum.
dickens|Those two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer; our charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our object, we should make way enough.
austen|It is more than I engage for, I assure you.
austen|Elizabeth made no answer.
dickens|On the contrary; I come direct.
austen|Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.
dickens|Ill tell you something, returned the sergeant; I suspect that stuffs of your providing.
austen|He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her  I dare say you will find him very agreeable.
dickens|I did so, raising the boys head against my knee.
dickens|I am instructed to communicate to him, said Mr Jaggers, throwing his finger at me sideways, that he will come into a handsome property.
austen|Very odd!
austen|I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.
dickens|But our ways are different ways, none the less.
dickens|It had stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many wooden shoes.
austen|Has he been here on this occasionor has he not?
austen|The weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy.
dickens|The moon began to rise, and I thought of the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had heard on earth.
austen|what can it be?
dickens|Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle had closed the book, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking his head, and saying, Take warning, boy, take warning!
austen|Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault.
dickens|When he had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back  Is Lucie the topic?
austen|Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody.
dickens|It was daylight when we reached the Temple, and I went at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.
austen|But I shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding.
dickens|Howsever they come, they didnt ought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to the same.
dickens|I sagaciously observed, if it didnt signify to him, to whom did it signify?
dickens|She always made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price, one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.
austen|The How dye dos were quiet and constrained on each side.
dickens|I was greatly dejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way.
austen|I have read worse charades.
austen|He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it.
dickens|What could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical interruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he meant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs Joe; and further whether he was man enough to come on?
dickens|No!
austen|Oh, my dear Lizzy!
dickens|Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no suspicion of the fact; Mr Lorry could have none.
austen|Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?
austen|But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for herfor a woman who had already refused himas able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.
austen|Why should he marry?
dickens|Very well, said Mr Jaggers.
austen|He trifles here, said he, as to the temptation.
austen|Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds.
dickens|Of me.
dickens|said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with delight.
dickens|Did you hear who it was, Joe?
dickens|Is that the Dover mail?
dickens|Pray, Doctor Manette, said Mr Darnay, as they sat under the planetreeand he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand, which happened to be the old buildings of Londonhave you seen much of the Tower?
dickens|I thought it would be very good for me if I could get her out of my head, with all the rest of those remembrances and fancies, and could go to work determined to relish what I had to do, and stick to it, and make the best of it.
austen|It soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again.
austen|When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two menservants go with her.
austen|Yes, said John Knightley, and I think we shall have a good deal of it.
austen|You have done all this!
austen|Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.
dickens|We shall mount to a hundred soon.
austen|He had never been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful a welljudging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.
dickens|After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by the collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me againat first, vacantlythen, with a gradually concentrating attention.
austen|Emma knew that he had, on that occasion, found her much superior to his expectation.
austen|Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.
austen|I hope you will drink to our good journey.
austen|He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend his evening at Hartfield.
dickens|As she gave it to me playfully,for her darker mood had been but Momentary,I held it and put it to my lips.
dickens|Thats loaded, that is.
austen|I came to you without a doubt of my reception.
austen|Mrs Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of for I cannot depend upon his coming.
austen|There was merit in every drawingin the least finished, perhaps the most; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same.
dickens|Did you tell him to lock her and bar her in?
austen|Yes, always, she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, I remember hearing you once say, Mr Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.
dickens|Quite so, sir!
austen|If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.
dickens|And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that there was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?
dickens|I am sorry for it.
dickens|Theres another conwict off.
austen|Oh!
dickens|Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn of minor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner.
dickens|Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had been an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments and punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had made his escape and been resentenced to exile for life.
dickens|The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as big as he was, and four times as offensive.
austen|Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.
austen|You are mistaken.
dickens|A fouroared galley, did you say?
dickens|In pursuance of this luminous conception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr Wopsles greataunts at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart all her learning to me.
austen|It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.
dickens|I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both hands, and said, If you would kindly please to let me keep upright, sir, perhaps I shouldnt be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.
austen|And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over, said Emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them into the lane again.
austen|Oh!
dickens|If that will be a consolation to you, yes.
dickens|That Orlick!
dickens|This was the Carmagnole.
dickens|fell to at his breakfast.
austen|Perfection should not have come quite so soon.
austen|Even Mr Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, Ah!
austen|What is before me, I see.
austen|Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs Bennet, for many years after Lydias birth, had been certain that he would.
dickens|What was it?
austen|Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy, replied Jane; but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.
austen|Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else Mr Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.
dickens|But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench.
austen|I wish Hetty had not gone.
austen|I shall not discuss it here.
austen|To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.
austen|I have often thought them the worst of the two, replied he coolly.
austen|cried the goodhearted Mrs John Knightley.
dickens|I reasoned as I had reasoned already without knowing it,if that be reasoning,in case any harm should befall him through my not going, how could I ever forgive myself!
austen|This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr Knightley.
austen|She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did.
austen|The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emmas side, to enable her to say on reply,  Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr Knightley is the last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does.
dickens|Thankee, Sir, said Joe, stiff from head to foot, Ill take whichever is most agreeable to yourself.
austen|Perry tells me that Mr Cole never touches malt liquor.
dickens|Indeed, I was not only so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and so differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could have known me without accidental help.
austen|Bromley, of course.
dickens|Then, what submission, what cringing and fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation!
dickens|No direct answer could have been half so forcible.
dickens|She put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work, upon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my hair.
austen|The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions.
austen|He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.
austen|My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
dickens|What is this decree that the smith spoke of?
dickens|Oh!
dickens|I understand it to do so.
dickens|I shouldnt, said Mr Carton.
dickens|But I have heard him constantly.
austen|She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.
dickens|I accepted the offer.
dickens|He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter.
dickens|And afterwards we would fall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.
austen|Consider Mr Collinss respectability, and Charlottes steady, prudent character.
austen|I am in a fine flow of spirits, ant I?
austen|Mrs Goddard was the mistress of a Schoolnot of a seminary, or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality, upon new principles and new systemsand where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanitybut a real, honest, oldfashioned Boardingschool, where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies.
austen|Miss Hawkins,I dare say, an excellent young woman.
austen|Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced.
austen|She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.
dickens|As if the Gorgons head had surveyed it, when it was finished, two centuries ago.
dickens|Next day I set myself to get the boat.
dickens|A little redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what does it signify to Me?
dickens|Yes, replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.
austen|He told her that he had been impatient to leave the diningroomhated sitting longwas always the first to move when he couldthat his father, Mr Knightley, Mr Cox, and Mr Cole, were left very busy over parish businessthat as long as he had staid, however, it had been pleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogetherthought it so abundant in agreeable familiesthat Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much.
dickens|But how?
dickens|For several reasons, and not least because I didnt clearly know what Mr Jaggers would be found to be at, I replied in the affirmative.
dickens|Now think of it, Sydney.
dickens|I represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted.
dickens|She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up and down, walking up and down, until he is composed.
dickens|Cover him steady, men!
austen|But you know they were your own words, that more wonderful things had happened, matches of greater disparity had taken place than between Mr Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred beforeand if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as toif Mr Knightley should reallyif he does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way.
dickens|We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and duty.
dickens|He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have been a part of her halfbrothers scheme, said Herbert.
dickens|What did you say?
austen|I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning.
dickens|He was a French gentleman; a scientific gentleman; a man of great acquirementsa Doctor.
austen|His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an illnatured tone, that she wished they might be happy.
austen|The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family.
austen|It is the greatest absurdityActually snowing at this moment!
dickens|Halloa!
austen|Is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of your affections, he might be alluding to Mr Martinhe might have Mr Martins interest in view?
dickens|said Miss Pocket.
dickens|Now, observe!
austen|And so you actually put this piece of courtplaister by for his sake!
dickens|He holds the same relation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise.
dickens|It would be dangerous for Charles yet.
dickens|Was there a great sensation?
dickens|The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and, abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.
austen|for myself, I protest I must be excused, said Mrs Elton; I really cannot attemptI am not at all fond of the sort of thing.
austen|He seemed to me very well off as he was.
dickens|She knows better.
austen|He said no more.
dickens|What do you want?
dickens|cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair, and here are the tumbrils!
austen|Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs Goddards today; and she may be detained by a visitor, without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.
dickens|returned madame, in a high voice.
austen|If the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I am not here, by my grandmamas.
dickens|Ill do as much with it as him, said Orlick.
dickens|Bah!
austen|as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet.
austen|Excellent Parsonage House!
dickens|The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone home, and the Stryver principal opened the door.
austen|But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.
austen|They told methat Mr Martin dined with them last Saturday.
dickens|Mr Stryver, a man of little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout, loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing way of shouldering himself morally and physically into companies and conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.
austen|The sphere in which she moves is much above his.
dickens|I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my birthday was.
austen|She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs Goddards, but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.
dickens|The same Sydney, with the same luck.
dickens|Hulks!
austen|I am sure Miss Nash wouldfor Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a linendraper.
dickens|So far, we are not pursued.
dickens|And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.
dickens|I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy.
dickens|Think of him!
dickens|Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a very different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La Force, he heard One struck away from him, without surprise.
austen|I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed.
dickens|I think he would not be much the better for the mother.
austen|She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham.
dickens|Mr Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, How should I know?
austen|Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates?
austen|and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too!
dickens|He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as I had reason to know thereafter.
dickens|inquired the first.
dickens|I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss Havisham, I murmured.
austen|Here have we been, the whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear.
dickens|Go on then, said Defarge.
dickens|What may your meaning be, Mr Lorry?
austen|I do not know which it ought to be called.
austen|On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.
dickens|Did you ever see her in it, uncle?
dickens|We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us.
austen|She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.
dickens|I am weary, weary, wearyworn down by misery.
dickens|A better proof of the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded, than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to find him employment.
dickens|I was haunted by the file too.
dickens|That at least is true, said Mr Lorry.
dickens|You comfort me so much!
austen|I am sure there is nobodys praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouses.
austen|She could never see a fault in any of them.
austen|Oh!
dickens|That I am too old?
austen|What a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!
dickens|Wed be puzzled how to bring down a jailbird on the wing, tonight.
austen|Gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she had been asked.
dickens|Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet, clinging to his hand.
dickens|He was a broadshouldered looselimbed swarthy fellow of great strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching.
dickens|There, said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Prosss lips with his own.
dickens|How say you?
dickens|Mr Pumblechook.
dickens|The dejected Mrs Cruncher shook her head.
dickens|Like you, you fool!
austen|But I can assure you, she added, that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.
austen|Yes, next week.
austen|Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.
austen|She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.
austen|He stopped at Highbury, at the Batess, I fancy, some timeand then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.
dickens|I know, my dear, I know.
dickens|I asked.
austen|my dear, said Iwell, and just then came the note.
dickens|Go and sit down in your chair this moment!
dickens|Defarge and his wife looked steadfastly at one another.
austen|my sweetest Lizzy!
austen|Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can.
dickens|Amen!
dickens|I think it would hardly serve her to establish her parentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to disgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for life.
dickens|Yes.
austen|She answered him with cold civility.
dickens|Yes, says Compeysons wife.
austen|She did not think it in Harriets nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.
dickens|And your books too, turning his eyes round the room, mounting up, on their shelves, by hundreds!
austen|Mr Knightley is coming too.
austen|madam, cried Emma, if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly earned.
austen|he is off.
dickens|To be registered, as doomed to destruction, returned Defarge.
austen|You will get very tired when tea is over.
dickens|A stronger pressure on my hand.
dickens|But as to not thinking of you in the nightThe idea!
austen|I think there is a little likeness between us.
austen|Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat, and backgammon.
dickens|No, sir, returned Wemmick; it was going by post, when you brought Mr Pip into the office.
austen|She was displeased; I thought unreasonably so I thought her, on a thousand occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious I thought her even cold.
austen|We seem to have been designed for each other.
dickens|Googood night, sir, I faltered.
dickens|Let me remember, then, what he said as to that.
austen|Oh!
austen|I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon.
dickens|Business!
dickens|Where, repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him whatever, are the papers of this prisoner?
dickens|Have you heard, Joe, I asked him that evening, upon further consideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, who my patron was?
austen|I am perfectly serious in my refusal.
austen|She received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.
dickens|You, devoted and young, cannot fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be wasted  She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated the word.
dickens|My dear, I have seen it bleeding.
dickens|Pip?
austen|I never saw Mrs Weston better in my lifenever looking so well.
dickens|It is in the present mode.
austen|We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.
dickens|Is it your own, Mr Wemmick?
dickens|Yes; to you.
austen|pray make haste and come into the diningroom, for there is such a sight to be seen!
austen|She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side.
austen|Mrs Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections as these, was one of the happiest women in the world.
dickens|It was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for the whippingpost, another dear old institution, very humanising and softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in bloodmoney, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under Heaven.
dickens|The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here, pointing with his hand, near to the window of my establishment.
austen|Mrs Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about.
dickens|His touch still lingered on her fathers hand.
dickens|By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation.
austen|But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.
dickens|The postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble overswinging lamps.
austen|But first of all, there must be an answer written to Mrs Cole.
dickens|I reflected for some time, and then answered as if I had discovered a new idea, I mean pretty well.
dickens|Take another glass of wine, and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to be so strictly conscientious in emptying ones glass, as to turn it bottom upwards with the rim on ones nose.
austen|The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background.
dickens|If you will lock the door to secure us from interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back, as quiet as you leave him.
austen|It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.
austen|GARDINER.
austen|I knew he would!
austen|Her intentions were unchanged.
dickens|Let us go on.
austen|seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her, even towards some of those who loved her best.
dickens|When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life, and my fathers.
austen|But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them.
dickens|Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if I unreasonably fancied I think I did that, if I let her go, the fire would break out again and consume her.
dickens|But, if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!
austen|Oh!
dickens|With two companions.
dickens|He wiped himself again, as he had done before, and then slowly took his tangle of tobacco from his pocket, and plucked his pipe from his buttonhole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.
dickens|Tonight, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my untouched bread and butter on the other.
dickens|Is there no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your mind, Monsieur Manette?
dickens|She shook her head.
austen|I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs Elton, I am obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer.
austen|are sufficiently known.
austen|Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his wife.
dickens|They turned into the wineshop, which was closed for it was midnight, and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally dismissed him to bed.
dickens|Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr Stryver on the shoulder, and said  I know the fellow.
dickens|Better not to mention the subject, anywhere or in any way, and to remove himfor a while at all eventsout of France.
dickens|AM I!
austen|It would be a degradation.
dickens|Any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no suppression or evasion so far.
dickens|I walked into the wineshop here, close after you, and sat near you.
austen|True.
dickens|he said, after consideration.
dickens|The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold of his bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sisters observation.
austen|To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr Bingleys being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.
austen|You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five couple there will be plenty of room.
dickens|with the old restless fingers.
dickens|This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness for the means of getting a light.
dickens|She did not greatly alter in appearance.
austen|I, who may so soon have to guard others!
dickens|I judged the person to be with him, returned the watchman.
austen|And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?
austen|Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!
austen|What were nine miles to a young man?
dickens|An elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the gate.
austen|Knightley is quite the gentleman.
dickens|If you want any mo  How am I going to live?
dickens|The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a celestial witness.
austen|Is not she an angel in every gesture?
dickens|no, nor yet his half fardenshalf fardens!
dickens|The populace cried enthusiastically, No!
austen|always my kindest friend on every occasion.
austen|Will not it be a good plan?
dickens|You know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous roll of addleheaded predecessors; now, dont you?
austen|Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins, was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.
austen|You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mothers permission for this address.
austen|My object then, replied Darcy, was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.
austen|You must answer it of courseand speedily.
austen|Let it stay, however, said she; give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back.
austen|I want to have your opinion of her looks.
dickens|Certainly not.
austen|Well, my dear, he deliberately began, considering we never saw her before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you.
austen|He looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,  Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it.
dickens|I released the leg of the table, and ran for my life.
austen|People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.
dickens|It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my dazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon.
austen|I do not think it could disagree with you.
austen|One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax.
austen|She felt that she had been risking her friends happiness on most insufficient grounds.
austen|It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr Martin.
dickens|Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this.
dickens|I found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than six little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up.
dickens|Why, you have always told me all day long.
dickens|Twice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his forefinger drew a cross in the air.
austen|She did indeed.
austen|May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?
dickens|One more.
dickens|So, said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and without the least glance at me,so youre the blacksmith, are you?
dickens|I might as well ask you, said Biddy, how you manage?
dickens|They laugh and pick him up again.
dickens|In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting.
dickens|Well; and a little bit of him.
dickens|It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out of it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in lightning.
dickens|I dressed him.
dickens|Dont torture a poor forlorn wretch, he implored them, with a dreadful cry; but give me my work!
dickens|Ill eat my breakfast afore theyre the death of me, said he.
dickens|Twilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air.
dickens|This account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I had done.
dickens|Monseigneur?
dickens|Pointing with his pen at the office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the purposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe.
austen|She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which silenced, Mr Knightley.
austen|Yesthat is what makes it amusing.
dickens|I can scarcely believe it now.
austen|Of the same ageand always knowing herI ought to have been more her friend.
austen|His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their mutual good to outweigh every drawback.
austen|Depend upon it, that was the case and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.
dickens|I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd.
austen|And I assure you, Mr Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour.
dickens|Our lesson is, that there are two Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the Surrey Richmond.
austen|Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.
dickens|Mr Wopsle, conceding his fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately shoved into a dusty corner, while everybody danced a hornpipe; and from that corner, surveying the public with a discontented eye, became aware of me.
dickens|To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St.
austen|Nothing wanting.
austen|But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again, so near as town.
austen|He feared there must be some decided involvement.
dickens|Times soon forgotten!
austen|After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last month, to Miss Smithsuch attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observingto be addressing me in this mannerthis is an unsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible!
austen|I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr Darcy has no defect.
dickens|One afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the wharf at dusk.
austen|But I thought he would have staid now, and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned....
dickens|Its him!
dickens|Is not that my right?
dickens|It is bad weather, gentlemen, said Defarge, shaking his head.
austen|Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward.
austen|I shall not say you are mistaken, he replied, because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own.
dickens|He felt it to be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days, he knew that he must face it.
austen|Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for each, for all three.
dickens|For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr Cruncher had discharged the office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the basket.
dickens|He had a badly bruised face, said I, recalling what I hardly knew I knew.
dickens|Therese Defarge, his wife.
austen|Dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama?
dickens|Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no French.
dickens|This gave me opportunities of being with him that I could not otherwise have had.
austen|Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.
austen|I think you play quite as well as she does.
austen|I never could have supposed it.
austen|In the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the very next morning, and it should be the beginning, on her side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.
austen|If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor dishonesty I must call it.
dickens|You are going to dine?
austen|He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma was convinced that it had been so.
dickens|He does not make it, said I, and has never made it, and has no knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.
dickens|I dont know what possessed me, Joe, I replied, letting his shirt sleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head; but I wish you hadnt taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I wish my boots werent so thick nor my hands so coarse.
austen|Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.
dickens|Not a word was spoken.
austen|At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way!
dickens|Miss Skiffinss composure while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever seen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically.
dickens|Happily, however, there was sleep in Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness jingling through the untimely cold and wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.
dickens|As I said to you when I first came, I had better not see her.
dickens|To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd.
dickens|Think of what she is herself now I am repulsive and you abominate me.
austen|She and the children might stay very well.
dickens|As our charge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within a boat or twos length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch the stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us.
austen|I cannot think there is any danger of it, was Emmas calm answerand when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfaxs situation and understand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs Campbell, I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.
austen|She related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.
dickens|The truth is, my dear Charles, Mr Lorry glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved.
austen|That may bebut not by sketches in Swisserland.
dickens|Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.
austen|I hope it does him some service with you.
austen|My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?
dickens|Instantly, all the rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole.
dickens|Well, Herbert?
dickens|They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many.
dickens|If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so I would do it if I could; but its so new here, and so strange, and so fine,and melancholy.
dickens|Upon this we all took courage to unite in a confirmatory murmur.
austen|Oh!
austen|I wonder he did not remember the bookwas all Harriets answer, and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself.
austen|Emma was silenced.
austen|Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs Elton, Mrs Weston ventured this apology for Jane.
dickens|The pupils ate apples and put straws down one anothers backs, until Mr Wopsles greataunt collected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with a birchrod.
dickens|I reposed complete confidence in no one but Biddy; but I told poor Biddy everything.
austen|GARDINER.
dickens|Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it, and had passed from its surface and this earths together.
austen|Such an adventure as this,a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain.
dickens|As if it were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again soon.
dickens|I should think not!
dickens|Not to lose a moment of the time.
dickens|Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop, returned madame; but dont tell me.
dickens|You think much of me.
austen|But I hope she is pretty well, sir.
dickens|You deceive yourself, monsieur, returned the keeper of the wineshop.
dickens|He took out of his pocket a great thick pocketbook, bursting with papers, and tossed it on the table.
austen|The very day of Mr Eltons going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emmas services towards her friend.
dickens|Look at your boy he is yourn, aint he?
austen|She wished him to speak, but he would not.
dickens|Whats that?
austen|Very serious!
dickens|It was such a very provoking question for it had never in the most distant manner occurred to me, that I said, snappishly,  Biddy, what do you mean?
dickens|The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting.
dickens|I quickened my pace, and knocked at the door with my hand.
austen|Emma knew what was coming; they must have the letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies ball had been; and she went through it very well, with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite, and always putting forward to prevent Harriets being obliged to say a word.
austen|Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr Woodhouses family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma.
dickens|Well?
austen|Now I have got some news for you, said Lydia, as they sat down at table.
dickens|It did.
austen|When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
austen|Mr Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.
dickens|Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five shillings, and appointed me for next night.
austen|One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.
austen|Well, so much the better.
dickens|Herbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire.
austen|You pass it over very handsomelybut you were perfectly right.
dickens|There was a tray ready on a sidetable.
austen|What is passable in youth is detestable in later age.
austen|I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.
austen|allow me to interpret this interesting silence.
austen|Mrs Weston, your argument weighs most with me.
austen|At last, and tolerably in his usual tone, he said,  I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.
austen|I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.
dickens|Its not long, you see, guard.
austen|You blushing as she spoke who can see into every bodys heart; but nobody else  Upon my word, said Emma, I begin to doubt my having any such talent.
austen|The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing done.
austen|He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps  My dear papa, he is threeandtwenty.
dickens|Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself on the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father had been chewing, and cogitated.
austen|Oh!
austen|Well, well, means to make her an offer then.
austen|He had still a small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away.
dickens|When I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forget Joes recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and unthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how common Estella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith; how thick his boots, and how coarse his hands.
dickens|It may be too late, I dont know, but let it not be a minute later!
austen|We never were so long without seeing her before, and as I was telling Mrs Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now.
austen|But my dear Lydia, I dont at all like your going such a way off.
austen|My situation in life, my connections with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.
austen|The style of the visit, and the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive.
dickens|I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say so.
austen|You know nothing of the matter.
dickens|I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let us say no more about it.
austen|No one made any reply.
austen|Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.
austen|I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got into.
austen|Oh, lord!
austen|for my mother was so afraid that we had not any saltingpan large enough.
dickens|You must know, said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and beautiful woman might, that I have no heart,if that has anything to do with my memory.
dickens|Hed never have no good of it; hed want all along to be out of the line, if he, could see his way out, being once ineven if it wos so.
dickens|I hope it may be taken into account one day, when all days are at an end for me!
austen|Your picture may be very exact, Louisa, said Bingley; but this was all lost upon me.
dickens|Where is he?
dickens|I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love that was I.
austen|Lady Catherine then observed,  Your fathers estate is entailed on Mr Collins, I think.
dickens|O, look at her, dear Carton!
dickens|Eh well!
austen|I am sure, neither your father nor Mrs Weston poor Miss Taylor that was would suffer it.
dickens|That perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster yet, he of course knew now.
austen|How has Wright done my hair?
dickens|!
dickens|Two OnePound notes?
austen|Mrs Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr Joness shopboy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr Collins by Janes introduction of him.
dickens|He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs, from the corners of his mouth to his ears.
austen|Emma grew sick at the sound.
dickens|cried Biddy, with an exultant face.
austen|Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded.
austen|She is superior to Mr Robert Martin.
dickens|Dont be so good to me!
austen|Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.
dickens|This is very discouraging, said I.
austen|Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.
dickens|Forbid it, miss!
dickens|Why wouldnt you go?
austen|She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.
austen|If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.
dickens|You werent.
dickens|The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally awaken, with such feelings roused.
austen|You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so.
dickens|Yes.
dickens|These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than ever.
dickens|I think?
dickens|The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair, and a certain indescribable intensity of face not of an active kind, but pondering and selfcommuning.
dickens|I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her while she remained here?
dickens|First, said Mr Jaggers, you should have some new clothes to come in, and they should not be workingclothes.
austen|I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head.
dickens|If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a yard or two of a mans nose, he can see it without a perspectiveglass.
austen|No, sir, replied his son, laughing, I seem to have had it from nobody.
dickens|O God bless you, God forgive you!
austen|can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?
austen|Very well.
dickens|Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright position on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms  You bring me, tomorrow morning early, that file and them wittles.
austen|Her affection must have overpowered her judgment.
austen|Be satisfied, said he, I will not raise any outcry.
dickens|One.
austen|At a wateringplace, or in a common London acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points.
austen|my dear sir, how are you this morning?
austen|she could not endure the thought!
dickens|Look at me.
dickens|That, in the prison he had found a selfappointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be massacred, or to be released, or in a few cases to be sent back to their cells.
austen|I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us.
dickens|I have found out who my patron is.
dickens|This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child; a little child of whom Provis was exceedingly fond.
dickens|There, there!
dickens|But if you could oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.
dickens|Get behind the door, old chap, and have the jacktowel betwixt you.
dickens|Poor fellow!
austen|He may be very amiable, have very good manners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people nothing really amiable about him.
dickens|Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a lonely road.
dickens|When we had conversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the neglected garden on our coming in by and by, she said, I should wheel her about a little, as in times of yore.
dickens|I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie comprehended in the answer No.
dickens|There were periodical occasions when Mr Jaggers and Wemmick went over the office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things straight.
austen|For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs Coles noteno, it cannot be more than fiveor at least tenfor I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come outI was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the porkJane was standing in the passagewere not you, Jane?
austen|Jamess, with very decent composure.
dickens|He must go to Paris.
austen|Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
dickens|It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment, said Madame Defarge.
dickens|I had not the power to attend to it.
dickens|I think them injudicious, but I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.
austen|All was joy and kindness.
dickens|Which of the two goes first?
dickens|Eh well!
austen|Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first.
dickens|Her forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon the counsel for and against.
dickens|Here.
dickens|No gleam of fire, no glittering shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and still.
austen|It is a very cold afternoonbut in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.
dickens|Go tell her that I wish to see her.
austen|They are very importantand sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them.
dickens|Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off, with his hair as stiff as his fathers.
austen|My younger sister has left all her friendshas eloped; has thrown herself into the power ofof Mr Wickham.
austen|I, who have valued myself on my abilities!
dickens|Dear me!
austen|And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper.
austen|But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent.
dickens|I dont know, I moodily answered.
dickens|Yes, sir.
austen|Mr Frank Churchill, indeed!
austen|What you ask, said Elizabeth, is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr Darcy had much better finish his letter.
austen|For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcys; but you shall do as you choose.
dickens|Yes, sir.
dickens|Tolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time.
dickens|Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with playful effect.
dickens|And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind hearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me!
austen|Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience.
austen|The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.
dickens|This had been so very noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about, Who are they?
dickens|There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged, and the sergeant answered.
dickens|I hope Mr Jaggers admires it?
dickens|Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any account, I asked her why she did not like him.
austen|Upon my honour, said he very seriously, it does not.
austen|Good Mrs Stokes would not know her own room again.
dickens|Pip, old chap!
dickens|MR.
austen|Very true.
austen|yesverya very pleasing young woman.
austen|I am not ashamed of having been mistakenor, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.
austen|I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.
dickens|As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked in very indifferent French for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.
austen|My father and Mrs Weston are at the Crown at this moment, said Frank Churchill, examining the capabilities of the house.
austen|If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane Fairfaxs.
austen|While he lived, it must be only an engagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.
austen|My dear, dear Lizzy, I wouldI do congratulate youbut are you certain?
austen|If they are not put off, he cannot stir.
dickens|Oh dear me, sir?
dickens|That is, it doesnt pay me anything, and I have tokeep myself.
dickens|Very glad, Im sure, to make your acquaintance.
austen|It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.
austen|I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.
austen|You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.
austen|Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.
dickens|I know what youre a going to say, Pip; stay a bit!
dickens|I am afraid he is a sad old rascal, said Herbert, smiling, but I have never seen him.
dickens|As the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for a moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian.
austen|I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.
austen|After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more, he replied,  If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that already.
dickens|Spooney!
dickens|You are summoned for tomorrow.
dickens|The day I left England!
austen|Oh!
dickens|Large or small?
dickens|I shall be there before the commencement.
austen|Yes, yes, pray pass me, added her husband, with a sort of sneering consciousness; I have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse, or any other young lady.
austen|Well, my dear, said he, as they entered the roomI have brought her, and now I hope you will soon be better.
austen|On this subject, what can you have to say?
dickens|I dont want to know.
dickens|I have got so out of it!
austen|She had obtained private intelligence that Mr Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.
austen|A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart.
austen|replied he.
dickens|And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make no difference in my remembrance of you.
dickens|Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects, Mr Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire.
austen|no, my love; but you will soon be tired.
austen|Yet it is hard, she sometimes thought, that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation!
austen|With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.
dickens|My father, Pip, he were given to drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at my mother, most onmerciful.
austen|But you must have found it very damp and dirty.
dickens|VERB.
austen|Oh, yes!
dickens|Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman, and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after the situation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess.
dickens|I told her not to come near us till he was dead.
dickens|There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a run of confidence upon us!
dickens|Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door, combined with the joyringing, for music; not to mention his having an illomened lamp slung across the road before his postinghouse gate, which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.
dickens|No, no, no, said the uncle, pleasantly.
austen|He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance?
dickens|I dont care who says contrairy; I tell you so.
dickens|The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed him, when Mr Lorrys feet were arrested on the step by his asking, miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes.
austen|When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
dickens|But that I make no admissions?
dickens|From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention, they took him to the Doctors door.
austen|Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.
dickens|Put a name to it, Mr Gargery.
austen|She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.
austen|what a dear creature he is;I assure you I like him excessively.
dickens|And do you remember, retorted Mr Jaggers, that but for me you wouldnt be here and couldnt be here?
austen|But she is really quite the gentlewoman.
dickens|He looked rather sly when I mentioned Miss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a roll of the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.
dickens|Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.
dickens|Upon this, the Agedwho I believe would have been blown out of his armchair but for holding on by the elbowscried out exultingly, Hes fired!
austen|I had often seen him in love before.
dickens|Wife of Evremonde!
dickens|Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were alone, Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?
austen|Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings, as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.
dickens|Five paces by four and a half.
austen|We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.
austen|I wish we had a donkey.
dickens|Dear Carton!
dickens|Ah, Matthew, Matthew!
austen|It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.
dickens|I forgot it long ago.
austen|Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the cardtable, and stationed herself between Mr Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.
dickens|I should have been good enough for you; shouldnt I, Biddy?
austen|Her name was not mentioned;and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an illjudged solemnity of leavetaking in his graceful acknowledgments, as she thought, at first, could not escape her fathers suspicion.
austen|She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.
dickens|It came out that the whole of the back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front behind the coachman.
austen|Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.
austen|Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight.
dickens|At twenty minutes to nine?
austen|I cannot make him out.
dickens|He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon.
austen|In half a minute they were in the room.
austen|The very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the timewhen I saw him cominghis noble lookand my wretchedness before.
austen|Dear me!
dickens|He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of speaking to him when no one overheard.
austen|It would be a great disappointment to Mr John Knightley; consequently to Isabella.
dickens|A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge presented The Emigrant Evremonde.
dickens|They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.
dickens|And at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until the donor of the whole appears.
austen|It must be waded through, however.
austen|Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.
austen|My dear papa, I sent the whole hindquarter.
dickens|Not that anybody means to try, she added, for thats all done with, and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls.
austen|I cannot recollect.
dickens|asked Estella.
dickens|I said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken bits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in the morning.
dickens|Occasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could not bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors open and looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out; and when I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of such wind and rain, I saw that the lamps in the court were blown out, and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering, and that the coalfires in barges on the river were being carried away before the wind like redhot splashes in the rain.
dickens|Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the others words; both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what the unintelligible words meant.
dickens|Hulks are prisonships, right cross th meshes.
dickens|You cant have verbal communication with a man in New South Wales, you know.
dickens|What alone was wanting to the realization of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.
dickens|When he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker looked up.
dickens|That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back.
dickens|My father was so reduced that I was afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take care of him.
austen|From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.
austen|They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.
austen|She and Mrs Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together.
dickens|The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impressionwhich he himself had originatedthat he would not be released that night.
austen|He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.
austen|I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice.
dickens|said Miss Havisham.
dickens|It was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify him; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me, and known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time.
dickens|We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we might not be interrupted.
austen|She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to her.
austen|every day making me less fit to bear any other place.
dickens|Now, another great advantage of all this is, that it was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himself about your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged.
austen|What will Wickham say?
dickens|A moment more.
austen|You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me!
dickens|If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly would have paid money.
austen|Very happy to hear it.
dickens|I will come back, to see you off.
dickens|Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood, after this, was a question on which the Finches were divided.
austen|It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news, as proving that Mr Elton could not have suffered long; but she was sorry for Harriet Harriet must feel itand all that she could hope was, by giving the first information herself, to save her from hearing it abruptly from others.
austen|The rich brotherinlaw near Bristol was the pride of the alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him.
austen|I had not observed.
austen|My dear, said I, I shall say you are laid down upon the bed but, however, she is not; she is walking about the room.
dickens|In short, must leave it alone, like or no like.
dickens|When it turns at nine oclock, said Herbert, cheerfully, look out for us, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!
dickens|He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.
dickens|I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when you entered, that they tell me there isand no wonder!
austen|What was to be done?
austen|His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
austen|Wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyones congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.
austen|She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself, while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness, Very well, Mr Elton, very well indeed.
austen|I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.
austen|She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying  Is your sister at Pemberley still?
dickens|The Matthew whose place was to be at Miss Havishams head, when she lay dead, in her brides dress on the brides table.
dickens|It was a hot, wild night, and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place.
dickens|What next, I mean?
dickens|He set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and hed been to a public boardingschool and had learning.
dickens|When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow left when the drag was taken off.
dickens|He further gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to accord that grace to my two friends.
austen|Yes but a young ladya brideI ought to have paid my respects to her if possible.
dickens|My dear Biddy, I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a foremost place there, and little that ever had any place there.
austen|Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my witsand have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over mesuch spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.
dickens|Ever been kicked?
austen|I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I am going now.
dickens|There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had taken him last night, and Barsad.
austen|Nor did that day wear out her resentment.
dickens|I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would never be heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind.
dickens|The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight, in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their journey naturally tended.
austen|I meant only myself.
dickens|But Mr Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?
dickens|I really think this must be a man!
dickens|Take it away from her, take it away!
austen|He asked me if he could do any thing....
dickens|No, dear Doctor Manette.
austen|I should say, one of her ladyships carriages, for she has several.
austen|Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.
dickens|He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing of her fathers imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself, and that he had been as ignorant as she of his fathers and uncles responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read.
austen|Who should suffer but myself?
austen|I shall be very fit to see Janewhich is all I want.
dickens|Of course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything.
austen|I spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened away his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man!
austen|She could really say nothing.
dickens|You?
austen|Miss Bennet, replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.
dickens|It was not with me then, as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of the Passions, and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the disadvantage of both gentlemen.
austen|Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.
dickens|Molly, let them see your wrist.
austen|I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter.
austen|It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.
dickens|The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet streetcorner not far from Sohosquare.
austen|Oh!
dickens|A certain stop that Mr Jaggers came to in his mannerhe was too selfpossessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being brought to an indefinably attentive stopassured me that he did not know who her father was.
dickens|I began to think I should get over the day, when my sister said to Joe, Clean plates,cold.
dickens|I took the next opportunity; which was when she was waiting for Mrs Blandley to take her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go.
dickens|I wouldnt go into that, said Wemmick, evasively, it might clash with official responsibilities.
austen|Oh!
dickens|Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or five dull miles.
austen|You are not just to Harriets claims.
dickens|And last of all, Pip,and this I want to say very serious to you, old chap,I see so much in my poor mother, of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days, that Im dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing whats right by a woman, and Id fur rather of the two go wrong the tother way, and be a little illconwenienced myself.
austen|I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience, and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child.
austen|How strange this is!
austen|The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.
dickens|If I want you, I know where to find you; I dont want you to find me.
austen|On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.
dickens|Trouble?
austen|I do indeed.
austen|He thought principally of Mrs Churchills illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but they would all be safer at home.
austen|Had she followed Mr Knightleys known wishes, in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her better; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now.
dickens|I will, if you ask it.
dickens|The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she gave me her hand and a smile, and said good night, and was absorbed likewise.
dickens|It further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs Pocket reading in the garden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which her grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at all.
austen|But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea.
austen|I have nothing more to shew you, or to sayexcept that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to see me do it.
austen|Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.
austen|certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall.
dickens|And I hope to do mine.
dickens|The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.
austen|was Mr Woodhouses first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time.
dickens|I should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind.
dickens|After that, he drank all the rest of the sherry, and Mr Hubble drank the port, and the two talked which I have since observed to be customary in such cases as if they were of quite another race from the deceased, and were notoriously immortal.
austen|Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention.
dickens|She said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr Pumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not protest.
austen|They talked at first only of the performance.
dickens|A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy.
dickens|As he could hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice this was while my mind was so busy, he even at last began to doubt whether I was there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries, and rushed in, closely followed by the other two.
austen|It was all right, all open, all equal.
austen|By the bye, that is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece.
dickens|You have always held your place in my heart, I answered.
austen|But you observed nothing of course, for it seems to be a new idea to you.
dickens|I was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so.
dickens|The People is supreme.
dickens|Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them, until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with prisoners of both sexes.
austen|Bought at Weymouth, you knowMr Dixons choice.
austen|I like him very well.
dickens|Thank God, said Joe, Im ekerval to most.
dickens|And you, returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, are such a sensitive and poetical spirit  Come!
dickens|Halloa!
austen|Yesthe late Mr Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.
dickens|Mr Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room.
dickens|exclaimed Sydney.
austen|That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.
dickens|As I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so bitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name, that needed counteraction.
dickens|In the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began When the gentleman came on board  Do you mean the prisoner?
dickens|It opened from a stinking little black courtyard, and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited by a great number of people.
dickens|I tell thee, said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis, that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and coming.
dickens|In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable, Mr Lorry resolved to watch him attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so.
dickens|Her eyes were dilated and wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the words, My husband, my father, and my brother!
dickens|Wishing you were going to France at this time of day!
austen|She wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self, she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr and Mrs Westons disappointment, as might naturally belong to their friendship.
dickens|The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea.
dickens|Is it, pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious manner, the printed paper you have just been reading from?
dickens|The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined Jury, sat every day.
austen|she is absolutely charming!
austen|From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl.
austen|Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole.
dickens|My husband died of want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want.
dickens|Singular!
dickens|He wrote her a letter  Which she received, I struck in, when she was dressing for her marriage?
dickens|I lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to Joe.
austen|And is this all?
austen|Whether he were overhearing too, she could not determine.
austen|I have been here a week tomorrowhalf my time.
austen|The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.
dickens|Mind!
dickens|Ay!
austen|Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.
dickens|You may tell him so, with my compliments.
dickens|Then I tell you again, Mr Darnay, I am sorry for it.
dickens|To return to businessIs it not remarkable that Doctor Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is, should never touch upon that question?
austen|Change of scene might be of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.
dickens|I mustnt see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets; there mustnt be no mud on his boots.
dickens|But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and child must follow the husband and father.
dickens|When you go to Rome, do as Rome does.
austen|At present we have nothing to guide us.
austen|Good God!
dickens|My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less severely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames had set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse.
austen|Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.
dickens|There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much sympathy with her father.
austen|The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.
dickens|And six?
dickens|Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood, barefoot and barelegged, on the brown seasand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.
austen|We feel things differently.
dickens|Come here.
austen|We shall enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish.
austen|Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriets mind, producing reserve and selfcommand, it would.
dickens|You have a face to be remembered, and I remember faces well.
dickens|The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face.
dickens|Draw on these boots of mine.
dickens|I have been there, as you remember, said Darnay, with a smile, though reddening a little angrily, in another character, and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it.
austen|Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?
dickens|When he had done this, and had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on with what he was about.
austen|Nature gave you understandingMiss Taylor gave you principles.
dickens|There was an earnest womanly compassion for me in her new affection.
austen|Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder sister, or a truer friend?
austen|Emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light, cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection.
austen|Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.
dickens|You didnt mention your name, by the bye.
austen|She must have been a perpetual enemy.
austen|He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?
dickens|Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride was touched besides.
dickens|What is it in your hand?
dickens|I believe it.
dickens|Yes.
dickens|said the Doctor of Beauvais.
austen|Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!
dickens|I played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me.
dickens|demanded Mr Pocket.
austen|Poor girl!
austen|He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear.
austen|I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.
dickens|Only come to see me as if you come by chance alonger Wemmick.
dickens|The spy had kept his eyes open, but had been able to detect no sign.
dickens|Did that other creature come to the same end?
austen|Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery.
austen|Make haste, and come down this moment.
austen|Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?
dickens|softly over the coach roof.
dickens|If he had preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there, and which had been described to all the world.
dickens|Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for misdemeanor, while with Compeyson?
austen|A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern.
dickens|I couldnt keep my eyes off him.
dickens|Not that I have any occasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,as I told you at home the other night.
austen|They will soon be in Yorkshire.
dickens|I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day, by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.
austen|The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints.
dickens|I could make nothing of this, except that it was meant that I should make nothing of it, and I went home again in complete discomfiture.
dickens|Which is he?
austen|I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am.
dickens|For the sake of her child and her father, press upon her the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour.
austen|Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.
dickens|To which my conductor replied, Pumblechook.
dickens|Presently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he, Joe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.
dickens|On the third day of her being there, he noticed her.
dickens|I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the settle, and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder, I checked off again in detail his large head, his dark complexion, his deepset eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his large watchchain, his strong black dots of beard and whisker, and even the smell of scented soap on his great hand.
dickens|They were always My husband, my father, and my brother!
dickens|wasted, my childshould not be wasted, struck aside from the natural order of thingsfor my sake.
dickens|Very good, sir.
austen|And your defect is to hate everybody.
dickens|You dont know him, said the spy, quickly.
dickens|Is she not?
austen|Mr Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr Knightley, instead of being immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more chat.
austen|Goodbye.
austen|But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplationas a friend, indeed, you may command me.
dickens|the counting up to twelve, and Hush!
austen|I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse.
austen|No, upon no account in the world, Mr Weston; I am much obliged to you for reminding me.
dickens|What did you say?
dickens|No, miss, returned Jerry, it shall not be named to you.
dickens|It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr Lorry observed a great change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted there, had struck him a poisoned blow.
dickens|Ah!
austen|She comes to us today.
dickens|Strange that Creation, designed expressly for Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out!
austen|Oh!
austen|I fancy Mr E.
austen|Then, he said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.
austen|The expression of the eye is most correct, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes.
austen|And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude, of concurrence, of common kindness!
austen|Aye, very true, my dear, cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken a wordI was just going to say the same thing.
dickens|That warnt your name over the water.
austen|with the help of spectacles.
dickens|Some lawyer, maybe.
austen|It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.
dickens|The prisoner turned his face partly aside.
austen|Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.
austen|To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma.
dickens|Madame put her knife under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.
dickens|I found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.
austen|I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.
dickens|I cant guess what it is, maam.
dickens|But, keep in the way.
dickens|I sat gazing at him, spellbound.
austen|Oh!
dickens|My dread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy disadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious struggle in her bosom.
dickens|I was took up, took up, took up, to that extent that I reglarly growd up took up.
austen|Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.
austen|From Frank Churchills face, where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy with her shawl.
austen|Janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.
austen|The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness!
austen|Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr Bingley.
austen|Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.
austen|Mrs Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.
dickens|Under existing circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you are once in it.
austen|Prejudiced!
austen|There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what.
dickens|What is it, Pip?
austen|You are a good girl; he replied, and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.
dickens|So we slanted to the right where the East was, and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had to hold on tight to keep my seat.
austen|There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him.
dickens|Miss Manette, I am a man of business.
austen|It was quite a different sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent.
dickens|Who are you?
dickens|Whats on?
dickens|Is he there?
austen|The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.
austen|He had given it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have his thoughts to himself.
austen|Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astleys, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.
austen|The wedding over, and the bridepeople gone, her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening.
austen|I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma.
dickens|You know what I am, dont you?
austen|Oh!
dickens|In the mean time, Herbert and I were to consider separately what it would be best to say; whether we should devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious observation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should propose an expedition.
dickens|I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,I cannot hit upon the right name for the smartGod knows what its name was,that tears started to my eyes.
austen|There was no help for it, however.
dickens|I remember them very well.
dickens|He lies!
dickens|I looked again at those hands and eyes of the housekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over me when I last walkednot alonein the ruined garden, and through the deserted brewery.
dickens|What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!
austen|I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother.
dickens|The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom.
austen|You may imagine how desirable!
dickens|I think I should like to go home.
dickens|Now it was all coarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella see it on any account.
dickens|In those times a bed was always to be got there at any hour of the night, and the chamberlain, letting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle next in order on his shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his list.
dickens|Our chambers were in Gardencourt, down by the river.
austen|there he is.
dickens|Habitations, fences, domesticated animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore themall worn out.
austen|If any thing, you are too attentive.
dickens|Though she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.
dickens|At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly, and cried  Not that, sir!
austen|Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs Coles, turned to Frank Churchill.
dickens|Within, there were two glasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits.
dickens|The prisoner looked up, at each question.
dickens|The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old, and I took it up and ascended the staircase alone.
austen|Elizabeths collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.
austen|Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as loud as he could!
dickens|That, for weeks gone by, I had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like his.
dickens|Tomorrow is the first of June.
austen|Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr Bingley to her.
dickens|If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?
dickens|I thank you for the question.
dickens|Mr Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place, but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.
dickens|Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a Farewell.
austen|But that is not the case here.
austen|She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr and Mrs Weston; she was very often thinking of him, and quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, how were his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring.
austen|What will be his surprise, thought she, when he knows who they are?
austen|And as to my poor word success, which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it.
austen|Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.
dickens|I thought so too.
austen|I really could not help exclaiming!
dickens|Who else is there to inform?
austen|Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself.
austen|but he hoped he should in time.
dickens|No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I dont like it; I dont approve of it.
austen|With men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to please, every feature works.
dickens|I had gone direct to Mr Jaggers at his private house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and Mr Jaggers on the prisoners behalf would admit nothing.
dickens|And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch, said Mr Stryver.
austen|My dear Hill, have you heard the good news?
dickens|She had no fear of his striking at her with the knife, though they had.
dickens|See my saw!
dickens|Give him that.
dickens|It was the night afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth that I knowd on.
austen|We will follow them to Hartfield.
dickens|It may be all quite true, said I to Biddy, but I admire her dreadfully.
dickens|Was it you?
dickens|No.
austen|I do not know what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer.
austen|Things are settled so oddly.
dickens|A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated.
austen|I was snowed up at a friends house once for a week.
austen|She approached and saw the likeness of Mr Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece.
austen|Mr John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother.
dickens|Perhaps you know its Provis?
dickens|Many a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I lived happily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, and paid my debts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe.
austen|No, indeed you are mistaken.
dickens|Under the circumstances, no.
dickens|But when it came to that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as ifthe thought passed through my mindI were dying too.
austen|Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with her twice!
dickens|With these fears upon me, I began either to imagine or recall that I had had mysterious warnings of this mans approach.
austen|Mr Knightley!
austen|An excellent charade indeed!
austen|Some faults of temper John Knightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably.
austen|I never compliment.
austen|What a very great pleasure it will be to you!
dickens|Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had travelled thus far on his last way.
austen|Poor Jane!
austen|Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before himbut there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found, when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly threequarters of an hour.
dickens|A strange thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.
austen|Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of illfame.
dickens|Keep me down!
dickens|You brought no one with you?
austen|The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again.
dickens|The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule, time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all things ran their course.
austen|I do not get on at all.
dickens|That he had long irongray hair.
austen|But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.
austen|But Mr Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.
austen|Pray say no more.
austen|She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr Wickham, and rejoiced in it.
austen|I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr Collinss character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.
austen|Why should he have it more than anybody else?
austen|And when you get there, you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again; and you had better name an early hour.
dickens|said he.
dickens|Now, there you are hasty, sir, said Barsad, with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; there you really give me an advantage over you.
austen|Mr Elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in.
austen|Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?
dickens|Certain.
austen|On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said  Did you not think, Mr Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?
dickens|and called to Wemmick to give him that piece of paper.
austen|They are wanted in the farm, Mr Bennet, are they not?
austen|I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction!
austen|We will go to Hartfield afterwards.
dickens|Here is wine, said Mr Pumblechook.
dickens|He laid his hands upon my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper Avail yourself of this evening to lay hold of his portable property.
dickens|I get on.
austen|How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?
dickens|It yielded so suddenly at last, that he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite door, and we both laughed.
dickens|Never, if Saint Antoine knew his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs!
austen|Mr Elton is goodhumoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.
austen|He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging, following the lead of Miss Batess goodwill, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs Eltons praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being very pleasant and very elegantly dressed.
dickens|Which is he?
dickens|Without being sanguine as to my own part in those bright plans, I felt that Herberts way was clearing fast, and that old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum, and his daughter would soon be happily provided for.
austen|And Emma distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,I have been as good as my word.
dickens|Would it be J?
austen|Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened.
austen|Dear me!
dickens|I think so, Carton, by this time.
dickens|Call Estella.
austen|But Mr Weston is almost an old man.
dickens|I shall be more happy to execute it.
austen|Dear Mrs Weston!
dickens|Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and delicate, and difficult to penetrate.
dickens|It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me; that she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task had needed pains.
dickens|The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was all gone together.
dickens|As the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full, would not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find.
austen|She wanted to be alone.
dickens|answered Defarge, drily.
austen|Mr Elton, who might marry any body!
dickens|All well, Jacques.
dickens|At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire.
dickens|Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.
austen|I did for you.
dickens|Mr Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of tongue none of those outoftheway No Thoroughfares of Pork now, and took, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all.
dickens|I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir, he said to Wemmick.
dickens|Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face.
austen|You could not have visited me!
austen|For my companion tells me, said she, that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night, that I would come this morning.
austen|To be sureour discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong.
austen|I cannot help suspecting him.
dickens|It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door.
dickens|Think again.
dickens|It had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoners, and even died before him.
austen|Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.
dickens|I will be true to the death.
dickens|said I.
dickens|I cannot read what I have written with this gaunt hand.
dickens|I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter, he answered, a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor.
austen|I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.
dickens|I dont know, returned Biddy, smiling.
dickens|cried madame, pointing with her knife.
dickens|The Constables and the Bow Street men from Londonfor, this happened in the days of the extinct redwaistcoated policewere about the house for a week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like authorities doing in other such cases.
dickens|Pray, said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again, whose likenesses are those?
dickens|Its for you, Handel, said Herbert, going out and coming back with it, and I hope there is nothing the matter.
dickens|He had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking.
dickens|Fortified towns with their stockades, guardhouses, gates, trenches, and drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against this figure.
austen|said Emma, as she turned back into the hall again.
austen|I had quite determined to go away again.
dickens|Let me take your arm, Miss Pross.
austen|It was the first intimation of his being returned from London.
austen|How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy their imaginations all are!
austen|Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves!
austen|Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong?
austen|Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour.
dickens|Again among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty chaincables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for the moment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood and shaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under the figurehead of the John of Sunderland making a speech to the winds as is done by many Johns, and the Betsy of Yarmouth with a firm formality of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her head; in and out, hammers going in shipbuilders yards, saws going at timber, clashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leaky ships, capstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligible seacreatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen, in and out,out at last upon the clearer river, where the ships boys might take their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubled waters with them over the side, and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind.
austen|Mr Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.
dickens|Buuust me!
dickens|Because, said I, I began the service myself, more than two years ago, without his knowledge, and I dont want to be betrayed.
austen|You divert me against my conscience.
austen|No, said Emma, laughing; but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again.
austen|When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her excellence and patience, and my uncles generosity, I am mad with joy but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger.
austen|There is no understanding a word of it.
dickens|I would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back to Biddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, because my sense of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration.
austen|yes, perfectly.
dickens|O, good citizens, if you would have so much compassion for us!
austen|Yesif Darcy does not put it off again.
austen|The case, you see, isbut this is quite between ourselves I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room.
austen|Oh!
dickens|Convicts, sergeant?
dickens|And then I was recommended to the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought, and I took it.
dickens|A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been!
austen|Fairfax of the regiment of infantry, and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroadof his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwardsand this girl.
austen|Does he know his real character?
austen|All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.
austen|Howhow has it been possible?
dickens|asked Mr Wopsle, in a matterofcourse way.
dickens|No, my dear, not ill.
dickens|Throwing his finger at him again.
austen|I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.
austen|And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way!
dickens|I glanced at Herberts home, and at his character, and at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for; those, uncertain and unpunctual.
austen|Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.
dickens|He laid down the carvingknife and fork,being engaged in carving, at the moment,put his two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it.
dickens|The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general.
austen|Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.
austen|My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.
dickens|Others has done it safe afore, and what others has done afore, others can do agen.
dickens|Undoubtedly.
dickens|Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind, since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid women mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life from Tellsons side of the tides to the opposite shore.
dickens|A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.
dickens|Much surprised by the request, I took the note.
dickens|What is it, my Lucie?
dickens|Thats well.
austen|Yours ever,  CAROLINE BINGLEY  With the officers!
austen|I cannot see why Mrs Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia,  said she, Though I am not her particular friend.
austen|Elizabeth quietly answered Undoubtedly; and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.
austen|My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you.
dickens|I know him!
austen|Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.
austen|You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone.
austen|And I have not forgotten, said Emma, how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would.
dickens|respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never sawso long dead  Mr Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids.
dickens|I shall never feel her weight.
austen|Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?
dickens|Miss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that passage across the Channel?
dickens|This was when we were left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his story.
austen|Mrs Dixon, I understand, has no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be compared with Miss Fairfax.
dickens|You think there never might have been a Mrs Lorry?
dickens|A matter of business.
austen|said he, I can fasten the rivet.
austen|I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.
dickens|I know it from her own lips.
dickens|I went down early in the morning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the forge.
austen|Are you talking about me?
dickens|How do they call you?
austen|If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too.
austen|And how impossible in others!
dickens|If you have, dont expect me to keep your secret.
austen|Happily, it was now time to be gone.
dickens|Is it a very wicked place?
dickens|If you know it, it is enough.
dickens|What odds, dear boy?
austen|How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!
dickens|But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this.
austen|Darcy smiled and said, You are perfectly right.
dickens|The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were pulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the blind towards the east come down.
dickens|Listen, everywhere!
austen|That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certainbut I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.
austen|A little tea if you please, sir, by and bye,no hurryOh!
dickens|His breathing was a little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.
austen|His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself.
austen|She should then have heard more Mrs Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed, would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge.
austen|I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged.
dickens|One Hundred and Five, North Tower.
dickens|Whether he knew what had happened, whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved.
dickens|Yet like a foreigner, I thought?
dickens|When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded.
dickens|While I did so, he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when I saw him thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again.
dickens|But, such awful workers, and such awful work!
dickens|I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.
austen|He had his shepherds son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.
dickens|For, people then paid to see the play at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlamonly the former entertainment was much the dearer.
dickens|Jerry added, by way of proviso.
austen|Where is your sister?
dickens|I was new here once, said Mr Wemmick.
austen|the best nature in the worlda wedding.
dickens|Guess.
dickens|On this last evening, I dressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my splendor until bedtime.
dickens|Still, I knew that there was cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being watched.
austen|He would not deny that he did, she was sure.
dickens|, and its contents were simply, that I was an honored sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs J.
dickens|Mr Pumblechook and Mrs Joe stared at one another again, in utter amazement.
dickens|That there could be no such beauty without it.
austen|What, none of you?
dickens|You never do complain.
dickens|Youre on your oath, you know, Pips comrade?
austen|he continued; every day more precious and more delightful than the day before!
dickens|Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?
austen|But at length, by Elizabeths persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.
austen|A carriage was heard.
dickens|As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.
dickens|So fur as I could find, there warnt a soul that see young Abel Magwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at him, and either drove him off, or took him up.
dickens|You shall have some eggs, and judge for yourself.
austen|I thank you for explaining it so fully.
austen|Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior toYou shall try it some day.
austen|Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr Collins first came to Hunsford.
dickens|He had worn all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.
dickens|Saint Antoines blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was downdown on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the governors body laydown on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation.
dickens|He stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in a bullying, interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr Wopsle,as it were to mark him outbefore biting it again.
dickens|How long, dear Joe?
austen|Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.
dickens|Id have spent em on a Man, in wittles and drink.
austen|She was in gay spirits, and would have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her but his gaiety did not meet hers.
austen|Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.
austen|Could he be a sensible man, sir?
dickens|We have been counting on your return these three or four days past.
austen|I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again.
dickens|And when she diedI believe brokenheartedhaving never slackened her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.
dickens|said Joe.
dickens|I knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her.
dickens|said Mr Cruncher, more and more disturbed.
austen|The heat even would be danger.
dickens|Now, master!
dickens|Mr Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of emptyheaded girls; you must not expect to do it, or you will always be disappointed.
dickens|Still watching me, he laid them one upon the other, folded them longwise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and dropped the ashes into the tray.
austen|I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you.
dickens|Yes, Pip, dear boy, Ive made a gentleman on you!
austen|But he was set right there by Mrs Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.
dickens|Heres old Bill Barley, bless your eyes.
dickens|O my dear, my dear, will you bless me as fervently tomorrow?
dickens|He set down his glass untouched.
austen|Lizzy, cried her mother, remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.
austen|no; cautious as a minister of state.
austen|She read the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness.
dickens|But it may be true.
austen|Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr Weston, must necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement.
dickens|But I thinkI knowhe does.
dickens|How irrevocable would have been his knowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!
austen|I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy, said Mr Knightley presently, though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet.
dickens|He was buried in London, at the church of Saint PancrasintheFields.
dickens|The wretched man trifled with his glass,took it up, looked at it through the light, put it down,prolonged my misery.
dickens|The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away.
austen|It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment.
dickens|His mind was so full of the others, that he never once thought of him.
dickens|The few words that he caught from this mans lips, first made it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris.
dickens|It would not enable Her to go to see him.
dickens|We have been to your residence, said the first, and not being so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of overtaking you.
dickens|Heres a J and a O, Pip, and a JO, Joe.
dickens|It was not for his dignity to notice it; his contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word Go on!
austen|The naivete of Miss Smiths mannersand altogetherOh, it is most admirable!
dickens|It comes surely, said Carton.
austen|Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune.
austen|Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father, engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown.
dickens|Exactly what I myself had thought, many times.
dickens|Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder of a horse at Tellsons door, who made off with it, was put to Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of threefourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to Death.
dickens|You thought!
dickens|said he.
dickens|A bad un, Ill be bound, said Mrs Joe triumphantly, or he wouldnt have given it to the boy!
dickens|How many did they say?
dickens|I looked all round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of him.
austen|A great many indeed, said her companion with a sigh.
dickens|Not to say an unfeeling thing, said I, he cannot do better than go.
dickens|He seemed to have no strength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked down; but he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or drinking out of the waterbottle, with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an air and a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at last.
austen|She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits.
dickens|Probably, it took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in various stages of decay.
dickens|But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it.
austen|She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhoodand sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half.
dickens|No.
dickens|I have got a stewed steak,which is of home preparation,and a cold roast fowl,which is from the cooksshop.
dickens|He shook his head.
dickens|Good again!
austen|Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure.
dickens|And Mr Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy, because, after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes fixed on the fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.
austen|He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I thought her too young in short, whether I approved his choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered especially since your making so much of her as in a line of society above him.
dickens|Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight; then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.
dickens|I hope to hear you say so, my dear boy.
austen|He is as well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriets.
dickens|And lookee here!
dickens|When he asked what should such fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged with loud cries of Hear, hear!
austen|But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.
dickens|Your acceptance of it, and your observance of it as binding, is the only remaining condition that I am charged with, by the person from whom I take my instructions, and for whom I am not otherwise responsible.
dickens|At that timeI may ask, at what time, sir?
dickens|asked Estella of myself, with the greatest disdain.
dickens|I always am sound; am I not?
dickens|A craven who abandoned his post, said anotherthis Monseigneur had been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated, in a load of haysome years ago.
dickens|That I knew better.
dickens|It had evidently been a great distress to him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled.
dickens|We went in, Wemmick leaving his fishingrod in the porch, and looked all round.
dickens|When the newlymarried pair came home, the first person who appeared, to offer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton.
dickens|Are you very unhappy now?
austen|You may guess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I made my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once.
dickens|And his watch is a gold repeater, and worth a hundred pound if its worth a penny.
dickens|He said no.
dickens|Waldengarver?
dickens|Lucie!
dickens|Which is it to be?
dickens|As to our lodging, its not by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my father hasnt anything to give me, and I shouldnt be willing to take it, if he had.
dickens|Yes, maam.
dickens|Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me.
dickens|Did you observe, gentlemen, said Mr Waldengarver, that there was a man in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service,I mean, the representation?
austen|She did not suspect him.
austen|Mr Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
dickens|The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.
austen|How could you begin?
austen|I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.
dickens|That young man hears the words I speak.
dickens|Having settled to do this, we returned into the house and went to bed.
austen|Does Mrs Churchill do the same?
austen|When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve.
austen|This is not to be borne.
dickens|That is the man, said Mr Jaggers, in New South Wales.
dickens|When it was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself in her usual work, nor had she read to him.
dickens|His manner and his look quite terrified them all.
austen|I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.
austen|His wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed.
dickens|By then making a loop of about a couple of miles into the open country at the back of Pumblechooks premises, I got round into the High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and felt myself in comparative security.
austen|But did you never see him?
dickens|But Herberts was a very different case, and it often caused me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in crowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work, and placing the Canarybreasted Avenger at his disposal.
dickens|And is that your father alonger your mother?
austen|Ah!
austen|Oh!
dickens|The stranger did not recognize me, but I recognized him as the gentleman I had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit to Miss Havisham.
dickens|A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques.
dickens|Enough of this parley, said the sergeant.
dickens|He forced back the gathering shadows of death, as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his wound.
austen|I had no right to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish, so totally without air.
dickens|Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat, I explained, trembling; andandI was very anxious to put this delicatelyand withthe same reason for wanting to borrow a file.
austen|And upon Elizabeths seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr Collins.
austen|If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we should deem it;and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view or his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he can;here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another mans house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again tomorrow.
dickens|He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger.
austen|They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!
austen|The envelope itself was likewise full.
austen|As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day, a note was brought from Mrs Goddard, requesting, in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most welcome request for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her beauty.
austen|Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.
dickens|Mrs Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself.
dickens|If he had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have resolved it; but he was by that time clearheaded, and had none.
dickens|From the dimlylighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr Lorry, the solicitor for the defence, and its counsel, Mr Stryver, stood gathered round Mr Charles Darnayjust releasedcongratulating him on his escape from death.
dickens|You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?
dickens|Ahoy!
dickens|I have seen them.
dickens|I asked him how long he had left Gargerys forge?
dickens|I got up from the meal, saying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me, Well!
dickens|Several close their eyes, and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together.
dickens|I will do nothing for you.
austen|There will not be time for any thing.
austen|She could never quit him.
dickens|said Joe, in a very decided manner.
austen|said he, I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind excessively.
dickens|I got a dreadful start, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a sheepbell.
austen|She is as low as possible.
austen|The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.
austen|Ah!
dickens|If you remember, said Carton, dictating, the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it.
austen|And there are other circumstances which I am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.
austen|She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.
austen|You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.
austen|Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.
austen|This was agreed to, and Mrs Phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.
austen|She was not obliged to hear.
dickens|He was now a very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength of resolution, and vigour of action.
dickens|But then, Mr Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,  Gentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?
dickens|I asked.
dickens|Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?
dickens|I dined, myself, while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong tothis, or some other.
austen|And when he was gone, she almost quarrelled with meNo, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left.
austen|The rest of the evening passed with the appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.
austen|I was a kinder friend than you deserved.
austen|I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.
dickens|But, now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that they have no part in His mercies.
dickens|Shes got the shroud again.
austen|The best fruit in Englandevery bodys favouritealways wholesome.
dickens|Positively laughing!
austen|What could be more natural than his asking you again?
dickens|And never see her again, though she is so pretty?
austen|Elizabeth was now to see Mr Wickham for the last time.
austen|They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.
austen|She believed every body spoke well of him.
austen|Such a change!
austen|And I begged Mrs Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.
austen|She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.
dickens|So it always was.
dickens|A warmint, dear boy.
austen|Let me write for you, said Jane, if you dislike the trouble yourself.
dickens|But Estella is a different case, and if you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a part of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do that than to bemoan the past through a hundred years.
dickens|I cant say.
dickens|And by one other.
dickens|We had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and then walked in the fields.
austen|She loves piquet, you know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your usual timeand the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort.
dickens|I think not.
dickens|demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there were another enemy strangled.
austen|Are you in any doubt as to that?
austen|Emmas project of forgetting Mr Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close to her.
austen|Mr Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was.
austen|Yes, very true.
dickens|said I.
dickens|We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.
austen|She had never been quite well since the time of their daughters marriage; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort.
dickens|Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the same by their religion.
dickens|?
dickens|Correcting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him for his mention of Mr Matthew Pocket  Thats more like it!
dickens|Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke.
dickens|The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent.
dickens|Dont be ungrateful.
dickens|pursued my convict.
dickens|He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.
dickens|Probably every new and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell a trifle short of the wearers expectation.
dickens|Pretty well?
dickens|Speak for yourself, Mr Lorry, said Stryver; I have a nights work to do yet.
dickens|Which he warnt strong enough, my dear, fur to be surprised, said Joe.
austen|Mine, I confess, are exhausted.
austen|I will only add, God bless you.
austen|Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend.
dickens|Why you see, old chap, said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by way of getting at it by degrees, I wouldnt go so far as to say that, for thats a deal to say; but she aint  Living, Joe?
austen|When Mr Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.
dickens|Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?
austen|You are trying not to smile.
dickens|Let her alone, will you?
dickens|There they are, said Herbert, coming out of the Tap.
austen|He had reached Randalls the evening before.
dickens|Call yourself a religious woman?
dickens|Show me the North Tower!
dickens|So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his hand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the birdsnest.
dickens|The passenger booked by this history, was on the coachstep, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow.
austen|Emma felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring the baby,  What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.
austen|My plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.
dickens|In the excited and exalted state of my brain, I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons without seeing them.
dickens|If you cant get to be oncommon through going straight, youll never get to do it through going crooked.
austen|There had been no real affection either in his language or manners.
austen|The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.
austen|Mr Woodhouse could never allow for Mr Knightleys claims on his brother, or any bodys claims on Isabella, except his own.
dickens|Put the case that this was done, and that the woman was cleared.
dickens|I had no grain of hope left.
dickens|I will say, informed, Mr Jaggers.
austen|It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious, which she did not wish.
dickens|Do you know it, or dont you know it?
dickens|Then why the devil dont you dine?
dickens|It was right to do it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would do it again.
dickens|Never.
austen|I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not.
dickens|Very well, then, said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome light, I have never left off adoring her.
austen|Mr Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.
austen|She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.
austen|I never should have presumed to think of it at first, said she, but for you.
dickens|It could not be otherwise, said the prisoner.
dickens|I mean to tell you, Mr Stryver, said Mr Lorry, reddening, that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips; and that if I knew any manwhich I hope I do notwhose taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk, not even Tellsons should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind.
dickens|A pleasures a pleasure all the world over.
dickens|Because, lookee here, dear boy, he said, dropping his voice, and laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, caution is necessary.
austen|Well, said she at last, trying to recover herself; this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at all comprehend it.
austen|And Mr Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better.
dickens|And what do you suppose, you conceited female, said Mr Cruncher, with unconscious inconsistency, that the worth of your prayers may be?
dickens|As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fiftytwo were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him, as having a knowledge of him.
austen|He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud.
austen|Oh!
dickens|Truly yes, madame.
austen|She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark.
dickens|Pitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled down upon the pie, I made bold to say, I am glad you enjoy it.
austen|Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.
dickens|I thought what a blessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.
austen|Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.
dickens|So, Mr Trabb measured and calculated me in the parlor, as if I were an estate and he the finest species of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that I felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his pains.
dickens|A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, uphill thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.
austen|Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.
dickens|Try a tenderer bit.
austen|After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.
austen|He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylors merits, without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouses character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylors.
dickens|Mr Camilla interposing, as Mrs Camilla laid her hand upon her heaving bosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of view, and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth.
dickens|Help, help, help!
austen|But for Harriets sake, or rather for my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present, I will break my resolution now.
austen|Now, here will be Mr Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such very good people; and the PerrysI suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr and Mrs Perry.
austen|She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties.
dickens|But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a girl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself or anybody else about her family!
dickens|Mr Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight oclock in the parlor behind the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises.
austen|You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to AbbeyMill.
dickens|The allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain in my arm.
dickens|You remember?
austen|The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration.
austen|The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr Elton.
austen|This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley today.
austen|I am ready, if the others are.
austen|I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr Darcy.
austen|The young mans conduct, and his sisters, seemed the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them.
austen|There is no end of peoples coming to him, on some pretence or other.
austen|They had reached the house.
austen|In short, I will do my best.
dickens|A good opportunity for consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself.
austen|He was always agreeable and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body.
dickens|Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table.
dickens|Every towngate and village taxinghouse had its band of citizenpatriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, crossquestioned them, inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own, turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.
austen|Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying.
austen|Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.
austen|Mr Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill.
austen|I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder.
austen|Weston and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.
dickens|They both led tramping lives, and this woman in Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick as we say, to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy.
austen|They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.
dickens|I make a great difference between you and all other people when I say so much.
austen|yes;there is nothing in that.
austen|Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to.
dickens|We changed, and I had not made up my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to get down and walk back, when we changed again.
austen|My friend Knightley had been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend.
dickens|said Mr Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots and then straightening himself.
austen|Compare Mr Martin with either of them.
austen|Dont ask me.
dickens|At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present himself in Mr Lorrys room again, where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety.
dickens|You had a particular fancy for me, hadnt you, Old Artful?
dickens|My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became much more remarkable.
austen|We will not be severe.
dickens|And if youve got holsters to that saddle o yourn, dont let me see your hand go nigh em.
dickens|It was so like Smiths work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leapfrog might have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.
dickens|I asked him where we should come to for I had no idea where he lived, and I believe it was in his general objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied, Come here, and Ill take you home with me.
austen|Mr Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence, and when, immediately before my fathers death, Mr Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him, as of his affection to myself.
dickens|However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not doubt the accuracy of the interpretation.
dickens|A bell with an old voicewhich I dare say in its time had often said to the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamondhilted sword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitairesounded gravely in the moonlight, and two cherrycolored maids came fluttering out to receive Estella.
dickens|Still, the reference to Provis by name mastered everything.
dickens|Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had taken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion, and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and infamous, and shameful, and I dont know what else.
dickens|Not that he ever said anything, or did anything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that he always beat his sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old Clem, he came in out of time.
dickens|She said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she meant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of lovedespairrevengedire deathit could not have sounded from her lips more like a curse.
austen|Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though the father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remainedin the law linenothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him, than that he was in the law line; and with him the daughter had lived.
austen|She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mindin what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him.
dickens|You know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with the family.
austen|How should you have liked making sermons?
dickens|It was the settled manner of a tired man, who had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into his road and saw its end.
dickens|But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in, and presently brought the sharp message that I was to come up.
dickens|I looked at him eagerly when he looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head.
dickens|I heard the fall of the axe in that sound.
austen|Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him.
austen|the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!
dickens|The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all eyes, ears, and spikes.
dickens|A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question.
dickens|I asked her to give me some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gave me all she possessed.
dickens|And what would have been your destination?
austen|You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury.
austen|Mr Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sisters, Mr Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.
austen|Nothing to signify.
austen|Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.
dickens|Help the gentleman to take her out.
austen|Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?
dickens|As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barleys sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door opened, and a very pretty, slight, darkeyed girl of twenty or so came in with a basket in her hand whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the basket, and presented, blushing, as Clara.
dickens|When the church came to itself,for he was so sudden and strong that he made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my feet,when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high tombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.
dickens|Do dozens come for that purpose?
dickens|Longsuffering and loving Joe, you never complain.
austen|I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermonmaking was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly.
dickens|After a time, I tried in the dark both to get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands.
dickens|The shadow of a large highroofed house, and of many overhanging trees, was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and the great door of his chateau was opened to him.
dickens|Business, business!
dickens|We have been so full of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way to turn.
dickens|Have you time to spare?
austen|Every thing declared it; his own attentions, his fathers hints, his motherinlaws guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story.
dickens|Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after as a great match.
austen|Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.
austen|They are blended, said he, I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous, I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good.
austen|Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.
dickens|Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me.
austen|He is perfectly amiable.
austen|Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort.
dickens|When she had laid the suppercloth, the bridge was lowered to give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night.
austen|Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane.
austen|You are fatigued already.
austen|Supper was announced.
austen|When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax, you will understand that Mr Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury, both in person and mind.
dickens|The change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of Monseigneur.
dickens|He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in his work.
dickens|Joe was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth face, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with their own whites.
dickens|If youre not tired, Mr Pipthough I know its tiring to strangerswill you tip him one more?
dickens|An ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount of the postingyard, and many voices called out loudly, Down with the emigrant!
austen|Mr Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.
dickens|His practised eye saw it, and made the most of it.
austen|She was so surprized she did not know what to do.
dickens|Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in any way sumever!
austen|She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.
austen|Oh!
austen|I do not want the matchI do not want to injure dear little Henrybut the idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr Knightley really wished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henrys account, a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?
austen|Now there would be pleasure in her returningEvery thing would be a pleasure.
dickens|I was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said to myself, Pip, what a fool you are!
austen|It is from my cousin, Mr Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.
dickens|I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness, that I must abridge this narrative.
austen|As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.
dickens|Miss Havisham, said I, I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to Estella; and finding that some wind had blown her here, I followed.
dickens|I think you may take that liberty, the Doctor answered, smiling.
dickens|Among us!
austen|Does that young lady know Mr Darcy?
dickens|Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes.
dickens|Our plan was this.
dickens|How could I do otherwise!
dickens|Spies!
austen|She has been so kind as to promise it.
dickens|Show me!
dickens|cried Mr Lorry.
dickens|I am well, and your father has       influence around me.
austen|Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.
dickens|He was ailing at that time, poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and comfort him in our cottageour doghut, as that man would call it.
dickens|The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would start from London at about nine on Thursday morning.
dickens|Take the baby, Mum, and give me your book.
dickens|I wondered how many other clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellowcreatures.
dickens|I dont know how scarce you maynt make the wittles and drink here, by your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct.
austen|My temper would perhaps be called resentful.
dickens|If there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be content with those I had.
dickens|Give it mouth!
dickens|And you get me wittles.
dickens|Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught.
dickens|About midnight I got out of bed and went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for fourandtwenty hours, and that Wednesday was past.
austen|She would have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life.
dickens|Howsomever, Im a getting low, and I know whats due.
dickens|Pray, said Mr Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble pray control your agitationa matter of business.
austen|And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls, because of his daughters being housemaid there.
austen|Well, any friend of Mr Bingleys will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.
dickens|Your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two.
austen|Cannot you, my dear Emmacannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear?
austen|Too much, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise?
dickens|There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of these words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text, when he said here we were at Barnards Inn.
dickens|Thank God!
austen|You are uniformly charming!
dickens|Then Mr Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks.
dickens|You see?
austen|Now I say, my dear, in our case, for lady, readmum!
dickens|Going a fishing.
austen|To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.
austen|But from one cause or another, I gave it up in disgust.
austen|It was her superior duty.
dickens|Master Cruncher who was in his shirt took this very ill, and, turning to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal board.
austen|Oh!
austen|Well, Miss Woodhouse!
austen|Mr Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc.
dickens|Would there be any objection to my taking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?
dickens|there are many kinds of pride, said Biddy, looking full at me and shaking her head; pride is not all of one kind  Well?
austen|Poor child!
austen|Ah, my dear, said he, poor Miss TaylorIt is a grievous business.
austen|Let me hear what it is.
dickens|Where will you be safe?
austen|He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.
dickens|Wemmick appeared, handed it in, and disappeared.
dickens|I have no hope that I shall ever call you mine, Estella.
dickens|said Mr Jaggers.
austen|So much superadded decision of character!
dickens|What?
austen|His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated; Mrs Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.
austen|You will soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself.
dickens|What then?
dickens|I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many efforts, the dose that I desired to give.
austen|We have not determined how far it shall carry us, said Mrs Gardiner, but, perhaps, to the Lakes.
austen|I know it to be impossible.
austen|Mrs Churchills state, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependenceand Mrs Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be by some attack of Mrs Churchill that he was prevented coming.
austen|I am amused by one part of Johns letterdid you notice it?
austen|Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.
austen|You must be surprised, very much surprisedso lately as Mr Collins was wishing to marry you.
austen|Selina would stare when she heard of it.
austen|Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology, Hunsford, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
austen|Emma returned her friends pressure with interest; and was pleased enough to exclaim,  You are not vain, Mr Knightley.
dickens|says a man behind him.
austen|I am sure my sisters must all envy me.
dickens|A fire had been lately kindled in the damp oldfashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than to burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder than the clearer air,like our own marsh mist.
austen|He had never been in the room at the Crown in his lifedid not know the people who kept it by sight.
austen|There is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet.
dickens|If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, Id recommend you to do it,  said Joe, all aghast.
dickens|There we found, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat clean, cheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.
austen|Unfortunately an only son for many years an only child, I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable, allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.
dickens|How say you, Jacques?
dickens|His way taking him past Tellsons, and he both banking at Tellsons and knowing Mr Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr Stryvers mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr Lorry the brightness of the Soho horizon.
dickens|And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.
austen|Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, Sir Williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.
austen|They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcys father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring.
austen|Has Emma read it all?
austen|such smoothness!
dickens|where is that Accursed?
dickens|Well!
dickens|Saying your prayers!
dickens|Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoners mind.
dickens|Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did, in time to check herself and go back.
austen|Mr Knightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr Elton.
austen|But I never have.
dickens|Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.
dickens|The abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, the repugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been exceeded if he had been some terrible beast.
austen|You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.
dickens|said Mr Lorry.
dickens|It was full of people; the whole village was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there was Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst of the kitchen.
dickens|Well, Pip?
austen|You have a very small park here, returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.
dickens|I also went to the coachoffice and took my place for seven oclock on Saturday morning.
dickens|Do you remember the sex of the child?
dickens|First, I resumed, half groaning, what precautions can be taken against your being recognized and seized?
dickens|As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the door, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity that was of its kind quite dreadful.
austen|Where is it?
austen|Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.
dickens|Never seen it, said Wemmick.
austen|In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure, said Bingley; and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.
dickens|Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his net,to be prosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.
austen|An injunction of secresy had been among Mr Westons parting words.
austen|These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything.
austen|You made a lucky guess; and that is all that can be said.
dickens|After a silence of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed their conversation.
dickens|returned Wemmick.
dickens|I must act for myself, therefore.
dickens|You see me, citizen!
austen|She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to be put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between espalier appletrees to the front door, the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour.
austen|I often think, said she, that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends.
austen|In revolving Lady Catherines expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.
austen|Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.
dickens|Father, said Young Jerry, as they walked along taking care to keep at arms length and to have the stool well between them whats a ResurrectionMan?
dickens|I saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps.
dickens|I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence.
dickens|I belong to Tellsons Bank.
austen|said Mrs Bennet, shaking her head, then she is better off than many girls.
austen|Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.
dickens|and if anybody made an admission, he said, Now I have got you!
austen|Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care.
dickens|They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away.
dickens|said I.
dickens|I am in my seventyeighth year.
austen|Poor little Lizzy!
dickens|Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the ground.
austen|I have been used to hear hers admired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play wella man, a very musical man, and in love with another womanengaged to heron the point of marriagewould yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down insteadnever seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other.
dickens|said one of the oldest of clerks to Jerry the messenger.
austen|When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.
austen|I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the first circle.
austen|She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just nothing at all.
austen|My uncle!
austen|After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.
austen|The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered.
dickens|Now, Mr Pip, said Mr Jaggers, attend, if you please.
austen|Good gracious!
austen|He made no answer.
dickens|As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel of oysters to Joe as reparation for not having gone myself, and then went on to Barnards Inn.
dickens|The prisoners.
dickens|The Aged especially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage tribe, just oiled.
dickens|Forbid it, proceeded Mr Cruncher, with additional solemnity, additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out, as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now!
dickens|Perhaps I know more of Estellas history than even you do, said I.
dickens|If it had not been Charles, it would have been another.
dickens|Mr Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm.
dickens|Is he going to make it manslaughter, or whats he going to make of it?
austen|She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place.
austen|Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.
austen|Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves.
dickens|One thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief came, neither of us could relinquish the fire.
austen|Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet steady voice,  How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!
dickens|Indeed!
dickens|Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure, ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing.
dickens|Put him aside, Monsieur Gabelle!
austen|how I wanted you!
dickens|Yes!
dickens|But I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran headforemost into a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to me, saying, Here you are, look sharp, come on!
dickens|O no, no, no, I returned, Never, never!
austen|I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove.
austen|In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.
austen|You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.
dickens|Patience, my dear Handel time enough, time enough.
austen|No really, replied Elizabeth; I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.
dickens|Then he delivered to the escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him to dismount.
austen|Ten thousand a year!
austen|If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness indeed!
austen|And here I can admit, that my manners to Miss W.
austen|Rendered spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brotherinlaws entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.
austen|Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment.
dickens|This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and would have sent her compliments, when the nurse came to my rescue.
dickens|Why, to be sure!
dickens|My child, said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her shoulder, I have saved him.
dickens|There were other times when she would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me.
austen|Harriets parentage became known.
dickens|It came through Provis, I replied.
dickens|He broke the awkward silence by saying  This is something new to me, Mr Lorry.
dickens|On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade, was extensive standingfor carriageswhere, indeed, some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood.
dickens|My eye had been caught by a gun with a brassbound stock over the chimneypiece, and his eye had followed mine.
dickens|and then I kissed my sister who was laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed Biddy, and threw my arms around Joes neck.
austen|If one leads you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it.
dickens|Afterwards, Estella and I played at cards, as of yore,only we were skilful now, and played French games,and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.
dickens|I couldnt undertake to say that, of my own knowledge.
austen|It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.
dickens|You must comply with ittake off those boots you wear, and draw on these of mine.
dickens|It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his.
austen|I know them a little.
dickens|Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy smear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we came up with him,  Mr Pip and friend?
dickens|He calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!
dickens|As it is, time must be lost.
austen|said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of hearingHow well they suit one another!
dickens|Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his waytend to his own power and pocket.
austen|I did not know before, continued Bingley immediately, that you were a studier of character.
dickens|It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.
dickens|Her father had to do with the victualling of passengerships.
dickens|Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his servant to ride and drive as well.
dickens|The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring.
dickens|At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co.
dickens|Well!
dickens|Ever been in prison?
austen|Only think of our happening to meet him!
austen|Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is.
austen|She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.
dickens|Here I am.
dickens|I think so.
dickens|Very willingly, said the mender of roads.
austen|I do not think he is conceited either, in general, said Harriet, her conscience opposing such censure; at least, he is very good natured, and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard forbut that is quite a different thing fromand you know, though he may like me, it does not follow that I shouldand certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen peopleand if one comes to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all, one is so very handsome and agreeable.
dickens|Mr Barsad is the best authority possible, sir, said Sydney, and I have it from Mr Barsads communication to a friend and brother Sheep over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place.
dickens|How did she murder?
dickens|The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that same hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.
austen|Impossible!
austen|His sufferings, replied Emma dryly, do not appear to have done him much harm.
dickens|Let them bring another.
dickens|I believe, returned Doctor Manette, that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady.
austen|He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton.
austen|His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased.
austen|His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.
austen|Alas!
austen|And that excellent Miss Bates!
austen|No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she lovedand the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.
dickens|Bring this with you.
austen|Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of.
austen|I depend on you for that.
dickens|On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr Jarvis Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived, on his way to dine with the Doctor.
austen|Of course, he must be sorry to lose herthey must be all sorry.
austen|Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?
austen|If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.
dickens|What a fortune for the son of my mother!
austen|Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of selfconsequence but herself?
austen|Jane Fairfax has feeling, said Mr KnightleyI do not accuse her of want of feeling.
austen|But it is of small importance.
austen|After a little more discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say, with an air of grave reflection,  It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here.
dickens|Mr Cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.
austen|As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.
dickens|How are you living?
dickens|There!
austen|As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olivebranch.
austen|They all seemed to remember the day, the hour, the party, the occasionto feel the same consciousness, the same regretsto be ready to return to the same good understanding; and they were just growing again like themselves, Harriet, as Emma must suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy, when the carriage reappeared, and all was over.
dickens|But he insisted on walking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation for him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and of course had his hands to wash.
austen|She is not entirely without it, I think.
austen|Oh!
dickens|The moment he ceased, she looked at him again.
dickens|As I serve my gun that day, I resolve, when the place shall fall, to examine that cell.
dickens|In arranging his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the prisoners pockets, over and over again.
dickens|I will go to her.
dickens|I ascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old way at the door of Miss Havishams room.
dickens|It was not alluded to in any way, and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises.
austen|sirbut a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a windowcurtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected.
austen|There are secrets in all families, you knowThe case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Franks coming depends upon their being put off.
dickens|And who among the company at Monseigneurs reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman, powdered, goldlaced, pumped, and whitesilk stockinged, would see the very stars out!
dickens|Miss A.
dickens|Antoine.
dickens|﻿  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
austen|noI hope I shall not be ridiculous about it.
austen|Small heart had Harriet for visiting.
austen|I would rather walk.
dickens|Any foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do.
dickens|Barsad, repeated madame.
austen|With all my heart.
dickens|But, perhaps, nobodys ever did?
dickens|A vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Companys House.
dickens|said I, with great anxiety.
dickens|feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and contrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance.
austen|He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma.
dickens|Go!
austen|But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any body, that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her.
dickens|Never in a debtors prison?
dickens|I dont hear it.
austen|and so did Mrs Forster.
dickens|These words had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice.
dickens|It was very dark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along.
austen|I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper.
austen|Thats true, she criedvery true.
dickens|Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before, and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making a grand clearance among Mr Stryvers papers before the setting in of the long vacation.
dickens|Dont revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.
austen|It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour.
dickens|Then what you have to do, is, to remain there until he wants you.
austen|So far as that it relates to Mr Frank Churchill, I do guess.
dickens|Leave us, good boys; we have business here.
dickens|What did I tell you then, Pip?
austen|Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.
austen|I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.
dickens|You should think!
austen|But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride?
dickens|He expressed no alarm, and seemed to feel none that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he was softened,indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could never afterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.
dickens|This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wineshop of Monsieur Defarge.
austen|There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men.
dickens|I asked him in a whisper.
dickens|Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.
austen|I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,  said Mr Weston.
austen|Oh!
dickens|What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still thinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so much support, is thisIf the Republic really does good to the poor, and they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may live a long time she may even live to be old.
austen|And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.
austen|She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there was too much ease.
austen|Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.
dickens|I am going, said Mr Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the desk whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to be not half desk enough for him I am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr Lorry.
austen|I hate such false friends.
austen|When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?
austen|Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.
austen|He knew of no one but Mrs Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends.
dickens|and so, by degrees, became conversational and able to walk away.
austen|You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage.
austen|Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and make me comfortable again.
dickens|He could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for himself and for them.
austen|Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him tonight.
dickens|I was with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such places.
austen|Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable!
austen|Mr Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it should make Mr Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his hurrying away.
dickens|Tar!
austen|They must keep as much together as they could; and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage.
dickens|It were understood, said Joe.
dickens|This contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do them good with her.
dickens|A narrow winding street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill.
austen|Very well; I will not plague you any more.
dickens|He was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me, by seeing Provis.
austen|And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.
dickens|She could scarcely answer, I trust in you.
dickens|I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations had any legacies?
dickens|And what wind, said Miss Havisham, blows you here, Pip?
dickens|She is a lady and very beautiful.
dickens|Good stuff, eh, sergeant?
austen|But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.
austen|I only name possibilities.
dickens|Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of having deserved well of his fellowcreatures, said,quite vivaciously, all things considered,Well, Mrs Joe, well do our best endeavors; let us have a cut at this same pie.
austen|I have seen them both  Then it is as I always hoped, cried Jane; they are married!
austen|Mrs Bennet said only, Nonsense, nonsense!
dickens|Oh!
dickens|So convinced I was of that womans being her mother, that I wanted no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind.
dickens|I will do, Defarge doggedly rejoined, nothing for you.
austen|The evil day was put off.
austen|say beautiful rather.
austen|Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.
dickens|The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand, as Mr AttorneyGeneral rose to spin the rope, grind the axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.
dickens|I was not long after him in leaving the house too, and when I went down the High Street I saw him holding forth no doubt to the same effect at his shop door to a select group, who honored me with very unfavorable glances as I passed on the opposite side of the way.
dickens|Afraid?
austen|It was her very particular friend, you know.
dickens|And heres Mrs Cruncher, or leastways wos in the Old England times, and would be tomorrow, if cause given, a floppin again the business to that degree as is ruinatingstark ruinating!
dickens|He entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of her room.
austen|Were not you struck?
dickens|The President rang his bell, and with warmth resumed.
austen|You will have no business here.
austen|Well, and what news does it bringgood or bad?
dickens|I have done my best for you, Mr Darnay; and my best is as good as another mans, I believe.
dickens|There, I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majestys service,a most excellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not quite so tight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,who knocked all the little mens hats over their eyes, though he was very generous and brave, and who wouldnt hear of anybodys paying taxes, though he was very patriotic.
dickens|As I passed him, his teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark of extreme humiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.
austen|Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.
dickens|There has always been an Estella, since I have heard of a Miss Havisham.
dickens|True, said he, and fearful to reflect upon.
dickens|It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as winter had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until two or three hours after dark.
dickens|I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at me, and got my bread and butter down my leg.
austen|But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede.
dickens|And you are adopted by a rich person?
dickens|Miss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that you give the evidence which it is your duty to givewhich you must giveand which you cannot escape from givingwith great unwillingness, he is the only person present in that condition.
dickens|Taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having the expression of prisoners faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly reminded of that expression.
dickens|Joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leather apron on, and passed into the forge.
dickens|Jacques, returned Defarge, drawing himself up, if madame my wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose a word of itnot a syllable of it.
dickens|If there is bad blood between you and them, said I, to soften it off a little.
dickens|It was then about highwater,halfpast eight.
dickens|Me and two more knows it.
austen|They, in their different homes, and their different ways, might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than any she had ever passed.
austen|You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.
austen|Not Harriets equal!
dickens|For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a long shout.
dickens|That, if Joe knew it, and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his beer was flat or thick, the conviction that he suspected tar in it, would bring a rush of blood to my face.
dickens|I said in a miserable manner, Yes.
dickens|Among the men, not one.
dickens|I admit nothing.
dickens|Three of em; aint there?
dickens|Mr Herbert threw himself into the business with a will, and by nine oclock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or Richard,whichever it may be,you and I dont want to know,quite successfully.
austen|The picture!
dickens|No, I was not a shoemaker by trade.
austen|A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered, and surprizes be explained.
dickens|If Mr Pip has the intention of going at once, said Wemmick to Mr Jaggers, he neednt write an answer, you know.
dickens|My husband, fellowcitizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence.
dickens|The old wintry branches of chandeliers in the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.
dickens|They fell into deeper shame and degradationif there can be deeperand ruin.
austen|She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on.
austen|My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,       Lords of the earth!
austen|one can think of nothing else.
dickens|That is to say Firstly.
austen|She knows I would not offend for the world.
austen|For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.
dickens|Wemmick pervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.
dickens|Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadnt robbed the pantry, in a false position.
dickens|He was a smooth one to talk, and was a dab at the ways of gentlefolks.
austen|But as to my letting her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any second application.
dickens|Be a brave man, my Gaspard!
dickens|As I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making some other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his own calling in life had been the WineCoopering.
austen|But where could you hear it?
austen|A little seabathing would set me up forever.
austen|He has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one.
dickens|I salute you, citizeness,  from the Doctor.
austen|But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.
austen|He was angry.
dickens|Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a greater concourse than usual, today.
dickens|There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress.
austen|I do not believe she often sees such at home.
dickens|There was a sofa where Mr Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in the attitude of the Dying Gladiator.
dickens|I dont want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to come here looking after her, said Miss Pross.
dickens|The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it splashed the riverwalls of the Island of Paris, where the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the sky.
dickens|O dear old Pip, old chap, said Joe.
austen|But I must write no more.
austen|Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again.
dickens|If I had taken ten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he never had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the idea.
dickens|There were few buildings then, north of the Oxfordroad, and foresttrees flourished, and wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields.
austen|Very true; and if I had my will, we should.
dickens|So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead.
austen|The less worthy females were to come in the evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already, at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr Elton were talked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour.
austen|Butin a very depressed toneshe is coming for only one week.
austen|I am quite roasted.
dickens|Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in.
dickens|I fear you are not well, Mr Carton!
austen|She had fallen into good hands, known nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent education.
dickens|If there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.
dickens|Shes such a manager of fowls, you have no idea.
dickens|Almost.
austen|Mr Knightley must not marry!
dickens|As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot with gray, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way, and every crack in every board calling after me, Stop thief!
dickens|Take nothing on its looks; take everything on evidence.
dickens|I had fallen into my serene state one evening, when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door, and fall on the ground.
austen|A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.
dickens|I know from terrible warnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right mindthat my memory is exact and circumstantialand that I write the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgmentseat.
austen|My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.
dickens|In Mrs Brandleys house and out of Mrs Brandleys house, I suffered every kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me.
dickens|Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door.
austen|The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwellsome of Mr Knightleys most liberal supply.
austen|She had often observed the change, to almost the same extent.
austen|Thank ye, the gloves do very wellonly a little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.
austen|I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.
austen|You saw her answer!
austen|It was the very event to engage those who talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news.
austen|What a pity it is that Mr Weston ever thought of her!
austen|She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sisters marriage, been mistress of his house from a very early period.
dickens|Couldnt you stretch a point and manage it?
dickens|And of me, I am sure, said Mr Lorry.
austen|repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.
austen|It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.
dickens|Mr Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original relations, though we continued on the best terms.
austen|Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.
dickens|It was too early yet to go to Miss Havishams, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havishams side of town,which was not Joes side; I could go there tomorrow,thinking about my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures of her plans for me.
austen|They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sisters sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a goodhumoured smile  Come, Mr Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.
dickens|Mr Darnay, said Carton, I wish we might be friends.
austen|But as soon as she Miss Woodhouse appeared likely to join them, he changed the subject, and began talking about farmingThe second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his being at Hartfieldthough, when he first came in, he had said that he could not stay five minutesand his having told her, during their conversation, that though he must go to London, it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all, which was much more as Emma felt than he had acknowledged to her.
dickens|Madame sternly retorted, I tell you a good deal like.
dickens|He looked at the two, less and less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way.
dickens|When I had gone into Herberts room, and had shut off any other communication between it and the staircase than through the room in which our conversation had been held, I asked him if he would go to bed?
dickens|Now, does he do too much?
dickens|He may not have known of it beforehand, said Mr Lorry.
dickens|echoed my sister.
dickens|Could you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair, if youve no further use for em?
austen|What are we to do?
dickens|I dont understand.
austen|In the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior partyin which her cardtables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true styleand more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.
dickens|They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler with them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.
dickens|The more I dressed him and the better I dressed him, the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on the marshes.
dickens|So, in my case; all the work, near and afar, that tended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an instant the blow was struck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me.
dickens|She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through the streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable close to him when he was got near his destination, and began to be struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him when the longgathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him when he dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot upon his neck, and with her cruel knifelong readyhewed off his head.
austen|I must ask whether you were surprised?
austen|I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that.
dickens|Ask him, said Herbert, when we sit at breakfast in the morning.
dickens|With his hand in the girls?
dickens|And that is?
dickens|Whereupon, Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel with himself.
austen|Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.
austen|It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.
austen|I am not now to learn, replied Mr Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time.
dickens|asked my sister.
dickens|I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see coming over the hill six soldiers.
austen|He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he had heard many people say the samebut yet he must confess, that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health.
austen|It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more!
austen|It is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.
austen|what was the name of its proprietor?
dickens|And then they stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their hands loosely clasped before them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now, easing a belt or a pouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks, out into the yard.
dickens|Who and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband of my child!
dickens|I do not think so.
dickens|While I was considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back, or the candle would not be burning, it came into my head to look if the wick were long.
dickens|That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had communicated itself to the prisoners servant, and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his masters tabledrawers and pockets, and secrete his papers.
austen|If you think he will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.
dickens|But may notmind!
dickens|There is always plenty, Herbert, said I, to say something encouraging.
austen|I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.
dickens|said I, with the best assumption I could put on of its being nothing more to me.
dickens|Influence; he says something touching influence?
austen|It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.
austen|I hope you have destroyed the letter.
dickens|All this she did without looking at me.
dickens|Nothing.
dickens|How much?
austen|Yes, she did.
dickens|I had the wildest dreams concerning him, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fear which I had lost in the night, of his being found out as a returned transport.
dickens|The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot.
dickens|Dear old Pip, old chap, youre amost come round, sir.
dickens|You summon no energy and purpose.
austen|You must have done well.
austen|Miss Smith!
austen|But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.
austen|Harriet exactly.
dickens|He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession; the Minister, the StateProjector, the FarmerGeneral, the Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by.
austen|Would not Mr Knightley shew them the gardensall the gardens?
dickens|I dont know how shes there, says Arthur, shivering dreadful with the horrors, but shes standing in the corner at the foot of the bed, awful mad.
dickens|The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that instead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.
dickens|Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you, said I.
dickens|It was.
austen|Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end!
dickens|I turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old marsh winds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had subdued me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were solemnly rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village fingerpost, smote upon my heart again.
austen|There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr Weston.
dickens|True, but not an English woman.
dickens|Well, boy, Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in the chair of honor by the fire.
dickens|What hurt have you got?
austen|We really must wish you good night.
dickens|I.
dickens|It was so very long ago.
dickens|Well!
austen|No indeed I am not.
dickens|from the uniform.
dickens|Never, Estella!
dickens|Well!
dickens|Yes, sir, said both the men together.
austen|She was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.
austen|Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.
austen|Very welland this offer of marriage you have refused?
dickens|Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his recovered selfpossession, he thought, There is but another now, and turned to walk again.
dickens|It does not take a long time, said madame, for an earthquake to swallow a town.
austen|He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.
dickens|He asked another man.
austen|It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.
dickens|But to give it you short and handy, Ill put it at once into a mouthful of English.
dickens|We so much regret it!
dickens|If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth.
austen|Oh!
dickens|Better not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy; dont you think so?
austen|A variety of evils crossed his mind.
dickens|Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air.
dickens|I was going out at the opposite door,not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started and swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was encumbered with a growth of fungus,when I turned my head to look back.
austen|No more it is.
dickens|I am glad to tell you that Mr Pocket and family are all well.
austen|Mr Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.
dickens|How do you do, sir?
dickens|I saw the idea suddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion, before he went on to say And there werent no objection on your part, and Pip it were the great wish of your hart!
dickens|There is not, pursued the nephew, in his former tone, a face I can look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.
austen|I never can call you any thing but Mr Knightley.
dickens|There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided.
dickens|At last we came to the door of a room, and she said, Go in.
austen|I can never bear to think of you all there without me.
dickens|He, too, is pointed out.
dickens|No children.
austen|Let me mend it for you.
dickens|I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the floor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were floating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded bridal dress.
austen|I see nobody else looking like her!
dickens|The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in the first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric countenance and a shock of red curtainfringe for his hair, engaged in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great cowardice when his gigantic master came home very hoarse to dinner.
dickens|You are still on friendly terms with Mr Jaggers?
austen|I hope they will not meet at all.
dickens|Are they very like each other?
austen|Such a heartsuch a Harriet!
dickens|I dare say, I went on, meaning to be very severe, that you wouldnt lend money to any of us if we wanted it.
austen|This letter is from Mr Collins.
dickens|Surely, the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!
austen|Mr Elton cared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped the young ladys pride would now be contented; and supposed she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could; and, on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, Rather he than I!
dickens|This had lasted but a very short time, when Mrs Pocket issued summary orders that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap.
austen|Her own behaviour had been so very improper!
dickens|Old Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we all went on together.
dickens|cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; Look at her so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared!
austen|No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present.
austen|I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills to keep him to themselves.
dickens|Dearest dear!
dickens|A hackneycoach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it.
dickens|If there aint Baby!
dickens|Whether it was a son who would never know his fathers story; who might even live to weigh the possibility of his fathers having disappeared of his own will and act.
dickens|June 21, 1792.
austen|I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.
dickens|But its not my business!
dickens|In any case, I will take care of him until you return, and then we will remove him straight.
dickens|Orlick!
austen|When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so.
austen|The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest.
dickens|When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church, across the mill, across the prisonseemed to strike across the earth, messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!
austen|There is no use in delay.
austen|Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.
dickens|he muttered then, considering.
dickens|And where the deuce ha you been?
dickens|He watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and he watched me as I separated two onepound notes from its contents.
austen|When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.
austen|Janes alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived.
dickens|Not all of one kind, resumed Biddy.
austen|He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.
dickens|How do you mean?
austen|Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.
austen|This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John Knightley made his appearance, and How dye do, George?
dickens|Did she linger long, Joe?
dickens|Not named?
dickens|Here, Mr Trabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves up, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity of black pins.
austen|In spite of all her faults, she knew she was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?
austen|From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink.
dickens|Has it come to this!
dickens|And at last he flung out in his violent way, and said, with a D, Then do as you like.
dickens|Not as she is, but as she was when she first came here?
dickens|If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting down the river on a strong springtide, to the Hulks; a ghostly pirate calling out to me through a speakingtrumpet, as I passed the gibbetstation, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at once, and not put it off.
austen|Emma hung about him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs Weston, whose marriages taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change but she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used to the idea.
dickens|As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into them, he required as much watching as a powdermill.
austen|Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr Darcys using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr Darcy in a most infamous manner.
austen|How odious I should think them!
dickens|So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I was wanted at Miss Havishams again, I set off on the fourmile walk to our forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply revolving that I was a common laboringboy; that my hands were coarse; that my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of calling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had considered myself last night, and generally that I was in a lowlived bad way.
dickens|In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune, said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, I have the honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us.
dickens|and he said No thankee, and I said Good afternoon, and he said Same to you.
austen|Very odd!
austen|Do not let me lose it.
austen|You have not heard all that you ought to hear.
dickens|She asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her.
dickens|Where is the man who was here?
austen|Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness, which shewed a mind not at ease.
dickens|All this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me down.
dickens|You will only die with me.
austen|She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.
dickens|Ha!
austen|You are comfortable because you are under command.
austen|he felt much anxietyhe must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.
dickens|Never you mind, retorted Drummle.
austen|Mr Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.
austen|I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?
dickens|Give me your arm, my love.
dickens|I play my Ace, Mr Barsad, said Carton, taking the answer on himself, and looking at his watch, without any scruple, in a very few minutes.
austen|Who is that gentleman on horseback?
austen|Mr Collins moreover adds, I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydias sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known.
austen|And make her like myself.
dickens|Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would have yielded before his persevering purpose.
austen|He had some intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.
dickens|So capriciously were the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.
dickens|I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes.
dickens|The condition is laid down.
dickens|But they were very decently kept.
dickens|It is not often, said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur Defarge, that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or of anything but black bread and death.
dickens|Upon which, the clergyman said again, WHO giveth this woman to be married to this man?
austen|there I amthinking of him directly.
dickens|But never by me, Citizen Defarge.
dickens|Without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which they were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into my mind.
austen|But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!
dickens|It seemed quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was not exceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he listened in a satisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick.
austen|That is, I know you must have seen her a hundred timesbut are you acquainted?
dickens|Herbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so blessedly what it is to have a friend.
austen|They aimed at wounding more than Harriet, said he.
austen|What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?
dickens|The usual noises, Mr Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect.
dickens|Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.
dickens|In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of place usually assigned to a gateporter in Paris.
dickens|Nothing.
dickens|You will want a good many ships, said I.
austen|She watched him well.
austen|Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennets general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.
dickens|Every eye then sought some other eye in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one another, before bending forward with a strained attention.
dickens|How did I know it?
dickens|When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr Lorry and her father, who were following, and said to the latter  You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least be tried.
dickens|On a night in midJuly, one thousand seven hundred and eightynine, Mr Lorry came in late, from Tellsons, and sat himself down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window.
austen|May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?
dickens|This individual, who, either in his own person or in that of some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble which in that place meant Newgate, called to announce that his eldest daughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting.
dickens|I felt mortified to be of so little use in the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends, and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.
dickens|Still, the Doctor walked among the terrors with a steady head.
austen|Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the overthrow of every thing.
austen|Just as it should be, said Mr John Knightley, and just as I hoped it was from your letters.
austen|To youto my two daughtersI may venture on the truth.
austen|Mr Knightley had done all in his power for Mr Woodhouses entertainment.
austen|Not that I care about it, though.
austen|the letter had much better be all your own.
dickens|I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me.
dickens|Now, Pip,Joe looked firmly at me as if he knew I was not going to agree with him;your sister is a fine figure of a woman.
austen|Things must come to a crisis soon now.
austen|He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a smile, observed, Humph!
austen|Yes, replied Mr Wickham; his estate there is a noble one.
dickens|After that, when we went into supper, the place and the meal would have a more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed of home than ever, in my own ungracious breast.
austen|It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.
austen|She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.
dickens|Towards Joe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat debating what results would come to me from Miss Havishams acquaintance and favor.
dickens|cried little Lucie, springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief.
dickens|As I came to myself with the aid of a heavy thump between the shoulders, and the restorative exclamation Yah!
dickens|Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes today?
dickens|Mr Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner.
dickens|I was not.
dickens|I have often asked myself the question since; but what else could I do?
austen|Only fourandtwenty.
dickens|With a clink for the stoutOld Clem!
austen|said she, I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.
dickens|and so he has em, soul and body.
austen|He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.
austen|She must abide by the evil of having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do.
dickens|said the spy.
dickens|There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I unlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joes tools.
dickens|He dictated again.
austen|Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room.
austen|continued Harrietthese two last!
dickens|I mean of him.
dickens|The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it?
dickens|Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he didnt seem to enjoy.
dickens|I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that took me away.
dickens|said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had been asleep, and stirring the fire, now Ill endeavor to make myself agreeable again!
austen|She felt for Harriet, with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad, opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her brain.
dickens|Dear, dear!
dickens|Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.
dickens|We had got to the top of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance, and that he was not smiling at all.
dickens|Carton took it up, and there was a folded paper in it.
austen|I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.
dickens|But in the general tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere, was a thing to transact itself somehow.
dickens|Miss Havisham was not in her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing.
dickens|Ive no more notion where I was born than you haveif so much.
austen|nofar from itcertainly plain.
dickens|Plots.
austen|Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?
dickens|I mount to the cell, with a fellowcitizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a gaoler.
austen|I have a great curiosity to see Mrs Elton, I have heard so much of her.
austen|Mr Dixons preference of her music to her friends, I can answer for being very decided.
austen|Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.
austen|She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself.
austen|I am sure, rather than run the risk of hurting Mr and Mrs Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might wish.
dickens|Little more than skin and bone!
