lisa simpson|aha !
lisa simpson|so dad's life would actually have been worse , because he wouldn't have gotten together with mom , his one true love !

lisa simpson|please don't say a man .
lisa simpson|thank you , but i know a story of a dangerous obsession with female beauty .
lisa simpson|it's called snow white and the seven ^

lisa simpson|dear diary , i must be brief , for tonight is the grand ball ^
lisa simpson|that's all there is the rest of the diary has turned to dust !
lisa simpson|yes !
lisa simpson|she wasn't a slave owner !
lisa simpson|our family was on the underground railroad !
lisa simpson|no , the underground railroad was a bunch of people who helped slaves escape to canada .
lisa simpson|there were no actual trains , and it wasn't under ground .
lisa simpson|i never thought of that before .
lisa simpson|what are you doing ?
lisa simpson|i wanna know what happens next .
lisa simpson|butbutbutbutbut ^
lisa simpson|i must know !
lisa simpson|well i am reading it , and when i'm finished , i'm going to use eliza's diary for my black history month presentation !
lisa simpson|listen april 20th , 1860 .
lisa simpson|a week ago , i had no idea what the future would bring , which , i guess , is always true of everyone all the time .
lisa simpson|anyway , last saturday night , i went to colonel burns's ball ^
lisa simpson|run !
lisa simpson|i'll never know if eliza got virgil safely to freedom !
lisa simpson|to the reference desk !
lisa simpson|that's eliza's mother !
lisa simpson|martha , you are the best .

lisa simpson|no , no , no , not now !
lisa simpson|quit !
lisa simpson|quit !
lisa simpson|computers , right ?
lisa simpson|our story begins with a spunky little spitfire named eliza simpson .
lisa simpson|the year was 1860 , and the underground railroad was ^
lisa simpson|and though hiram , mabel , and eliza are no longer among us , their truth goes marching on .
lisa simpson|thank you .
lisa simpson|what are you talking about ?
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|you lie !
lisa simpson|eliza simpson can't be a coward !
lisa simpson|she's the only decent ancestor i have .
lisa simpson|but i need to prove that my ancestor couldn't have backed down to colonel burns !
lisa simpson|huh ?
lisa simpson|there's no noble simpson .
lisa simpson|you were right , dad .
lisa simpson|i should have quit while i was ahead , instead of learning the horrible truth about our family and virgil .
lisa simpson|what are you talking about ?
lisa simpson|is there something you know about virgil that you haven't told us ?
lisa simpson|yes !
lisa simpson|i'm thrilled !
lisa simpson|we've regained our family honor and we're onesixtyfourth black !
lisa simpson|that's why my jazz is so smooth !
lisa simpson|grampa , why'd you try to keep us from finding this out ?
lisa simpson|racists ?
lisa simpson|now what are you up to ?
lisa simpson|hi .
lisa simpson|now what are you up to ?
lisa simpson|just close your eyes and think of milhouse .
lisa simpson|well , sometimes people who agree on most things have one issue that they disagree strongly about .
lisa simpson|in politics it's called a wedge issue like illegal immigration or gay marriage .
lisa simpson|you would mess up mom and dad's marriage just to get out of doing some homework ?
lisa simpson|fractions aren't that hard , you just have to find a common denominator .
lisa simpson|for example one half plus one third equals ^
lisa simpson|you'll need to know fractions to make that explosion !
lisa simpson|congratulations .
lisa simpson|you're officially a sociopath .
lisa simpson|thanks , dad .
lisa simpson|but you're so loud it's hurting my ears .
lisa simpson|life stinks , huh ?
lisa simpson|mom said she was tipped off by a note from me .
lisa simpson|but you know something ?
lisa simpson|i didn't write this note .
lisa simpson|you wanted to get caught .
lisa simpson|elementary , my dear simpson .
lisa simpson|leave it to you to misspell a word you see first thing every morning .
lisa simpson|but don't worry .

lisa simpson|the man hates pants .
lisa simpson|krusty , i've been meaning to ask , what are you doing on this tour ?
lisa simpson|yes , it is fitting .
lisa simpson|jews don't believe in hell .
lisa simpson|dad , are you okay ?
lisa simpson|ah yes , jerusalem syndrome .
lisa simpson|the name given to religious delusions or psychoses that occur when people visit jerusalem .
lisa simpson|hmm ^
lisa simpson|dad said he was going to unite all faiths .
lisa simpson|and only one site is sacred to muslims , christians and jews the dome of the rock !
lisa simpson|krav maga !
lisa simpson|no , the ants are the farmers .

lisa simpson|quick , we've got to get them back !
lisa simpson|there's only one ant left !
lisa simpson|well , i will never forgive you , bart .
lisa simpson|that only angers me more .
lisa simpson|you're not going anywhere near annie .
lisa simpson|as in little orphan .
lisa simpson|bart , she's only carrying thirty times her weight .
lisa simpson|our girl is slowing down .
lisa simpson|it's the natural order of things .
lisa simpson|i'm afraid she's got another two , maybe three days , tops .
lisa simpson|ants have six legs , bart .
lisa simpson|you're just a tiny ant , but you were strong enough to pull my brother and me together .
lisa simpson|now go and be free .
lisa simpson|/ what's going on ?
lisa simpson|dad , while i agree reducing consumption is great , it's hard to make permanent changes in your lifestyle .
lisa simpson|no ^
lisa simpson|i am suggesting you consider cheaper , alternate sources of energy .
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|i found what you're looking for !
lisa simpson|dad , you are leading the way in clean energy .
lisa simpson|dad , all it means is we're providing power to the electric company .
lisa simpson|dad , if we're really off the grid , then we won't get power when the air is still .
lisa simpson|but dad , it defeats the purpose if you're powering our windmill with the electricity from flanders .
lisa simpson|bart , please !
lisa simpson|i'm trying to hear dr house's third incorrect diagnosis before his final correct diagnosis !
lisa simpson|we're gonna go check out the wind damage !
lisa simpson|oh my god ^
lisa simpson|a beached whale .
lisa simpson|bart , can you believe that something so mighty has been rendered so powerless ?
lisa simpson|she's such a beautiful shade of blue ^
lisa simpson|i'm going to call you bluella the whale .
lisa simpson|c'mon , everybody !
lisa simpson|a whale needs help !
lisa simpson|whales are mammals like us !
lisa simpson|they're sensitive and deeply intelligent !
lisa simpson|i'm gonna get real help .

lisa simpson|dad ^
lisa simpson|there's a whale on the beach ^
lisa simpson|you've gotta help me get her back in the ocean !
lisa simpson|hurry , dad , hurry !
lisa simpson|but i don't know how to drive .
lisa simpson|a little .
lisa simpson|it's hard to believe anyone in that contest can be considered smart .
lisa simpson|i'll catch up with you guys in a little bit .
lisa simpson|you know , when i'm sad , i read something beautiful and true poetry .
lisa simpson|no , no , you'll like it .
lisa simpson|it's about the ocean .
lisa simpson|the world below the brine / forests at the bottom of the sea / the branches and leaves ^
lisa simpson|/ sealettuce , vast lichens ^
lisa simpson|girl , you're going home !
lisa simpson|you're going home !
lisa simpson|goodbye , bluella !
lisa simpson|send me a post card from tierra del fuego !
lisa simpson|bye !
lisa simpson|goodbye !
lisa simpson|bluella ?
lisa simpson|oh no .
lisa simpson|she doesn't like lying on the beach !
lisa simpson|she likes being in the ocean !
lisa simpson|maybe i should just be alone a little bit .
lisa simpson|bluella ?
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|i'm not gonna be disappointed again .
lisa simpson|ew !
lisa simpson|ew !
lisa simpson|ew !
lisa simpson|ew !
lisa simpson|ew !
lisa simpson|they must be bluella's children !
lisa simpson|hello , whale calves !
lisa simpson|your mother lives on through you !
lisa simpson|huh ?
lisa simpson|run !
lisa simpson|i mean , swim !
lisa simpson|i mean .
lisa simpson|those baby whales are doomed , just like their mom .
lisa simpson|i guess it's just nature's way .
lisa simpson|dad ?
lisa simpson|where did you get that boat ?
lisa simpson|dad , no !
lisa simpson|they're right .
lisa simpson|if the only way to save the whales is to kill another innocent creature , i can't let you do it .
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|the sharks must think you're a baby whale !
lisa simpson|it's the baby whales' dad !
lisa simpson|thanks for not letting me give up , dad .
lisa simpson|do you think they'll be okay ?
lisa simpson|hey !
lisa simpson|that's not true !
lisa simpson|first of all , milhouse fell because you tripped him .
lisa simpson|secondly , spaz is short for spastic diplegic , someone who suffers from a serious medical condition .
lisa simpson|thirdly , your haw haw , through overuse , has lost its power .
lisa simpson|well , i am one flattered and two intrigued .
lisa simpson|lisa simpson .
lisa simpson|i didn't know we had a debate team .
lisa simpson|and that is why hybrid car buyers should be given rebates paid for by taxes on hamburgers .
lisa simpson|currently .
lisa simpson|however , solar and wind are ^
lisa simpson|blondie ?
lisa simpson|first of all , my father no longer has any functioning credit cards .
lisa simpson|i ^
lisa simpson|i ^
lisa simpson|excuse me !
lisa simpson|is this what the framers of the constitution would want ?
lisa simpson|how many personal freedoms are we willing to give up in the name of security ?
lisa simpson|again with the blonde !
lisa simpson|why in the world would the color of the hair on someone's head have anything to do with the intelligence within ?
lisa simpson|sally circle was eating donuts and ovaltine when her father came in with terrible news .
lisa simpson|everyone was mean to sally .
lisa simpson|she was too wellrounded .
lisa simpson|she felt cornered .
lisa simpson|they wouldn't let her play foursquare or invite her to the box social .
lisa simpson|the end .
lisa simpson|that's a rather unambitious book .
lisa simpson|you're blond too .
lisa simpson|dye !
lisa simpson|dye !
lisa simpson|dye !
lisa simpson|dressing in uniforms is a good thing if everyone looks the same , it levels the playing field .
lisa simpson|it's better to just fit in with the crowd .
lisa simpson|oh , i can't go on !
lisa simpson|this rebuttal is a sham !
lisa simpson|you aren't being persuaded by the content of my argument you're being convinced by the color of my hair !
lisa simpson|well guess what , i am not a brunette !
lisa simpson|i'm a blonde !
lisa simpson|we must rid ourselves of these outdated clichés .
lisa simpson|not all blondes are dumb !
lisa simpson|not all fat people are jolly .
lisa simpson|and not all old people are bad drivers !
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|that's a dangerous attitude for you to take towards your wife .
lisa simpson|when there's cruelty involved , bart sure knows his history .
lisa simpson|dad , i'm gonna need some help getting this off .
lisa simpson|grandma ?
lisa simpson|how shortened ?
lisa simpson|another springfield family moves to detroit to find a better life .
lisa simpson|what's that delicious smell ?
lisa simpson|mom , it's so superficial to judge our new neighbor based on his furniture .
lisa simpson|he drives a hybrid !
lisa simpson|he's got koi !
lisa simpson|i know where bob's taking bart !
lisa simpson|oh , bart .
lisa simpson|i am so glad everything's okay .
lisa simpson|mr flanders , how did you make these amazing fish ?
lisa simpson|so that natural selection was the origin of this species ?
lisa simpson|mr szyslak , would you like to buy some band candy ?
lisa simpson|that doesn't work on me .
lisa simpson|i can see that down deep is a decent man .
lisa simpson|as an eightyearold girl in twentyfirst century america , i know how it is to feel insecure about your looks .
lisa simpson|but you've got so much going for you .
lisa simpson|i'd kill for your sense of smell ^
lisa simpson|you have a nice firm handshake ^
lisa simpson|and when you wag your tail , it really lights up a room .
lisa simpson|now , let's scoot together .
lisa simpson|mr cowell , would you like some band candy ?
lisa simpson|we're watching the nobel prize announcements , live from stockholm !
lisa simpson|quiet !
lisa simpson|it's time for the noblest nobel prize of all the peace prize .
lisa simpson|isn't this exciting ?
lisa simpson|why aren't i going to oslo ?
lisa simpson|the nobel prizes are my freakin' thing !
lisa simpson|but no bart gets everything because he's the oldest and he's a boy .
lisa simpson|and maggie gets what's ever left over because she's the youngest and she's a baby .

lisa simpson|principal skinner , i need to convince nelson to come back to school .
lisa simpson|he is .
lisa simpson|he's paying people eleven dollars an hour to work for him .
lisa simpson|isn't that a christmas tie ?
lisa simpson|oh , i don't know .
lisa simpson|i thought one of these supersuccessful people might tell you how important it is to stay in school .
lisa simpson|why look , it's mark zuckerberg , the founder of facebook !
lisa simpson|mr zuckerberg , i'm lisa , and this is nelson .
lisa simpson|that's great , mr zuckerberg , but i was hoping you could tell us how education was instrumental to your success .
lisa simpson|you did ?
lisa simpson|well , clearly , you're an exception .
lisa simpson|didn't anybody here stay in school ?
lisa simpson|there , you see ?
lisa simpson|i used grampa's money to try to help someone in need .

lisa simpson|i won't hurt my widdle sister .
lisa simpson|anything that's the something of the something isn't really the anything of anything !
lisa simpson|it's me !
lisa simpson|what , you can't stand the idea of a girl coaching a boys' baseball team ?
lisa simpson|hey , there have been plenty of female managers in baseball !
lisa simpson|really ?
lisa simpson|they sound like ^
lisa simpson|i mean ^
lisa simpson|well , the thing ^
lisa simpson|okay , bottom line i need an extracurricular activity , and no one else will coach you loveable losers .
lisa simpson|look , if you want to play liabilityinsured baseball , i'm your only shot .
lisa simpson|thanks .
lisa simpson|you can be the free safety .
lisa simpson|i mean the point guard .
lisa simpson|i'm gonna do a little research .
lisa simpson|don't call me honey pie .
lisa simpson|we're brother and sister .
lisa simpson|hey , dad .
lisa simpson|fine .
lisa simpson|i was hoping you and your friends could tell me something about baseball strategy .
lisa simpson|does anyone here actually know anything about baseball ?
lisa simpson|wow , i'm surprised you guys know so much about a sport .
lisa simpson|huh ?
lisa simpson|thanks , guys .
lisa simpson|everyone shift towards right !
lisa simpson|okay , everyone study twoout situations , count management , and i'll be back with some glutenfree crackers .
lisa simpson|bart , this guy's walked the last two batters , and if he walks you , we win the game .
lisa simpson|don't swing at anything !
lisa simpson|hot streaks are a statistical illusion .
lisa simpson|well , there's a ninetyseven percent chance i'm not , so do what i say .
lisa simpson|don't swing .
lisa simpson|you disobeyed your manager !
lisa simpson|here's what you're off the team !
lisa simpson|get him outta here , boys .
lisa simpson|c'mon , guys .
lisa simpson|i had to get rid of bart .
lisa simpson|that dinger was a fluke !
lisa simpson|not that i have to defend myself to you .
lisa simpson|managers manage and players play .
lisa simpson|i don't know ^
lisa simpson|yes .
lisa simpson|so because of your onbase percentage , nelson , you're the new leadoff hitter .
lisa simpson|questions ?
lisa simpson|he's not !
lisa simpson|he thought he was better than the laws of probability .
lisa simpson|anyone else think he's better than the laws of probability ?
lisa simpson|well , you're not !
lisa simpson|look , dad !
lisa simpson|players and coaches' entrance !
lisa simpson|i need you !
lisa simpson|ralph can't play 'cause he's too juiced .
lisa simpson|what am i gonna do ?
lisa simpson|i need a pinchrunner with speed !
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|now get out there a kick a field goal !
lisa simpson|kidding !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|no , don't steal !
lisa simpson|okay , okay , he's stolen third .
lisa simpson|but surely that's the limit of his cockiness ^
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|the computer says it's statistically impossible !
lisa simpson|stealing home .
lisa simpson|it's so impossible .
lisa simpson|it's against every sensible instinct ^
lisa simpson|it's , it's ^
lisa simpson|it's the most exciting play in baseball !
lisa simpson|go , bart !
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|but you did do something .
lisa simpson|you made me love baseball .
lisa simpson|not as a collection of numbers , but as an unpredictable , passionate game beaten in excitement only by every other sport .
lisa simpson|maybe it was , but according to my calculations , you're a great brother fiftyone percent of the time .
lisa simpson|can you put a number on it ?
lisa simpson|awww ^
lisa simpson|well , my latin's a little rusty , but i think to get everything back in its box , you have to finish the game .
lisa simpson|you're gonna have to deal with more nonsense like that .
lisa simpson|it's something you've never seen they're smitten .
lisa simpson|well , he is cute .
lisa simpson|but i'm sure a boy like him would never say hello to me .
lisa simpson|i love your pallor .
lisa simpson|how'd you do that ?
lisa simpson|they're just dots in circles .
lisa simpson|you're a vampire !
lisa simpson|i should be scared , but i'm not .
lisa simpson|edmund's almost here , so please nobody be themselves !
lisa simpson|i know just how you feel !
lisa simpson|bite me now , edmund and we'll both be vampires !
lisa simpson|sir , i'm not trying to take your son away from you .
lisa simpson|i plan to be a part of your rich culture , and organize mediafriendly events to help combat all the unfair vampire stereotypes .
lisa simpson|eight forever ?
lisa simpson|whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa !
lisa simpson|i can't spend eternity using kid scissors .
lisa simpson|they barely cut anything !
lisa simpson|uh , dad ?
lisa simpson|they turned you into a vampire .
lisa simpson|dad , i think maggie's just sad 'cause her set is missing baby musthave .
lisa simpson|didn't there used to be more texxon stations ?
lisa simpson|someday when i'm a grownup , maybe i'll go back and look fondly at our house .
lisa simpson|wow , mom you got first place in the science fair !
lisa simpson|mom , these grades are amazing !
lisa simpson|just as good as mine !
lisa simpson|principal skinner ?
lisa simpson|quick question .
lisa simpson|is it true my mom was a great student ?
lisa simpson|well ^
lisa simpson|of course that would be great .
lisa simpson|but i see myself making an impact ^
lisa simpson|outside the home .
lisa simpson|maggie , something happened to mom and i'm gonna find out what and when .
lisa simpson|mom's looking good through elementary school ^
lisa simpson|ninth grade , tenth grade , still ridin' the atrain ^
lisa simpson|then suddenly , when she was a high school senior blam !
lisa simpson|what could've happened ?
lisa simpson|dad , can i talk to you for a second ?
lisa simpson|well , um , i was looking through mom's old schoolwork , and i noticed her grades went down when she started going out with you .
lisa simpson|no offense dad , but no boy is gonna distract me from my dreams .
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|that's not gonna happen to me !
lisa simpson|i'm gonna make sure nothing distracts me ever !
lisa simpson|okay , i've gotten rid of all of my distractions , diversions , hobbies and ^
lisa simpson|oh my god !
lisa simpson|are you a distraction , or a higher calling ?
lisa simpson|all right , let's see .
lisa simpson|how many jazz musicians led long and happy lives ?
lisa simpson|there's , um ^
lisa simpson|mom , could you keep it down a little ?
lisa simpson|i'm trying to study .
lisa simpson|mom , is something wrong ?
lisa simpson|it's plenty good !
lisa simpson|it's great !
lisa simpson|it's just ^
lisa simpson|not for me .
lisa simpson|what kind of kiss did you get ?
lisa simpson|ice cold .
lisa simpson|oh yeah ?
lisa simpson|the seven of clubs .
lisa simpson|what's the point of getting rid of all the distractions at home , if i have to do my learning here ?
lisa simpson|willie !
lisa simpson|do you have to wax this floor now ?
lisa simpson|should i get the nurse ?
lisa simpson|dad was right i might as well give up .
lisa simpson|cloisters academy ?
lisa simpson|that bus could pick me up any day of the week !
lisa simpson|lord buddha , i know i'm not supposed to want stuff , but c'mon .

lisa simpson|i'm sorry , i don't really play .
lisa simpson|count me in !
lisa simpson|well , i am so happy to be in your class .
lisa simpson|did you get that the pony was actually me ?
lisa simpson|selfpublished ?
lisa simpson|that school is so great !
lisa simpson|teachers teach so much better when they're paid in money , and not in chickens .
lisa simpson|is mom gonna come up and say goodnight ?
lisa simpson|mom ?
lisa simpson|mom ?
lisa simpson|i see what happened .
lisa simpson|there was no scholarship .
lisa simpson|they said i could attend if you did all their laundry .
lisa simpson|i can't live with that knowledge while trying to get more knowledge .
lisa simpson|mom ^
lisa simpson|i don't want to go to that school .
lisa simpson|because , it's too elitist .
lisa simpson|everyone's parents are in the business .
lisa simpson|i don't know !
lisa simpson|they won't tell me !
lisa simpson|and besides ^
lisa simpson|you were willing to do all this just so i would be happy !
lisa simpson|mom , i'd be honored if i turned out like you .
lisa simpson|mr burns ?
lisa simpson|where's he going ?
lisa simpson|now they're dancing on his grave !
lisa simpson|hm , apparently mr burns is in a state of shock from the trauma he underwent .
lisa simpson|people of springfield , to quote shakespeare , the quality of mercy is not strained ^
lisa simpson|you know , it takes a lot for an eightyearold to stand up in front of the whole town .
lisa simpson|we're called little people and i'm not one .
lisa simpson|people of springfield , as a nerd , i understand your desire for revenge , but this sweet , harmless man is not the same remorseless monster who tormented us all .
lisa simpson|what did you do with him ?
lisa simpson|dad , mr burns is here for you again .
lisa simpson|a little tired of revenge , are we ?
lisa simpson|all right .
lisa simpson|mr burns , i'm gonna show you that not all of us in this town are vindictive and cruel .
lisa simpson|not today .
lisa simpson|i thought after all you went through , you just might want to spend an hour in a place where you felt at home .
lisa simpson|actually , sir , the man who lived here didn't have many friends .
lisa simpson|but you're a better person than he ever was .
lisa simpson|yes , technically it's you .
lisa simpson|hey , there's a number on him .
lisa simpson|what is it ?
lisa simpson|thank god your son can't see the way you're behaving .
lisa simpson|you said it was boston .
lisa simpson|like those chairs in the music room ?
lisa simpson|huh .
lisa simpson|it's a pigeon .
lisa simpson|the poor guy hurt his wing .
lisa simpson|or , more likely , the phone number of the bird's owner .
lisa simpson|yes , i believe i have your pigeon , raymond bird , and i need to know how to return him to you .
lisa simpson|yes , he could fly home , except that he has a broken wing .
lisa simpson|perhaps you and your sarcasm could come to springfield and retrieve him .
lisa simpson|looks like you're gonna have to take care of him , bart .
lisa simpson|no , no ^
lisa simpson|listen , don't tell anyone , but ^
lisa simpson|i can't stand pigeons !
lisa simpson|they're like rats with wings !
lisa simpson|oh ^
lisa simpson|okay , maybe he's not so bad .
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|get off !
lisa simpson|get off !
lisa simpson|get off !
lisa simpson|mom , it's just maggie .
lisa simpson|mom , why am i so repulsed by pigeons ?
lisa simpson|it doesn't make any sense .
lisa simpson|i'm a member of people for the ethical treatment of amoebas , the league of women vultures , the ndoubleacporcupines , kids for squids , the a .
lisa simpson|c .
lisa simpson|l .
lisa simpson|unicorns , clamnesty international and , uh ^
lisa simpson|well , those are the best ones .
lisa simpson|really ?
lisa simpson|i'll tell you later .
lisa simpson|it's amazing how i can feel sorry for you and hate you at the same time .
lisa simpson|i'm sure there's a german word for it .
lisa simpson|you're gonna put him down ?
lisa simpson|this is where we're ditching the dog ?
lisa simpson|not really .
lisa simpson|you do for me .
lisa simpson|marking a crime scene .
lisa simpson|to celebrate a ancient pagan ritual , this tree was cut down and tarted up like a dimeadance floozy .
lisa simpson|you mean your gingerbread mcmansion .
lisa simpson|so you're the brown nosed reindeer that's jingled all the way to the top .
lisa simpson|oh , i know what you're after .
lisa simpson|the toy you never got .
lisa simpson|oh really ?
lisa simpson|well let me ask you this , how many kids bring a gun to meet santa ?
lisa simpson|security !
lisa simpson|why can't they leave a poor tree in the woods where it belongs ?
lisa simpson|can it really be christmas when one of our parents is facing the german army ?
lisa simpson|don't dare bring that thing in here !
lisa simpson|don't worry about that .
lisa simpson|i love meat and i always will .
lisa simpson|mmmmm , that is some sweet pig meat .
lisa simpson|but as for christmas trees ^
lisa simpson|i used to love them until last year , when i went tree shopping with mom ^
lisa simpson|so i never want to see another christmas tree ^
lisa simpson|until mom comes back , safe and sound .
lisa simpson|see ?
lisa simpson|every time we get a tree , mom disappears !
lisa simpson|oh no !
lisa simpson|this is where they took mom from me !
lisa simpson|it's a sign .
lisa simpson|mom's okay !
lisa simpson|thank you .
lisa simpson|yes , but then i learned that there's always hope .
lisa simpson|someday this war will be over .
lisa simpson|someday our mom will be back .
lisa simpson|but until then this tree will stand for everything mom believes in home , family and constantly sweeping up needles .
lisa simpson|o tannenbaum , o tannenbaum ^
lisa simpson|nein auch im winter , wenn es schneit ^
lisa simpson|this is the last time i bring these two to bed at the same time .
lisa simpson|ms .
lisa simpson|stewart , i made a star for the tree out of discarded water bottles !
lisa simpson|i'll go outside and make snow angels .
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|merry christmas , mom !
lisa simpson|it's beginning to look a lot like breakfast ^
lisa simpson|did you get a good housesitter ?
lisa simpson|aw , poor baby .
lisa simpson|come on , bart .
lisa simpson|afraid of a little apple juice ?
lisa simpson|dad's underwear !
lisa simpson|happy new year !
lisa simpson|why are you hung over ?
lisa simpson|i didn't see you drink last night .
lisa simpson|your four eyes saw a lot today , milhouse .
lisa simpson|what's the skinny ?
lisa simpson|bart ?
lisa simpson|we've got to stop mom from going out with those women .
lisa simpson|could we hurry this up ?
lisa simpson|i am really uncomfortable being a girl in this store .
lisa simpson|hey , does dad know you and the cool moms broke up ?
lisa simpson|sorry you broke up with your friends , mom .
lisa simpson|come on , pretend he meant something to you .
lisa simpson|i'm busy .
lisa simpson|fine .
lisa simpson|just get in here .
lisa simpson|you could deliver newspapers .
lisa simpson|maybe if you buckle down and get good grades , dad will give you money .
lisa simpson|i've been doing the family's books for years .
lisa simpson|i take what i need .
lisa simpson|something wrong , bart ?
lisa simpson|i love it .
lisa simpson|i know i use the word empowering a lot , but this time it really is that .
lisa simpson|oh my god , me too !
lisa simpson|i can't take it .
lisa simpson|i'm just going to draw a hairline on .
lisa simpson|help !
lisa simpson|my macaroni marconi !
lisa simpson|huh .
lisa simpson|let's see what cousin jessica's up to .
lisa simpson|you can't listen to those women , mom .
lisa simpson|change threatens them .
lisa simpson|they didn't like it when the springfield shopper started printing in color .
lisa simpson|mom , your choice to go back to blue is so empowering .
lisa simpson|well , as a feminist , virtually anything a woman does is empowering .
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|it's oddly dehumanizing .
lisa simpson|the most comfortable ergonomic chair there is .
lisa simpson|'angry dad the movie .
lisa simpson|' angry dad addresses the family from the top of the stairs .
lisa simpson|angry dad slips and crashes down the stairs .
lisa simpson|no dad , don't say pained noises , you make pained noises .
lisa simpson|you know , your movie's not all bad .
lisa simpson|if you cut out the stuff that didn't work , it would make a great short film .
lisa simpson|many great directors , like wes anderson , frank tashlin , and tim burton started with short films .
lisa simpson|taylor hackford .
lisa simpson|the creative team from mixar !
lisa simpson|pardon me .
lisa simpson|i've seen all of your movies except cars , and i can't believe my brother is in the same category as the digital rembrandts of my generation !
lisa simpson|i believe it's from lamps plus .
lisa simpson|good luck , mr park .
lisa simpson|there'd be no shame in losing to you .
lisa simpson|scorpions !
lisa simpson|they calm down when they're near the springfield silvertongues !
lisa simpson|now they're aggressive again !
lisa simpson|i'm sure there's a correlation , but could there be a ^
lisa simpson|causation ?
lisa simpson|these flowers saved me from a terrible fate not getting an a on my next science project !
lisa simpson|that doesn't seem fair they won't let him escape , then they kick him out .
lisa simpson|i wonder where he'll go .
lisa simpson|this calls for some springfield silvertongue !
lisa simpson|dad , look !
lisa simpson|this essence of a wildflower makes these angry scorpions docile !
lisa simpson|that's him !
lisa simpson|dad , is there anything unusual in grampa's coffee ?
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|i know what you did !
lisa simpson|and i locked the back door !
lisa simpson|and that's why you're acting so sweet and kind .
lisa simpson|because dad drugged you !
lisa simpson|but it's not real happiness .
lisa simpson|it's just because of an untested drug !
lisa simpson|it was wrong of me to play goddess !
lisa simpson|all right , bart .
lisa simpson|what are you up to now ?
lisa simpson|it's okay , grampa you don't have to act grumpy .
lisa simpson|i know you're taking the drug , and i don't mind because you're happy .
lisa simpson|thanks , sweetie .
lisa simpson|i'm sorry i was so stubborn .
lisa simpson|i hope you're not mad .
lisa simpson|oh , i ain't mad , and i never will be again thanks to your wonderful , wonderful ^
lisa simpson|let me finish thanks to your wonderful , wonderful drug .
lisa simpson|it happened to the scorpions too !
lisa simpson|the flower essence must have the side effect of lubricating the eye sockets to the point of popping .
lisa simpson|look !
lisa simpson|so i guess the lesson here is ^
lisa simpson|cheech and chong are from springfield ?
lisa simpson|these are comedy albums ?
lisa simpson|the noisy minority ^
lisa simpson|the upsidedown bubblegum collective ^
lisa simpson|the regional lampoon ^
lisa simpson|the plymouth grok experiment ^
lisa simpson|fro and flo ^
lisa simpson|allan sherman's helter shmelter ^
lisa simpson|is it really okay to just drop them into the pit where the blockbuster used to be ?
lisa simpson|easter grass , cable ace awards , aquariums full of broken pinball game parts , popped but uneaten jiffy pop still in the silver bubble , samplesized shampoos , detergents and whiskeys ^
lisa simpson|this is so sad .
lisa simpson|can we help her ?
lisa simpson|you mean , just reality .
lisa simpson|so , how was your first day of school ?
lisa simpson|grampa , you're not dead .
lisa simpson|i never thought i'd say this , but dad is the only one who can help us .
lisa simpson|wow !
lisa simpson|i know i lay down in front of bulldozers to stop this stadium from being built , but i have to admit , it's pretty sweet .
lisa simpson|you're out of tonic .
lisa simpson|really ?
lisa simpson|can i see it ?
lisa simpson|aw , come on , bart , it's fun !
lisa simpson|that was kind of the same as the first time .
lisa simpson|why did i suggest this ?
lisa simpson|ooh , authentic american folk music , just like they play on n .
lisa simpson|p .
lisa simpson|r .
lisa simpson|initiate phase two .
lisa simpson|affirmative .
lisa simpson|roger .

lisa simpson|i'm trapped in an alternate dimension !
lisa simpson|an existential netherspace !
lisa simpson|i've been hey , how ya doin' ?
lisa simpson|no one sent me .
lisa simpson|i just knocked on the door and it opened !
lisa simpson|uh , how'd i get from inside there to over here ?
lisa simpson|sounds like most of the house is still owned by the bank .
lisa simpson|how did you do all that ?
lisa simpson|i do , i do !
lisa simpson|looks like there was magic between you two .
lisa simpson|would you ^
lisa simpson|be interested in teaching me ?
lisa simpson|what if you just taught me one trick ?
lisa simpson|i'm not exactly flattered by that .
lisa simpson|hm .

lisa simpson|willie , if you will ?
lisa simpson|i believe the expression is tada !
lisa simpson|my friends call me lisa .
lisa simpson|shut up !
lisa simpson|now , where were we ?
lisa simpson|oh , it's a lot less dangerous than you think .
lisa simpson|you can see me do it again in a talent show next week .
lisa simpson|there's no chance whatsoever .
lisa simpson|i'll show you .
lisa simpson|you don't open the top the locks are real .
lisa simpson|the can is in two halves , and they slide apart .
lisa simpson|from inside , you just push up .
lisa simpson|easy peasy .
lisa simpson|and there's no way anyone can figure out how it's done .
lisa simpson|raymondo , i am so sorry .
lisa simpson|i got rolled by a pro !
lisa simpson|haven't you ever been fooled by a pretty face ?
lisa simpson|oh , you think i'm pretty ?
lisa simpson|raymondo !
lisa simpson|you forgive me !
lisa simpson|i'll get him out !
lisa simpson|you're just gonna stand there ?
lisa simpson|he's going to die !

lisa simpson|ricky jay ?
lisa simpson|david copperfield ?
lisa simpson|penn ?
lisa simpson|teller ?
lisa simpson|but why ?
lisa simpson|wait , i know he's an unethical magician , and his tattoos are a inconsistent mix of hieroglyphics and cuneiforms .
lisa simpson|but he doesn't deserve to die .
lisa simpson|raymondo , i knew your heart was as pure as the ether that helps you get to sleep .
lisa simpson|raymondo ?
lisa simpson|we used our last day of summer vacation standing in this line , and now it's time for our reward .
lisa simpson|sold , to the lowest bidder !
lisa simpson|dad , aunt selma's treating a mob boss like an ordinary taxpayer .
lisa simpson|my lick .
lisa simpson|my lick .
lisa simpson|brother germs !
lisa simpson|bart , this is a truffle .
lisa simpson|a truffle is a fungus that grows in tree roots .
lisa simpson|it's one of the most prized gourmet foods in the world .
lisa simpson|bart , you can find them by smell !
lisa simpson|that's amazing !
lisa simpson|restaurateurs use highlytrained pigs to sniff these out .
lisa simpson|interested in these ?
lisa simpson|how many truffles did you get ?
lisa simpson|brown gold ^
lisa simpson|tuscan tea ^
lisa simpson|bart , i am putting this money safely in the bank where you will earn zero point zero zero one percent interest .
lisa simpson|three more big ones and we'll talk .
lisa simpson|as big as a baby's head .
lisa simpson|that baby's head .
lisa simpson|we haven't even gotten our salads yet .
lisa simpson|i'm sorry , bart !
lisa simpson|take the last truffle ^
lisa simpson|do whatever you want .
lisa simpson|sell it , eat it ^
lisa simpson|bart , you've done a truly kind thing .
lisa simpson|oh , so that's why they don't give pigs truffles .
lisa simpson|bart , this isn't a photograph .
lisa simpson|you just ruined six months' work !
lisa simpson|you're gonna regret the day you were born !
lisa simpson|bart , i'm afraid we need the help of someone older and wiser .
lisa simpson|why don't you just cut the paint out of her hair ?
lisa simpson|cool !
lisa simpson|/ awesome !
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|first of all , it's never wise to use the word spew in a love song .
lisa simpson|i'm sorry , but i don't love you , milhouse , and i never will .
lisa simpson|oh .
lisa simpson|usually , milhouse does it .
lisa simpson|why would a popular fifthgrader like taffy be interested in a milhouse like milhouse ?
lisa simpson|well , i'm gonna find out why , because this ^
lisa simpson|hmm ^
lisa simpson|shut up !
lisa simpson|i just want to know what she's up to with milhouse .
lisa simpson|a girl like her could get a fifth grader maybe even kyle lobianco !
lisa simpson|that's the first thing everyone knows about kyle lobianco !
lisa simpson|taffy's up to something .
lisa simpson|and i won't find out what it is sitting at a computer .
lisa simpson|it's time to get boots on the ground .
lisa simpson|you like my boots ?
lisa simpson|who'd follow milhouse around like that ?
lisa simpson|sneaking around after them all day has taught me a lot about this sicko .
lisa simpson|i am never gonna get my homework done tonight .
lisa simpson|all right , sister .
lisa simpson|what's your game ?
lisa simpson|i am so sorry .
lisa simpson|milhouse , i ^
lisa simpson|i ^
lisa simpson|yes ^
lisa simpson|no ^
lisa simpson|i don't know !
lisa simpson|it means that ^
lisa simpson|that life is full of unexpected things and you should never give up .
lisa simpson|and you're cute in the moonlight .
lisa simpson|dad , our lives !
lisa simpson|maggie's locked in !
lisa simpson|what's this key with the plastic skull for ?
lisa simpson|so how come we have all these other keys ?
lisa simpson|i'll return this to the school .
lisa simpson|returning this lost key to principal skinner .
lisa simpson|well , maybe a little .
lisa simpson|but i'd never break the rules .
lisa simpson|banned books ?
lisa simpson|band books ?
lisa simpson|could this key open ^
lisa simpson|get thee behind me namuche !
lisa simpson|that's the buddhist satan .
lisa simpson|let's give it a shot .
lisa simpson|no problem , just some cobwebs .
lisa simpson|i've discovered a mystery , wrapped in a riddle in the basement of a lousy school !
lisa simpson|it's like five classrooms in one !
lisa simpson|a science room ^
lisa simpson|student lounge ^
lisa simpson|mathnasium ^
lisa simpson|an experimental theater !
lisa simpson|all set for a production of samuel beckett's endgame !
lisa simpson|ooh , a pulldown map of ^
lisa simpson|nothing ?
lisa simpson|and this ruler is unmarked and ^
lisa simpson|the tabs on this popup book have no effect ^
lisa simpson|and this tooth has no dentin !
lisa simpson|everything is fake !
lisa simpson|what is going on ?
lisa simpson|principal skinner , do you know anything about a bizarre hidden classroom underneath the school ?
lisa simpson|it's real .
lisa simpson|i can show you !
lisa simpson|you're just pressing a mento .
lisa simpson|and now without further ado , i give you ^
lisa simpson|this !
lisa simpson|i swear there was a room here !
lisa simpson|i've got to get back in that room , but skinner took away the only key !
lisa simpson|what would nancy drew do ?
lisa simpson|hi , my name is lisa simpson .
lisa simpson|that's us .
lisa simpson|do you think you could reproduce the key in this photo ?
lisa simpson|how much ?
lisa simpson|keep the change .
lisa simpson|how did this bookshelf get here so fast ?
lisa simpson|i bet it's shoddy .
lisa simpson|what do you think of that , nancy drew ?
lisa simpson|jeez , they're dropping like flies .
lisa simpson|the children are on bus 23 .
lisa simpson|skinner's involved in this .
lisa simpson|deep .
lisa simpson|you know anything about ^
lisa simpson|bus twentythree ?
lisa simpson|there's only one bed that's just right for me , the bed with the truth in it .
lisa simpson|which is probably the third one .
lisa simpson|so the answer to our mystery lies on the other side of that ice bridge .
lisa simpson|that's where the ice bridge would be !
lisa simpson|go down !
lisa simpson|dad , stop !
lisa simpson|that's not a real arm it's plastic !
lisa simpson|no , i mean they're mannequins !
lisa simpson|skinner and chalmers loaded that bus with those kids ^
lisa simpson|but why ?
lisa simpson|otto ?
lisa simpson|are you the one who left the message on the blackboard ?
lisa simpson|otto , they're just mannequins !
lisa simpson|well , there's one thing you didn't count on my dad getting a giant wedding cake and my sister locking herself in the car .
lisa simpson|i'm sorry , but the team all got food poisoning at the prerally egg salad sandwich party .
lisa simpson|luckily , as equipment manager , i ^
lisa simpson|was not ^
lisa simpson|invited !
lisa simpson|woohoo !
lisa simpson|actually , i do have a speech prepared !
lisa simpson|you know i hate surprises !
lisa simpson|i like routine .
lisa simpson|i like routine .
lisa simpson|please !
lisa simpson|i went through my t .
lisa simpson|r .
lisa simpson|phase in first grade .
lisa simpson|now i realize that the greatest roosevelt is franklin .
lisa simpson|yeah , so he could shoot it himself .
lisa simpson|franklin roosevelt led this country through the depression and world war two !
lisa simpson|face on a dime !
lisa simpson|that's a lot of anger , grampa .
lisa simpson|bart , what are you doing ?
lisa simpson|what ?
lisa simpson|i'm telling mom !
lisa simpson|hello , mom ?
lisa simpson|you won't believe what bart's doing .
lisa simpson|dad , i'm going to entertain you with the help of the brothers karamazov .
lisa simpson|alexey fyodorovitch karamazov was the third son of fyodor pavlovitch karamazov ^
lisa simpson|a landowner well known in our district in his own day , and still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death , which happened thirteen years ago , and which i shall describe in its proper place .
lisa simpson|daad !
lisa simpson|anyway , continuing for the present i will only say that this 'landowner' for so ^
lisa simpson|ew , dad !
lisa simpson|wait a minute ^
lisa simpson|can you pass gas at will ?
lisa simpson|fart once for no , twice for yes .
lisa simpson|oh my god !
lisa simpson|do you realize what this means ?
lisa simpson|well , it means that you can communicate !
lisa simpson|exactly !
lisa simpson|i'll recite the alphabet , and you tell me when to stop .
lisa simpson|abcd ^
lisa simpson|okay , first letter d .
lisa simpson|d , e ^
lisa simpson|amazing !
lisa simpson|oh , but before we continue ^
lisa simpson|d , e , a ^
lisa simpson|dearest marge , though my body cannot move , my heart still beats and my brain still brains .
lisa simpson|i miss holding you in my arms more than my butt can say .
lisa simpson|perhaps someday there will be a cure .
lisa simpson|although if it requires months of difficult physical therapy , i'll pass .
lisa simpson|you are the shining light that gets me through my darkest hours .
lisa simpson|for further communication i will require more beans .
lisa simpson|i love you , baby .
lisa simpson|all strapped in ?
lisa simpson|now prepare to take an incredible journey across the room !
lisa simpson|halloween is over , which means america , it's time to start your christmas shopping .
lisa simpson|infuse our stagnant economy with dollars you don't really have .
lisa simpson|bart , you wanna see something cool ?
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|my science fair project proves that an asteroid will strike the earth on july 15 , 9789 .
lisa simpson|fine .
lisa simpson|good luck with your project , which i'm sure you haven't started yet .
lisa simpson|that's pathetic .
lisa simpson|bart , isn't that awfully similar to the cootie patch you did last year ?
lisa simpson|it's about an asteroid !
lisa simpson|it wasn't a pie , it was science !
lisa simpson|and it's not fair my project was way better than bart's , and i didn't have help from a nerd !
lisa simpson|i'm my own nerd !
lisa simpson|wow !
lisa simpson|while i was sitting here feeling sorry for myself , bart's invention actually changed someone's life !
lisa simpson|video game convention !
lisa simpson|this game has all the best college marching bands !
lisa simpson|from the precision footwork of ohio state to the lame , deadonarrival humor of stanford !
lisa simpson|uhoh , i'm losing the crowd !

lisa simpson|uhh ^
lisa simpson|before the koreans ?
lisa simpson|goorsha !
lisa simpson|goorsha !

lisa simpson|goorsha !
lisa simpson|goorsha !
lisa simpson|goorsha !
lisa simpson|goorsha !
lisa simpson|what kind of american man doesn't want to explore global food culture ?
lisa simpson|we should start our own food blog ^
lisa simpson|the three mouthketeers !
lisa simpson|people are loving our list of springfield's top ninetynine afghan restaurants .
lisa simpson|whoa !
lisa simpson|/ cool !
lisa simpson|it's called el chemistri and they use science to make the food !
lisa simpson|food dad !
lisa simpson|food dad !

lisa simpson|no fair !
lisa simpson|no fair !
lisa simpson|hey i know you ^
lisa simpson|wait !
lisa simpson|wait !
lisa simpson|come back !
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|follow that dinosaur !
lisa simpson|you're t .
lisa simpson|r .
lisa simpson|francis !
lisa simpson|you wrote the angelica button books !
lisa simpson|they're my favorite fantasy novels !
lisa simpson|but why are you working at a dinosaur show ?
lisa simpson|and why did you run away from me ?
lisa simpson|and how did angelica get a new wand after baron mortdeath burned the wandwood forest ?
lisa simpson|of course you're real !
lisa simpson|everybody knows you got the idea for this series after an explosion at a crumpet factory knocked you off a doubledecker bus .
lisa simpson|how could that be made up ?
lisa simpson|everything i believed about young adult literature is a lie !
lisa simpson|can i have my allowance early ?
lisa simpson|i need to buy some carbonoffset credits so i can burn all my angelica button books .
lisa simpson|doesn't it bother you that betty crocker is an invention of twentiesera ad men ?
lisa simpson|can you believe publishers would lie to their readers just to make an easy million bucks ?
lisa simpson|every book on the young adult charts is written by five idiots who just want to take advantage of kids !
lisa simpson|and they just cash their checks and get away with it every time !
lisa simpson|it's the perfect crime as long as you don't mind betraying the trust of vulnerable young minds .
lisa simpson|you're groupwriting a book ?
lisa simpson|but the only reason anyone would ever do that is ^
lisa simpson|profit !
lisa simpson|i'll show you !
lisa simpson|i'll write a book myself !
lisa simpson|a personal story my readers will connect with !
lisa simpson|this is how real writers do it .
lisa simpson|i'll just bang out two thousand words and then i'll stop , even if i'm on fire .
lisa simpson|i gotta pace myself .
lisa simpson|chapter one .
lisa simpson|wait , i can't start without music to inspire me .
lisa simpson|why is bach next to muddy waters ?
lisa simpson|that's my problem i gotta get these cds organized !
lisa simpson|there , finished .
lisa simpson|now if i win just two more games of online boggle , i'll be ready to start writing .
lisa simpson|spot , stop , sop , toptops , potpots , optopts , post !
lisa simpson|sitting in a coffee shop i couldn't feel more like a real writer !
lisa simpson|oh , better set up my wifi in case i need to do some research !
lisa simpson|but if i'm gonna use their free internet , i really should buy something .
lisa simpson|god , i love being a writer !
lisa simpson|i've got it !
lisa simpson|a mermaid falls in love with a boy on land ^
lisa simpson|i'm a genius !
lisa simpson|writing is the hardest thing ever !
lisa simpson|coming to the book fair was a great idea ^
lisa simpson|'cause you can't write if you don't know what the competition's up to !
lisa simpson|a dog wrote a bestseller ?
lisa simpson|aargh !
lisa simpson|all i've done is procrastinate !
lisa simpson|who am i kidding ?
lisa simpson|there will never be a book with my name on it .
lisa simpson|do i have to do any writing ?
lisa simpson|i'm in .
lisa simpson|i was raised in a traveling circus .
lisa simpson|my mother was a lady ringmaster and my father was a lion barber .
lisa simpson|i wrote my first story with clown lipstick on a flattened popcorn box .
lisa simpson|it was featured in the new yorker's best forty under four issue .
lisa simpson|what happened to me ?
lisa simpson|in one vulnerable moment i became the thing i hated most a literary fraud .
lisa simpson|aww , i've always wanted an aiden ^
lisa simpson|no , guys ^
lisa simpson|it was me .
lisa simpson|my name is finally on a book !
lisa simpson|and they're letting me write the sequel !
lisa simpson|a hard deadline is just the kick in the pants i need to focus and get some serious writing done !
lisa simpson|i'm sorry .
lisa simpson|no need to thank me , boys .
lisa simpson|you could never have printed your version of the book without the publisher's password ^
lisa simpson|so i pretended to betray you ^
lisa simpson|then after he typed the password ^
lisa simpson|i secretly switched the flash drives .
lisa simpson|i got the idea from every movie ever made .
lisa simpson|and the best part is , my face is still on the back flap .
lisa simpson|gaiman !
lisa simpson|krappy the klunk .
lisa simpson|see ?
lisa simpson|dad , you were supposed to read me a bedtime story .
lisa simpson|does anybody want my opinion ?
lisa simpson|proceed to the page with the butterfly bookmark as i cuddle up with madame bunny .
lisa simpson|genius .
lisa simpson|patience !
lisa simpson|patience !
lisa simpson|get on with it !
lisa simpson|well , i could help you ^
lisa simpson|well , you're getting my help .
lisa simpson|don't you want to be able to read the things people carve into your chest in prison ?
lisa simpson|we did it , bart !
lisa simpson|i'm a mentor !
lisa simpson|no bart !
lisa simpson|you can read other books too !
lisa simpson|um , i think we're supposed to get off here .
lisa simpson|hurry !
lisa simpson|we're heading for the falls !
lisa simpson|moom , what are you doing ?
lisa simpson|why can't we visit a real museum ?
lisa simpson|one that doesn't have the skeletons of the three stooges in the lobby ?
lisa simpson|hm , they're selling off all the old tv relics .
lisa simpson|i liked the knowledgeable docents .
lisa simpson|krusty ?
lisa simpson|well , you're not exactly my hero .
lisa simpson|i see you more as a cautionary tale .
lisa simpson|you're not licked , krusty .
lisa simpson|people love a comeback .
lisa simpson|look at robert downey junior ^
lisa simpson|mickey rourke ^
lisa simpson|you need an agent ?
lisa simpson|we met a ten percenter today .
lisa simpson|she'll get you meetings with the eye , the peacock , the alphabet web .
lisa simpson|you'll have a skein on the sked before you can say krusty's wardrobe furnished by hahas of beverly hills .
lisa simpson|ms .
lisa simpson|dubinsky , can you please just tell us why you hate krusty ?
lisa simpson|um ^
lisa simpson|who says we're gonna have kids of our own ?
lisa simpson|they selfreference each other .
lisa simpson|i need my books !
lisa simpson|we're not with him .
lisa simpson|looks like we're back to traveling on tramp steamers and produce trucks .
lisa simpson|it's too early to call shotgun !
lisa simpson|dad , you outtalked the talking heads !
lisa simpson|dad , i'm glad your show is successful , but i have to ask you what's with the crying ?
lisa simpson|so , what's this with the gravy boat ?
lisa simpson|you know , symbols can often rile people up .
lisa simpson|the swastika ^
lisa simpson|the new york yankees logo ^
lisa simpson|um , none .
lisa simpson|dad , you shouldn't do this .
lisa simpson|it's not fair how much influence you have !
lisa simpson|you're endorsing ted nugent for president ?
lisa simpson|he's a rightwing rock star who likes everything i hate !
lisa simpson|dad , you cannot endorse ted nugent .
lisa simpson|i mean , sure , we all love his music ^
lisa simpson|no question about it .
lisa simpson|but he's out of his mind he can't run for president !
lisa simpson|oh , dad !
lisa simpson|i'm so glad you've heard the voice of reason .
lisa simpson|dad , no !
lisa simpson|maybe because deep down , you know you don't believe in what you're doing .
lisa simpson|i knew you were , dad .
lisa simpson|i always knew .
lisa simpson|well , it all started a couple of months ago ^
lisa simpson|like all too many stories about my family , it began with somebody watching television .
lisa simpson|hm , i kinda want to create my own thing .
lisa simpson|do you sell any just plain sets ?
lisa simpson|well , i'll just buy one of these and build something different .
lisa simpson|trust me , i've left a lot out , and cleaned up the swears .
lisa simpson|anyway , i ran into some schoolmates and thought they might be friendly .
lisa simpson|that's what kids do , right ?
lisa simpson|hang out at the mall together .
lisa simpson|but when i went over ^
lisa simpson|hi , guys , what are you doing ?
lisa simpson|can i join you ?
lisa simpson|theythey don't ?
lisa simpson|i have no friends .
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|i'd have more friends if i knew what people liked .
lisa simpson|but i won't know what people like unless i'm their friend .
lisa simpson|it's a conundrum .
lisa simpson|hm ^
lisa simpson|it's easier to be friends with lots of people online than one person in person .
lisa simpson|what if i started an online meeting place where all are equal and i am the undisputed center ?
lisa simpson|no , that is not true !
lisa simpson|all right already !
lisa simpson|i had no friends .
lisa simpson|so , since i had no friends , i assembled a motley crew of the friendless to help me construct my social network .
lisa simpson|did we become friends ?
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|as the ceo of springface , i want you all to have fun as you write source code until you fall asleep at your consoles .
lisa simpson|nelson , you've just given us the template for our site !
lisa simpson|i never said it was diabolical !
lisa simpson|hit refresh .
lisa simpson|hit refresh .
lisa simpson|i have a thousand friends !
lisa simpson|and only eight of them are milhouse .
lisa simpson|wait a minute , grownups are on this ?
lisa simpson|that's not you .
lisa simpson|wow , i've created something incredibly popular !
lisa simpson|friend , friend , awaiting reply , friend ^
lisa simpson|sherri ?
lisa simpson|terri ?
lisa simpson|hopscotch ?
lisa simpson|double dutch ?
lisa simpson|ringolivio ?
lisa simpson|anyone ?
lisa simpson|i have a thousand friends , and i feel more alone than ever !
lisa simpson|i'm trying to set a mood here .
lisa simpson|as i was saying , springface was used in ways i never expected .
lisa simpson|i know it's awful and insular , and caused thirtyfive deaths , but i had friends !
lisa simpson|four digits of friends !
lisa simpson|i had a friend in common with malcolm gladwell !
lisa simpson|fine .
lisa simpson|i'll shut down the site .
lisa simpson|you really want me ?
lisa simpson|polo !
lisa simpson|even a kid who wears a finding nemo back brace has some pride .
lisa simpson|you went too far this time , bart .
lisa simpson|yes i did .
lisa simpson|now i'm going to bed .
lisa simpson|your bar is the closest thing this town has to an algonquin roundtable .
lisa simpson|yeah , yeah , okay , second closest .
lisa simpson|sorry , sorry , i didn't mean to be nosey .
lisa simpson|you have a way with words .
lisa simpson|mom , i'm gonna look at the desserts !
lisa simpson|yep , you're the crack head .
lisa simpson|what dessert are you gonna get ?
lisa simpson|um , i should probably get back to my mom .
lisa simpson|lisa .
lisa simpson|now this is the most important place in the world .
lisa simpson|this place is great !
lisa simpson|if i cover my peripheral vision , i feel like i'm in france !
lisa simpson|ew .
lisa simpson|how 'bout i'll just look at you .
lisa simpson|it's ^
lisa simpson|nice .
lisa simpson|mom , i'm sorry i'm late !
lisa simpson|no excuse , i just forgot all about you .
lisa simpson|huh ?
lisa simpson|i'm not sure that patch really represents who i am right now .
lisa simpson|mom , i have a crush !
lisa simpson|somehow i missed that phase .
lisa simpson|the boy i like is hemingwayesque !
lisa simpson|wow , nick here in our house .
lisa simpson|i hope it doesn't make him think less of me .
lisa simpson|mom can't appreciate the kind of boy nick is , because although i love dad , he's a completely different creature .
lisa simpson|nick and i met talking through a crack between two booths !
lisa simpson|man , that company thinks every time it adds a wisecracking parrot to a story , they own it .
lisa simpson|grampa , would you help take me on a foolish romantic mission ?
lisa simpson|mulberry island .
lisa simpson|we'll kiss there at sunset .
lisa simpson|ow !
lisa simpson|if we stop now , we'll never make it there by sunset .
lisa simpson|but grampa ^
lisa simpson|we could take this boat .
lisa simpson|i thought you rowed up the zambezi without a guide .
lisa simpson|you know , you were a lot more adventurous at the dessert table .
lisa simpson|shut up and kiss me .
lisa simpson|wait , how long is this love for again ?
lisa simpson|hm , that's a pretty long time .
lisa simpson|thanks .
lisa simpson|but i couldn't have done it , mom .
lisa simpson|i mean , the person you kiss under a mulberry tree is someone you'll love for the rest of your life .
lisa simpson|i know it's futile , but i must again point out there is no dragon .
lisa simpson|again , i maintain that money would be better spent on car insurance .
lisa simpson|i pick up books like you pick up beers !
lisa simpson|do we really have to sit here the whole time ?
lisa simpson|i mean , if we went out now , it might be cool to see the town empty .
lisa simpson|i could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana !
lisa simpson|if i didn't know better , i'd say it was a town meeting .
lisa simpson|why would you want to banish us from springfield ?
lisa simpson|dad , where are we going ?
lisa simpson|do we have a plan ?
lisa simpson|ahhh , smell that unpolluted air !
lisa simpson|y'know , i'm glad we're in exile .
lisa simpson|it's not perfect here , but it is close to nature and if you have an axe to grind , wikileaks is right over there .
lisa simpson|well , i did miss a few things about the grid ^
lisa simpson|like everything !
lisa simpson|maureen dowd , we've got a lot of catching up to do .
lisa simpson|dad ?
lisa simpson|dad ?
lisa simpson|dad , i wanted to give you a headsup .
lisa simpson|mom's birthday is tomorrow .
lisa simpson|it's time to start your annual mad dash around town to get her a present that's not completely insulting .
lisa simpson|wha ?
lisa simpson|mom is gonna love that !
lisa simpson|by who ?
lisa simpson|lenny ?
lisa simpson|they have jellies made of fruits i've never heard of !
lisa simpson|these'll go great with betel nut butter !
lisa simpson|but at the kwikemart , the only fresh fruit is the one banana by the register .
lisa simpson|wait !
lisa simpson|maybe paula paul left a message .
lisa simpson|yo , mysterious pranksters , it's time for dinner .
lisa simpson|just throw in a couple of fur is murders .
lisa simpson|daad !
lisa simpson|looks like dad's not coming .
lisa simpson|you're an undercover cop ?
lisa simpson|what is going on ?
lisa simpson|we're actually entering dad's dreams ?
lisa simpson|listen , everyone !
lisa simpson|we should fall asleep in this dream !
lisa simpson|one minute at this level equals two hours one dream level below !
lisa simpson|everything has rules , bart .
lisa simpson|we never do my thing !
lisa simpson|gramma !
lisa simpson|we'll take your word for it .
lisa simpson|power's out .
lisa simpson|you promised to help me write a haiku ^
lisa simpson|thank you !
lisa simpson|dearly beloved , we are not here to mourn their deactivation , but to celebrate their period of function .
lisa simpson|dad , they can only go three miles an hour !
lisa simpson|with great difficulty !
lisa simpson|wow , the tv's hooked up to the internet !
lisa simpson|you can stream whole seasons of old tv shows .
lisa simpson|stranded was a show about people marooned on a mysterious island that's riddled with religious and scientific paradoxes .
lisa simpson|it was huge !
lisa simpson|well , the first season and the last season .
lisa simpson|hello , lovebirds .
lisa simpson|i've been following your storyline from afar , bart , waiting for that inevitable point where you get into trouble you couldn't get out of .
lisa simpson|perhaps i could broker a settlement .
lisa simpson|hear , hear !
lisa simpson|i don't think shauna should choose any of you .
lisa simpson|shauna should choose shauna .
lisa simpson|well bart , i guess that's our cue to skedaddle ^
lisa simpson|face it , we're just kids .
lisa simpson|we can't afford stuff with zeroes in the prices .
lisa simpson|all we have in the world are the things our parents give us .
lisa simpson|i sold a couple of my rare jazz records .
lisa simpson|after a while they all start to sound the same .
lisa simpson|still love the genre , of course .
lisa simpson|not even close to getting sick of it .
lisa simpson|and dad donated something , too .
lisa simpson|well , well , mr neverwrong was right again family vacations always suck .
lisa simpson|i called it .
lisa simpson|called .
lisa simpson|it .
lisa simpson|kidzone ^
lisa simpson|let me guess a broken foosball table and a game of clue missing its candlestick .
lisa simpson|it's so diverse !
lisa simpson|i've died and gone to a pbs kids show !
lisa simpson|two !
lisa simpson|two diplomats' sons are in love with me .
lisa simpson|who will i choose ghana or portugal ?

lisa simpson|dad , what's that on your lap ?
lisa simpson|don't you think it's weird that dad stopped eating pork and drinking beer ?
lisa simpson|something happened to dad on that trip .
lisa simpson|this is worse than when he went to new orleans and came back with the southern accent .
lisa simpson|chief , is there really a terrorist threat to springfield ?
lisa simpson|intelligence ?
lisa simpson|dad's kneeling on a prayer mat !

lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|girl scout cookies get you in anywhere .
lisa simpson|please , don't do this , dad !
lisa simpson|i don't know what horrors you saw in boise , but it's not worth blowing up everyone you love .
lisa simpson|is that something your terrorist masters told you to tell me ?
lisa simpson|but i saw you praying to mecca !
lisa simpson|but wait , wait , wait !
lisa simpson|what is this ?
lisa simpson|i've told you that a million times !
lisa simpson|no one can use it but no one gets hurt !
lisa simpson|i can complete my dad's mission just like george w .
lisa simpson|bush .
lisa simpson|we did it , dad .
lisa simpson|we did it .
lisa simpson|you weren't shot !
lisa simpson|you know , dad , just because your mission's complete , it doesn't mean you have to go back to pork eating , and beerdrinking ^
lisa simpson|'twas halloween night , with the kids doortodooring , and all over town blood sugar was soaring .
lisa simpson|but the simpson abode was deep down in the dumps .
lisa simpson|'cause from little to bigger the kids had the mumps .
lisa simpson|then we heard a loud crash ^
lisa simpson|we were tempted to scat ^
lisa simpson|the fat in the hat !
lisa simpson|say , mr hat , i don't mean to complain , but you promised us candy , not mayhem and pain .
lisa simpson|so we hitched us a ride on a threehump gumbamel !
lisa simpson|a gumbamel's a camel but faster and humbler .
lisa simpson|it doesn't take tips and it's never a grumbler .
lisa simpson|so if you must leave in a kind of a scramble , then jump on the hump of a humble gumbamel .
lisa simpson|we thought we'd escaped from our psychotic guide ^
lisa simpson|but when we got home , he was waiting inside !
lisa simpson|actually , there's a little more .
lisa simpson|i could do what i want to bart's head ?

lisa simpson|help me , doctor !
lisa simpson|i won the science fair !
lisa simpson|i get to go to chicago !
lisa simpson|eh , bart , bart , bart .
lisa simpson|i have a solution !
lisa simpson|maybe the best way to keep students from cheating is to trust them not to cheat .
lisa simpson|what i'm suggesting is we create an honor code .
lisa simpson|the students would do it .
lisa simpson|if every student pledges not to cheat , and to turn in any cheater , no one will cheat the system because they'll be the system .
lisa simpson|hello , children .
lisa simpson|i hold before you a copy of the school's new honor code .
lisa simpson|i know if i can get the toughest kid in class to sign it , the rest of you will sign it .
lisa simpson|milhouse ?

lisa simpson|that's impossible !
lisa simpson|is bart cheating ?
lisa simpson|bart !

lisa simpson|oh my god , you found a loophole !
lisa simpson|why don't you just put this much inventiveness into your work ?
lisa simpson|you've presented me with quite a conundrum .
lisa simpson|a word you should know since it was on a vocabulary test you aced .
lisa simpson|but after some thought , all my worries went away .
lisa simpson|i know the answer .
lisa simpson|i'm gonna force you to turn yourself in .
lisa simpson|well bart , is that enough of a sign for ya ?
lisa simpson|did you know some historians think american football is based on an ancient aztec game ?
lisa simpson|bart , you're not annoyed that milhouse asked me to go to the american football game instead of you ?
lisa simpson|american football .
lisa simpson|look , while i'd like to help , i'm kind of pessimistic about the team's chances .
lisa simpson|no you're not !
lisa simpson|wow !

lisa simpson|they sell your posters ^
lisa simpson|workout dvds ^
lisa simpson|and all of your practices are broadcast on a webcam .
lisa simpson|and some of the angles are loooooow .
lisa simpson|but don't worry , collective bargaining will enable us to secure concessions .
lisa simpson|we're gonna push 'em back , push 'em back , push 'em way , way back !
lisa simpson|all the way to a new contract !

lisa simpson|and we're ^

lisa simpson|he's my dad .
lisa simpson|he worked two jobs to get me a pony ^
lisa simpson|he started me playing the saxophone you all love ^
lisa simpson|and anyone can put a band aid on , but my dad knows how to take it off so it doesn't hurt .
lisa simpson|and when my dad was a soccer referee , he had the guts to red card me , his only talking daughter , because he knew i was diving .
lisa simpson|in the history of soccer , he's the only parent to ever take sides against his own kid , and he was right .
lisa simpson|he made me a better person , because that's what heroes do .
lisa simpson|that's what heroes do .
lisa simpson|hey , dad .

lisa simpson|typical ralph nonsense .
lisa simpson|now that's what i call a modern family .

lisa simpson|i'm okay with no friends .
lisa simpson|it's easier to focus and it'll give me great material for whatever art form i choose .
lisa simpson|right now i'm thinking long novella .

lisa simpson|stop !
lisa simpson|i'm sorry !

lisa simpson|hurting your feelings made me feel better .
lisa simpson|but when i grow up , i'll find other weird kids and we will have the most intense relationships ever .
lisa simpson|and i'll always love you .
lisa simpson|happy mother's day .
lisa simpson|great !
lisa simpson|but from now on , we have to be totally honest with each other .
lisa simpson|our lord , buddha , says the secret of existence is to pass beyond fear .
lisa simpson|my brother is about to meet fear , and as usual , he won't pass .
lisa simpson|the last day of school .
lisa simpson|field day .
lisa simpson|when you learn to balance an egg on a spoon ^
lisa simpson|and run with your leg tied to someone who wouldn't talk to you all year .
lisa simpson|hey !
lisa simpson|are you coming to the afterschool pool party ?
lisa simpson|bart faced a terrible choice take a beating with his friend or slither off like a coward .
lisa simpson|and like he did with every multiple choice question he ever saw , bart chose b .
lisa simpson|bart won a blue ribbon ^
lisa simpson|but was it worth it ?
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|i'm narrating !
lisa simpson|fine .
lisa simpson|as the pin on the back of the blue ribbon made its way through bart's shirt and into its housing , the seeds of his comeuppance flew out of the woods .
lisa simpson|while bart was being outwitted by a baby , something was coming to a boil in our pop's brainpan .
lisa simpson|fourth of july fireworks were a different story .
lisa simpson|they meant more to my dad than my mom could ever know .
lisa simpson|it was the one night of every year that he never heard his parents argue .
lisa simpson|he figured it was because they loved the fireworks just as much as he did .
lisa simpson|with his mom gone , homer needed a hero .
lisa simpson|and no one was a bigger hero than the magical little man behind the controls .
lisa simpson|bart knew the worst thing to do was pile lie upon lie , and that's exactly what he did .
lisa simpson|so bart was revealed as a coward , and now it seemed like the whole world was against him .
lisa simpson|while bart was in hell , homer was happily surrounded by fire and brimstone .
lisa simpson|so milhouse got the redemption he deserved ^
lisa simpson|and so , in a way , did bart .
lisa simpson|which meant that at long last , my brother could get a good night's sleep .
lisa simpson|three feet , nine inches .
lisa simpson|that should do it .
lisa simpson|okay , enough theory .
lisa simpson|krusty's getting roasted tonight .
lisa simpson|if you don't let us watch , we'll just go to a house where some more permissive parents will .
lisa simpson|dad , are you okay ?
lisa simpson|dad , you're eating too much !
lisa simpson|i'm worried about your health !
lisa simpson|i don't wanna lose you !
lisa simpson|oh no .
lisa simpson|mom ?
lisa simpson|dad ?
lisa simpson|i've been listening , and dad stops breathing for as long as five minutes .
lisa simpson|mind if i sleep with you guys and keep an eye on him ?
lisa simpson|wrapping you in bubble wrap .
lisa simpson|i can't always be around to protect you , so it will .
lisa simpson|i guess you're right .
lisa simpson|that's all i wanted a tiny bit of control .
lisa simpson|i know , but they're not gonna waste a whole saturday inside .
lisa simpson|i've got an idea ^
lisa simpson|but i'll need that broccoli .
lisa simpson|these two fruit smoothies look and taste exactly the same .
lisa simpson|one of them , however , has the broccoli blended in .
lisa simpson|bart picks one of the smoothies and drinks it maybe he had the broccoli , maybe he didn't .
lisa simpson|no one knows , so neither of you has given in , and this horrible impasse can come to an end .
lisa simpson|mom , it's trash talk .
lisa simpson|you know how guys say mean things to their friends , the way women say nice things to their enemies .
lisa simpson|she's under a lot of stress .
lisa simpson|her husband's at sea .
lisa simpson|dad , dogs don't know when to stop eating .
lisa simpson|hey mom , can you pack me a dozen sandwiches in my lunch tomorrow ?
lisa simpson|meat , no meat , it's all good .
lisa simpson|no , whenever anything bothers me i harmlessly vent it to maggie .
lisa simpson|kids love 'em .
lisa simpson|we trade them at school .
lisa simpson|wow , mom !
lisa simpson|you're gonna open a sandwich store ?
lisa simpson|what's wrong ?
lisa simpson|this is so sad .
lisa simpson|in his homeland , dad was a nuclear engineer .
lisa simpson|no , no .
lisa simpson|you want to make american kids work ?
lisa simpson|um , i'm not sure this is the best use of my skills .
lisa simpson|one jumbo joe to go !
lisa simpson|one florence nightingale in a box and make it snappy !
lisa simpson|really bart ?
lisa simpson|hm , looks like ancient aramaic .
lisa simpson|fortunately , i have an app for that .
lisa simpson|hey !
lisa simpson|docetism ?
lisa simpson|making fun of someone's clothes .
lisa simpson|how original .
lisa simpson|it's true !
lisa simpson|it would be a cold day in hell when i was popular .
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|i found a portal back to earth .
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|that's super hell !
lisa simpson|dad , the tv's screwed up .
lisa simpson|it only plays married ^
lisa simpson|with children .
lisa simpson|this house is haunted !
lisa simpson|noble spirits , your time has passed .
lisa simpson|that was unmotivated .
lisa simpson|shut up !
lisa simpson|well , i guess you and i are in charge now , bart .
lisa simpson|but if we split the chores , i'm sure we can ^
lisa simpson|what are you doing ?
lisa simpson|oh no !
lisa simpson|you're not leaving me to clean this up !
lisa simpson|flaming tap water .
lisa simpson|i saw something about that in a documentary ^
lisa simpson|sad , sad , sad , sad , sad , sad , sad , sad , sad , cute !
lisa simpson|this one ^
lisa simpson|maybe a satellite picture will give us a clue .
lisa simpson|this is clearly a fracking site .
lisa simpson|how are they keeping people away ?
lisa simpson|this whole building is just a façade for a drilling operation .
lisa simpson|stopping mr burns may be beyond the power of an eightyearold girl with a book report due on beezus and ramona .
lisa simpson|but i know someone who can help ^
lisa simpson|the first female speaker of the state assembly ^
lisa simpson|a politician who would never ignore a fellow environmentalist in need ^
lisa simpson|my hero ^
lisa simpson|maxine lombard .
lisa simpson|assemblywoman lombard !
lisa simpson|you got my emails !
lisa simpson|how could you sell fracking for mr burns ?
lisa simpson|i am judging you .
lisa simpson|what !
lisa simpson|yeees .
lisa simpson|probably just another piece of america's space junk falling out of orbit .
lisa simpson|you know , they look a little similar .
lisa simpson|a little lazy if you ask me .
lisa simpson|regardless , i see no reason to believe that bender is from the future .
lisa simpson|robotic technology today is very advanced .
lisa simpson|it's not my birthday .
lisa simpson|although maggie's is pretty soon .
lisa simpson|this is the robot who claims to be from the future .
lisa simpson|what stopped you , bender ?
lisa simpson|asimov's three laws of robotics ?
lisa simpson|wait , stop !
lisa simpson|why must you kill my dad ?
lisa simpson|especially when cheeseburgers are doing the work for you ?
lisa simpson|professor farnsworth , i'm dying to know how you got here .
lisa simpson|was it a time machine ?
lisa simpson|that's it !
lisa simpson|all we have to do is dig up the time capsule !
lisa simpson|what a surprise it's bart .
lisa simpson|i can't believe you're all giving up without a fight .
lisa simpson|let me take care of that .
lisa simpson|if there's one thing i know how to do , it's manipulate barts .
lisa simpson|dad , we have beer in our time !
lisa simpson|attention goblins madison cube garden is filled with butterfinger bars .
lisa simpson|and people are laying fingers all over them .
lisa simpson|they're evolving !
lisa simpson|wow .
lisa simpson|that's a first for you , bart .
lisa simpson|wait , wait , wait !
lisa simpson|you're the portal .
lisa simpson|how are you going to get to the future ?
lisa simpson|why are you wearing your hat at dinner ?
lisa simpson|we're sorry .
lisa simpson|excuse me , but buzzard's roost is a converted parking lot .
lisa simpson|parking lot .
lisa simpson|parking lot .

lisa simpson|yeah , you really get that it's all about the music .
lisa simpson|dad , you shouldn't be jealous of apu .
lisa simpson|remember , it's all about the music .
lisa simpson|wow , he's right .
lisa simpson|mom , where's dad ?
lisa simpson|well , the story of jazz starts with the tresillo , the most prevalent duplepulse rhythmic cell in subsaharan african music , but the rest will have to wait .
lisa simpson|bart , bart , i hear mom sobbing and i don't know where dad is !
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|this is the year i've got to nail christmas .
lisa simpson|i don't want to be a jaded tenyearold like you !
lisa simpson|mom , i'm just a kid .
lisa simpson|but i say if dad isn't here christmas morning , that's the kind of thing families never recover from .
lisa simpson|i'm afraid we've awoken a needy giant .
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|you know you can't open a present till mom and dad wake up !
lisa simpson|oops .
lisa simpson|so did mine .
lisa simpson|i got a chemistry set !

lisa simpson|whoa , this place sure has changed since dizznee bought the rights to cosmic wars .
lisa simpson|they revamped this ride because of massive complaints from two people .
lisa simpson|we have been here six hours and the coolest thing we've done is stand in the cool zone .
lisa simpson|dad , i don't know about this .
lisa simpson|it's not on the park map .
lisa simpson|we've left earth's atmosphere !
lisa simpson|are we there yet ?
lisa simpson|are we there yet ?
lisa simpson|are we there yet ?
lisa simpson|are we truly in space ?
lisa simpson|and if so , why ?
lisa simpson|why does the last thing you say sound so ominous ?
lisa simpson|you mean like europeans were to the native americans ?
lisa simpson|or the belgians were to the congo ?
lisa simpson|now what ?
lisa simpson|are there any side effects ?
lisa simpson|so , you use a lot of solar energy ?
lisa simpson|why are you sharing all of this with us ?

lisa simpson|here you go .
lisa simpson|now do you see why i'm a vegetarian , dad ?
lisa simpson|it's called a knot .
lisa simpson|knot with a k .
lisa simpson|that's correct .
lisa simpson|this system is really rigged against us .
lisa simpson|um , are you sure you don't want to try me again ?
lisa simpson|really ?
lisa simpson|but i thought ^
lisa simpson|right .
lisa simpson|conquering .
lisa simpson|well , i guess we've learned that of all the countless planets in the universe , we have evolved into the most inedible species .
lisa simpson|like three bean salad at a barbecue , we will remain untouched .
lisa simpson|i thought we weren't allowed to do homework at the table .
lisa simpson|i knew he wasn't gonna like the stack parking .
lisa simpson|you know , dad , studies show being hypnotized makes you more efficient .
lisa simpson|i just wanted to see him cluck like a chicken .
lisa simpson|mom , dad's been hypnotized to think he was ten !
lisa simpson|so ^
lisa simpson|where is he gonna sleep ?
lisa simpson|i'm done .
lisa simpson|not right now .
lisa simpson|listen , homer .
lisa simpson|i just want to take advantage of this opportunity to have you enjoy my saxophone with me .
lisa simpson|i've been emotionally dealing with that all week .
lisa simpson|so , yes .
lisa simpson|look , dad had to get cured some time .
lisa simpson|there's nothing we can do about it .
lisa simpson|whoa !
lisa simpson|looks like our bird house is benefitting from positive word of beak .
lisa simpson|a bald eagle !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|let's take the eagle to shelbyville animal rescue .
lisa simpson|where you took that injured hummingbird you found on the front lawn .
lisa simpson|or , maybe we can nurse him back to health and set him free in the wild .
lisa simpson|dad no !
lisa simpson|elon musk is possibly the greatest living inventor !
lisa simpson|his company perfected electric cars and then gave away the patents !
lisa simpson|he changed the way hollywood drives !
lisa simpson|that's so sad .
lisa simpson|maybe we're the same , two lost ships in the intellectual sea , each of whom could inspire the other to ^
lisa simpson|hi , i didn't want to miss one more chance to spend time with mr musk .
lisa simpson|it is such an honor .
lisa simpson|he is .
lisa simpson|and may i save that paper ?
lisa simpson|no ideas ?
lisa simpson|oh , that's sad .
lisa simpson|that's even worse !
lisa simpson|he's taking your homerisms and turning them into his own great ideas !
lisa simpson|this is the most inspirational moment of my life , but , unfortunately , this is my stop .
lisa simpson|bye !
lisa simpson|bart , what are you doing ?
lisa simpson|foolish boy .
lisa simpson|you'll never guess elon musk's master password .
lisa simpson|i just wanted to see if there was a better life .
lisa simpson|even for a little bit .
lisa simpson|mr musk , before you go , is there anything you could do to give a little girl hope that the world of the future won't be as grim as all our current movies forecast ?
lisa simpson|i guess humanity wants its change one birdhouse at a time .
lisa simpson|hm .
lisa simpson|for a man who likes electric cars , he sure burns a lot of rocket fuel .
lisa simpson|what's wrong , dad ?
lisa simpson|i still believe in this town ^
lisa simpson|a town that deserves its own original song !
lisa simpson|and as an aspiring musician with offbroadway dreams , i'm the one to write it !

lisa simpson|like maggie and grampa .
lisa simpson|we did it !
lisa simpson|we wrote an awesome song !
lisa simpson|should we hug ?
lisa simpson|that works .
lisa simpson|but to be frank , there's not a lot to recommend it ^
lisa simpson|we've got a big sinkhole ^
lisa simpson|hashtag springfield pride has never ever trended .
lisa simpson|but when you think of the things we lack ^
lisa simpson|mom , what's wrong ?
lisa simpson|do you really think that we can write a song that does that ?
lisa simpson|well , it would've helped if you hadn't crumpled up all the paper before we wrote anything on it .
lisa simpson|take it , bart !
lisa simpson|i gave it to you !
lisa simpson|we couldn't write a song .
lisa simpson|we're onehit wonders !
lisa simpson|but , is that such a crime ?

lisa simpson|i'm telling mom about how the school freezer broke and they had to cook all the tater tots and the teachers took the extra tots home in manila envelopes !
lisa simpson|cook all the tater tots !

lisa simpson|therefore he is my model of manhood and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships .
lisa simpson|so i hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me .
lisa simpson|and i am far to young to defend myself against such onslaughts .
lisa simpson|a dog !
lisa simpson|all right , dad !
lisa simpson|so love at first sight is possible .

lisa simpson|lullaby and good night / go to bed and sleep tight / close your eyes , start to yawn / pleasant dreams until the dawn .
lisa simpson|are you going bowling again tonight , mom ?
lisa simpson|oh , bart , don't you see ?
lisa simpson|this is what psychologists call overcompensation .
lisa simpson|mom is racked with guilt because her marriage is failing .
lisa simpson|bart , i read about what happens to kids whose parents no longer love and cherish each other .
lisa simpson|they go through eight separate stages .
lisa simpson|right now , i'm in stage three , fear .

lisa simpson|hi , daddy .

lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|what do you know about france ?
lisa simpson|'bye , bart .
lisa simpson|you know , in albania the unit of currency is called the lek .
lisa simpson|and the national flag is a twoheaded eagle on a red field .
lisa simpson|and the main export is furious political thought .
lisa simpson|i'm defending a country where people can think and act and worship any way they want .
lisa simpson|can , too .
lisa simpson|can , too .
lisa simpson|well , okay .
lisa simpson|your paperthin commitment to your children sends shivers down my spine .
lisa simpson|may i be excused ?

lisa simpson|look , mom .
lisa simpson|there he is .
lisa simpson|he brought us gifts .

lisa simpson|we'd kill ourselves !
lisa simpson|the cannon .
lisa simpson|the cannon .
lisa simpson|the cannon .
lisa simpson|the cannon .

lisa simpson|if cartoons were meant for adults , they'd put them on in prime time .
lisa simpson|oh no !
lisa simpson|his face is so fleshcolored and sad .
lisa simpson|i'm watching sideshow bob .
lisa simpson|you know , he's a lot less patronizing than krusty used to be .
lisa simpson|snap out of it , bart .
lisa simpson|face the facts .
lisa simpson|all those hours we spent staring at krusty , we were staring at a crook .
lisa simpson|oh , bart .
lisa simpson|you do ?
lisa simpson|why ?
lisa simpson|no , why ?
lisa simpson|yeah man .
lisa simpson|bart , look !
lisa simpson|come on , bart .
lisa simpson|the tape showed that the robber heated up a burrito .
lisa simpson|don't you remember the getwell card we sent to krusty ?
lisa simpson|it was after his heart attack , when he had a pacemaker put in .
lisa simpson|wait a minute .
lisa simpson|krusty can't read .
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|don't you get it , bart ?
lisa simpson|how could krusty have been reading a magazine if he can't read ?
lisa simpson|bart , i'm starting to think you're right .
lisa simpson|krusty was framed .
lisa simpson|did he have any enemies ?
lisa simpson|sideshow bob !
lisa simpson|come on , bart .
lisa simpson|go with the flow .
lisa simpson|with all our hearts !
lisa simpson|bart , there's one left and it's mine !

lisa simpson|come on , come on .
lisa simpson|finally !
lisa simpson|i'm calling to report the babysitter bandit .

lisa simpson|quiet , bart .
lisa simpson|let's make the best of this .
lisa simpson|maggie , maggie .
lisa simpson|maggie , wanna watch the happy little elves again ?
lisa simpson|okay , but you have to untie me first .
lisa simpson|we caught her !
lisa simpson|we caught the babysitter bandit !
lisa simpson|she's tied up at our house right now !
lisa simpson|is there a reward ?
lisa simpson|if she's convicted , we get tshirts .
lisa simpson|he doesn't care , mom .
lisa simpson|well , okay .
lisa simpson|i got an a on my vocabulary test .
lisa simpson|everyone knows you're faking it , bart .
lisa simpson|you're gonna have to fail that history test sooner or later .
lisa simpson|prayer , the last refuge of a scoundrel .
lisa simpson|i heard you last night , bart .
lisa simpson|you prayed for this .
lisa simpson|now your prayers have been answered .
lisa simpson|i'm no theologian .
lisa simpson|i don't know who or what god is exactly .
lisa simpson|all i know is he's a force more powerful than mom and dad put together and you owe him big .
lisa simpson|an absence of mood swings and some stability in my life .
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|dad is taking this in a less than heroic fashion .
lisa simpson|and the policeman on the other end of the phone said , we have traced the call .
lisa simpson|it's coming from the floor below you .
lisa simpson|get out of the house !
lisa simpson|but it was too late .
lisa simpson|end of story .
lisa simpson|is too .
lisa simpson|is too .
lisa simpson|is too .
lisa simpson|fine .
lisa simpson|then you tell one scarier .
lisa simpson|oh , brother .
lisa simpson|ow !
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|bart threw a book at me .
lisa simpson|did too .
lisa simpson|did too .
lisa simpson|it looks like a vortex a gateway into another dimension .
lisa simpson|quit throwing your garbage into our dimension .
lisa simpson|i can feel an evil presence in this house .
lisa simpson|sorry ^
lisa simpson|sorry bart .
lisa simpson|sorry , mom ^
lisa simpson|sorry maggie ^
lisa simpson|sorry lisa .
lisa simpson|that's okay .
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|look !
lisa simpson|it's an ancient indian burial ground .
lisa simpson|why are you trying to scare us ?
lisa simpson|are you trying to keep us from getting close to you ^
lisa simpson|maybe even loving you ?
lisa simpson|it chose to destroy itself rather than live with us .
lisa simpson|you can't help but feel a little rejected .
lisa simpson|that wasn't scary at all , bart .
lisa simpson|heh ^
lisa simpson|heh ^
lisa simpson|heh .
lisa simpson|look , i know that to you we simpsons are a lower order of life .
lisa simpson|we face that prejudice every day of our lives , but we are happy on our little planet .
lisa simpson|we throw ourselves on your mercy .
lisa simpson|please return us to ^
lisa simpson|fried shrimp .
lisa simpson|there's something not quite right about this .
lisa simpson|hey , how come we never see you guys eat ?
lisa simpson|stop !
lisa simpson|don't you see what's happening here ?
lisa simpson|they're fattening us up so they can eat us .
lisa simpson|if you don't believe me , look at this book i found .
lisa simpson|wait a minute !
lisa simpson|well , why were you trying to make us eat all the time ?
lisa simpson|there were monsters on that ship .
lisa simpson|and truly we were them .
lisa simpson|for your information , i'm about to read you a classic tale of terror by edgar allan poe .
lisa simpson|don't worry , bart .
lisa simpson|you won't learn anything .
lisa simpson|it's called , the raven .
lisa simpson|bart , he's establishing mood .
lisa simpson|what ?
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|stop it .
lisa simpson|he says nevermore .
lisa simpson|that's all he'll ever say .
lisa simpson|well , it was written in 1845 .
lisa simpson|maybe people were easier to scare back then .
lisa simpson|not yet , sir .
lisa simpson|my brother's using worms but i who feel that tranquility far outweighs the actual catching of fish , am using nothing .
lisa simpson|try not to spill anything , dad .
lisa simpson|oooo , a political discussion at our table .
lisa simpson|i feel like a kennedy .
lisa simpson|mr burns , your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train .
lisa simpson|why are you so popular ?
lisa simpson|hmmm .
lisa simpson|well as long as i'm asking something , can i ask him to assuage my fears that he's contaminating the planet in a manner that may one day render it uninhabitable ?
lisa simpson|yes , sir .
lisa simpson|a very inane one .
lisa simpson|mr burns , your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train .
lisa simpson|why are you so popular ?
lisa simpson|oh mom , that felt awful .
lisa simpson|but mom , we've become the tools of evil .
lisa simpson|mr burns , i hardly see what destroying our meager possessions is going to accomplish .
lisa simpson|i can't think of a better place to spend a balmy summer's night than the old ball yard .
lisa simpson|there's just the green grass of the outfield , the crushed brick of the infield , and the white chalk lines that divide the man from the little boy .
lisa simpson|yeah , you throw like me .
lisa simpson|we want a catcher / not a belly scratcher !
lisa simpson|our lives have taken an odd turn .
lisa simpson|i can't leave springfield .
lisa simpson|i was born here and i thought i would die here .
lisa simpson|but , dad .
lisa simpson|we're simple people with simple values .
lisa simpson|capital city is too big and too complex .
lisa simpson|everyone in springfield knows us and has forgiven us .
lisa simpson|whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger .
lisa simpson|i can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better , my leaving would actually have meant something .
lisa simpson|the pennyloafer !
lisa simpson|capital city yeah !
lisa simpson|there he is !
lisa simpson|mom , what's he doing wrong ?
lisa simpson|but i can't go back !
lisa simpson|not after i've seen the bright lights of capital city .
lisa simpson|i'll wither and die like a hothouse flower .
lisa simpson|read the bosom part again , dad .
lisa simpson|and i'm studying for the math fair .
lisa simpson|if i win , i'll bring home a brand new protractor .
lisa simpson|hi , bart .
lisa simpson|what're you doing ?
lisa simpson|well , a blockaded bishop is of little value , but i think you're referring to a pawn .
lisa simpson|i know .
lisa simpson|it's times like this that i'm thankful dad has little to no interest in almost everything i do .
lisa simpson|bart , i think i can help you .
lisa simpson|our journey begins here at the library .
lisa simpson|hi , mrs norton .
lisa simpson|hi , ralph .
lisa simpson|hey , gang .
lisa simpson|okay , bart , this is the card catalog .
lisa simpson|let's see , golf ^
lisa simpson|anecdotes , eisenhower and , fashion , humor , japanese obsession with ^
lisa simpson|ah , here it is .
lisa simpson|putting .
lisa simpson|and , finally , the most important book of all , the tao te ching by lao tzu .
lisa simpson|bart , we're just gonna borrow them .
lisa simpson|i want you to shut off the logical part of your mind .
lisa simpson|embrace nothingness .
lisa simpson|become like an uncarved stone .
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|you're just pretending to know what i'm talking about .
lisa simpson|well , it's very frustrating .
lisa simpson|bart , i have a riddle for you what's the sound of one hand clapping ?
lisa simpson|no , bart .
lisa simpson|it's a threethousandyearold riddle with no answer .
lisa simpson|it's supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought .
lisa simpson|let's try another one if a tree falls in the woods and no one's around , does it make a sound ?
lisa simpson|but bart , how can a sound exist if there's no one there to hear it ?
lisa simpson|it is time .
lisa simpson|the basis of this game seems to be simple geometry .
lisa simpson|all you have to do is hit the ball here .
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|eighth hole .
lisa simpson|twelfth hole .
lisa simpson|nirvana .
lisa simpson|mom , bart is on a strict diet of complex carbohydrates .
lisa simpson|steak will make him logy .
lisa simpson|oatmeal .
lisa simpson|oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she wins the kentucky derby .
lisa simpson|bart , having never received any words of encouragement myself , i'm not sure how they're supposed to sound .
lisa simpson|but here goes .
lisa simpson|i believe in you .
lisa simpson|why do i get the feeling that someday i'll be describing this to a psychiatrist ?
lisa simpson|bart , cut it out !
lisa simpson|it's not yours , bart !
lisa simpson|this is family glue !
lisa simpson|dad , this isn't about glue .
lisa simpson|it's about territoriality .
lisa simpson|he only wants the glue because i'm using it .
lisa simpson|here .
lisa simpson|maggie , i'm about to unveil my centerpiece to the family !
lisa simpson|it's a tribute to the trailblazing women who made our country great ^
lisa simpson|see , there's georgia o'keefe ^
lisa simpson|susan b .
lisa simpson|anthony ^
lisa simpson|and this is marjorie stoneman douglas .
lisa simpson|i'm sure you haven't heard of her , but she worked her whole life to preserve the florida everglades .
lisa simpson|as one of the simpson women , would you like to contribute something to it ?
lisa simpson|oh , thank you .
lisa simpson|i couldn't tell you how many hours .
lisa simpson|it was a labor of love .
lisa simpson|it's my homage to some american heroes who may not have fought in any wars , but who nevertheless ^
lisa simpson|it's the centerpiece , bart !
lisa simpson|hey , bart , stop it !
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|baaart !
lisa simpson|you're wrecking it !
lisa simpson|let go !
lisa simpson|i worked forever on this !
lisa simpson|baaarrtt !
lisa simpson|you don't even care !
lisa simpson|you don't even care !
lisa simpson|that's all right .
lisa simpson|mom , i poured my heart into that centerpiece !
lisa simpson|things like that always happen in this family !
lisa simpson|i saw the best meals of my generation destroyed by the madness of my brother / my soul carved in slices by spikeyhaired demons ^
lisa simpson|howl of the unappreciated , by lisa simpson .
lisa simpson|i saw the best meal ^
lisa simpson|welcome back .
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|i'm sorry we had such a terrible fight .
lisa simpson|yeah , beg me , bart .
lisa simpson|beg me !
lisa simpson|dear log , my brother is still missing , and maybe it's my fault because i failed to take his abuse with good humor .
lisa simpson|i miss him so much already , that i don't know ^
lisa simpson|bart ^
lisa simpson|where are you ?
lisa simpson|bart , what are you doing up here ?
lisa simpson|everybody's worried .
lisa simpson|yes .
lisa simpson|bart , why did you burn my centerpiece ?
lisa simpson|was it because you hate me , or because you're bad ?
lisa simpson|just tell me you're sorry .
lisa simpson|bart , the only reason to apologize is if you look deep down inside yourself and you find a spot , something you wish wasn't there , because you feel bad you hurt your sister's feelings .
lisa simpson|just look !
lisa simpson|apology accepted .
lisa simpson|yes , but i'm afraid the forces of history have changed wrestling , perhaps forever .
lisa simpson|oh , bart , i hope you're not taking this seriously .
lisa simpson|even a fiveyearold knows that this is as choreographed as any ballet .
lisa simpson|aren't you forgetting something ?
lisa simpson|i'll be playing my first solo .
lisa simpson|if you miss it on saturday , i'd advise you to start looking for a child therapist on sunday .
lisa simpson|i reached him .
lisa simpson|dad ?
lisa simpson|another barrier broken .
lisa simpson|right on , sister !
lisa simpson|stop !
lisa simpson|springfield gorge ?
lisa simpson|bart , you'll be killed !
lisa simpson|please , before you do anything , there's someone i'd like you to talk to .
lisa simpson|thank you for arranging this , dr hibbert .
lisa simpson|mr murdock , my brother is thinking about jumping springfield gorge on a skateboard .
lisa simpson|but captain murdock !
lisa simpson|i'm sorry , bart .
lisa simpson|but if you got hurt or died , despite the extra attention i'd receive , i'd miss you .
lisa simpson|hey , mom .
lisa simpson|what're doing ?
lisa simpson|/we were watching that !
lisa simpson|but , mom !
lisa simpson|if you take our cartoons away , we'll grow up without a sense of humor and be robots .
lisa simpson|and i'm going over to janey's again .
lisa simpson|we're going to be ^
lisa simpson|um ^
lisa simpson|making the most of our childhood years .
lisa simpson|we will .
lisa simpson|there's peas everywhere .
lisa simpson|there she is !
lisa simpson|all right !
lisa simpson|itchy and scratchy seem to have lost their edge .
lisa simpson|maybe there's something else to do on this planet .
lisa simpson|and janey and i went bird watching .
lisa simpson|we saw a grackle .
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|may we please be excused ?
lisa simpson|excuse me , mr hutz .
lisa simpson|are you a shyster ?
lisa simpson|hello , dr hibbert .
lisa simpson|dad , may i please make an observation ?
lisa simpson|i think this is all a charade to make bart look more injured than he really is .
lisa simpson|thursday meatloaf night .
lisa simpson|as it was , is now , and ever shall be .
lisa simpson|well , you're always trying to teach me to be openedminded , try new things , live life to the ^
lisa simpson|friday night , pork chops .
lisa simpson|from cradle to grave ^
lisa simpson|etched in stone in god's library somewhere ^
lisa simpson|anywhere but hamburgers , pizza or fried chicken .
lisa simpson|as usual , the playground has the facts right , but missed the point entirely .
lisa simpson|sushi is considered quite a delicacy .
lisa simpson|please , dad .
lisa simpson|this argument humiliates us both .
lisa simpson|nothing , but you might say yes the ninetyninth time .
lisa simpson|please , dad .
lisa simpson|please , dad .
lisa simpson|please , dad .
lisa simpson|please , dad .
lisa simpson|please , dad .
lisa simpson|please , dad ^
lisa simpson|make it two .
lisa simpson|shaft .
lisa simpson|shaft .
lisa simpson|shut your mouth !
lisa simpson|i can dig it !
lisa simpson|john shaft .
lisa simpson|hi , dad .
lisa simpson|want me to cut out this infernal racket ?
lisa simpson|why ?
lisa simpson|why are we using the good china ?
lisa simpson|why are we waiting for dad ?
lisa simpson|dad , do something !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|how romantic .
lisa simpson|it's so hard to picture you two then .
lisa simpson|hand in hand at the crossroads of life .
lisa simpson|there are so many questions .
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|uh ^
lisa simpson|how did dad propose to you ?
lisa simpson|so , it was love at first sight .
lisa simpson|why you cagey ol' dog .
lisa simpson|everything i know tells me this story doesn't end with us sitting here , and you telling it to us .
lisa simpson|cable ?
lisa simpson|/ us ?
lisa simpson|/ wow !
lisa simpson|/ we have cable !
lisa simpson|dad , are you sure this isn't stealing ?
lisa simpson|mom , what are you doing ?
lisa simpson|well , don't you remember the eighth commandment ?
lisa simpson|thou shalt not steal !
lisa simpson|dad , why is the world such a cesspool of corruption ?
lisa simpson|well , at sunday school we learned that stealing is a sin .
lisa simpson|but everybody does it !
lisa simpson|i mean , we're stealing cable as we speak .
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|no , i didn't .
lisa simpson|dad , i think that's pretty spurious .
lisa simpson|so , even if a man takes bread to feed his starving family , that would be stealing ?
lisa simpson|i see .
lisa simpson|maybe .
lisa simpson|i don't watch him every minute .
lisa simpson|but what i am sure of is , we're getting cable for free .
lisa simpson|should i have my father arrested ?
lisa simpson|thank you , reverend lovejoy .
lisa simpson|hi , dad .
lisa simpson|i think stealing cable is wrong .
lisa simpson|so i'm choosing not to watch it in the hope that others will follow my example .
lisa simpson|it's the last you'll hear from me on the matter .
lisa simpson|thank you for your time .
lisa simpson|sorry , i'd rather go to heaven .
lisa simpson|i just want to call attention to the fact that i'm not watching this fight .
lisa simpson|it's my form of nonviolent protest .
lisa simpson|thanks , mom .
lisa simpson|it doesn't seem to be going very well .
lisa simpson|dad , we may have saved your soul .
lisa simpson|we're really proud of you , dad .
lisa simpson|go for it dad !
lisa simpson|poor brandy .
lisa simpson|aunt selma , do you think you'll ever get married ?
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|and , since i'm sure that you'd only resent the pity of an eightyearold niece , i'll simply hope that you're one of the statistically insignificant fortyyearold single women who ever find their fair prince .
lisa simpson|dad , bart ate a green bean during the blessing .
lisa simpson|eating is worse than opening eyes .
lisa simpson|is too .
lisa simpson|is too .
lisa simpson|is too .
lisa simpson|daad !
lisa simpson|we didn't say anything .
lisa simpson|a longlost halfbrother .

lisa simpson|gee , is it always this good ?
lisa simpson|bad dog !
lisa simpson|don't worry snowball .
lisa simpson|you're safe with me .
lisa simpson|mom , what will we do if santa's little helper doesn't learn anything in obedience school ?
lisa simpson|look , mom , i finished my patch .
lisa simpson|it depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life .
lisa simpson|on the left is mr largo , my music teacher at school .
lisa simpson|he taught me that even the noblest concerto can be drained of its beauty and soul .
lisa simpson|and on the right is bleeding gums murphy .
lisa simpson|he taught me that music is like a fire in your belly that comes out of your mouth , so you better stick an instrument in front of it .
lisa simpson|and look !
lisa simpson|i've suffered as much as anyone at the paws of this dog .
lisa simpson|but when i look into his vacant brown eyes , i just can't bear to let him go .
lisa simpson|i'm sure mom agrees with me .
lisa simpson|dad , this is our pet .
lisa simpson|we can question his integrity and disposition , but we can't question his heart .
lisa simpson|are you trying to teach us that the way to solve a problem with something you love is to throw it away ?
lisa simpson|yea !
lisa simpson|sewing a new quilt .
lisa simpson|you know , it's one thing to be a link in a chain .
lisa simpson|it's another to start one of your own .
lisa simpson|this patch commemorates the destruction of the old quilt .
lisa simpson|bart , he's not gonna learn it now .
lisa simpson|don't spend your last hours together tormenting the poor creature .
lisa simpson|have some fun , frolic with him .
lisa simpson|go get it , boy !
lisa simpson|huh uh , he smells more like a photo lab .
lisa simpson|to the pony rides .
lisa simpson|yes !
lisa simpson|that's gross .
lisa simpson|dad , it's just a dumb mud puddle .
lisa simpson|discount lion safari !
lisa simpson|discount lion safari !
lisa simpson|do not feed animals .
lisa simpson|do not allow animals in the car .
lisa simpson|do not make eye contact with animals .
lisa simpson|it seems that most of the animals are sleeping .
lisa simpson|yeah , bart , get out and push .
lisa simpson|challenge accepted !
lisa simpson|grampa , that's the noblest thought that's ever been expressed at this table .
lisa simpson|i don't deserve it , grampa .
lisa simpson|no one here does .
lisa simpson|the people who deserve it are on the streets and they're in the slums .
lisa simpson|they're little children who need more library books and families who can't make ends meet .
lisa simpson|of course , if you really wanted to , you could buy me a pony .
lisa simpson|i'll name her princess and i'll ride her every day .
lisa simpson|this is a rather shameless promotion .
lisa simpson|me too .
lisa simpson|of course .
lisa simpson|will you take us to mt .
lisa simpson|splashmore ?
lisa simpson|thanks , dad .
lisa simpson|it is back .
lisa simpson|whoooooaaaa !
lisa simpson|mommy !
lisa simpson|i want my mommy !
lisa simpson|forgive us , dad , but it takes time to properly sugarcoat a response .
lisa simpson|mom , these are really good .
lisa simpson|while i know firsthand how fragile young talent is , i'd love to hear the particulars of how your gift was squashed .
lisa simpson|oh mom , i can't believe you gave up painting because of one smallminded art teacher .
lisa simpson|and what was ringo's response ?
lisa simpson|maybe you could take a class at springfield community college .
lisa simpson|my mother would like to enroll in painting from life , 2b .
lisa simpson|mom ^

lisa simpson|you don't understand .
lisa simpson|but when you really make him laugh , you can see these two teeth .
lisa simpson|i think they're called the eye teeth .
lisa simpson|i don't know if he had orthodontic work or what , but they're absolutely perfect .
lisa simpson|no , mom .
lisa simpson|this is different .
lisa simpson|i mean , this man makes you feel like there's nobody better .

lisa simpson|yes !
lisa simpson|yes , mr bergstrom ?
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|homework's not my father's specialty .
lisa simpson|not mine .
lisa simpson|unless the next word was burp , you didn't have to .
lisa simpson|oh , you'll never go broke appealing to the lowest common denominator .
lisa simpson|when ?
lisa simpson|places where my intelligence will be an asset , not a liability ?
lisa simpson|i believe everything you say , with your words , your body language and your semitic good looks .
lisa simpson|mr bergstrom !
lisa simpson|wow !
lisa simpson|ewww .
lisa simpson|gross .

bart simpson|but it's stale .

bart simpson|full of blood and gore and torture and guts and ^
bart simpson|two kid's tickets for the diversity kittens .
bart simpson|and murder and swears and brains and basements ^
bart simpson|and bones and saws and lungs and faces worn as hats ^
bart simpson|now you probably think sever five is a ripoff of sever four , but it's actually based on the rich history of hong kong torture films .
bart simpson|uhoh .
bart simpson|i'm sorry .
bart simpson|i guess having a little brother is more responsibility than i thought .
bart simpson|especially 'cause i thought it'd be no responsibility at all .

homer simpson|marge , i still would be married to you , but you would just be hotter .
homer simpson|that's exactly what it means .
homer simpson|and dondelinger took that life away from me .

homer simpson|huh ?
homer simpson|who said that ?

homer simpson|he's too busy socializing at cocktail parties and managing the affairs of the wayne foundation .
homer simpson|oh , look who thinks he's smarter than sauce .

homer simpson|but the supervising producing was the best i've ever seen .
homer simpson|bart , son , if i bought you that bike , you wouldn't appreciate it .

homer simpson|someday you'll understand that i'm just being a good dad .
homer simpson|why you little !
homer simpson|hm .
homer simpson|i never thought of fatherhood as something that could affect a kid .
homer simpson|son , i won't strangle you anymore , but i also won't get you that minibike .
homer simpson|wish i could , son .
homer simpson|i really wish i could .
homer simpson|bart's mad because he wanted me to buy him something but i didn't think it was the right thing to do .
homer simpson|marge , not in front of the refrigerator .
homer simpson|well in that case , lisa was using her solar calculator yesterday so i opened the drapes to let in more sun .
homer simpson|well , in season two , when sam got good grades , he got a very surprising reward .
homer simpson|and if you do it , son , you'll get the same .
homer simpson|that's great .

homer simpson|everybody wears clothes from the past and uses computers from the future !
homer simpson|okay , you win .
homer simpson|we don't have to be friends , but can we live on the fringes of your world ?
homer simpson|like those eels that eat whale poop ?

homer simpson|it's amazing how many things they can make taste like cheese .
homer simpson|oh yeah , baby , i'm drinking you down to your knees .

homer simpson|but , there was one thing i wasn't prepared for ^
homer simpson|bongo was happy .
homer simpson|without me .
homer simpson|he had become her dog .
homer simpson|well , that's just the way dogs are .
homer simpson|the most disloyal unfaithful creatures god ever made .
homer simpson|he still has my sweatshirt .
homer simpson|oh my god , dad ^
homer simpson|i owe you an apology .
homer simpson|you saved bongo .
homer simpson|i never understood that till now .
homer simpson|why would you think that , just because i put you in a home where they feed you dog food ?
homer simpson|okay , but i'm a little out of practice .
homer simpson|what flavor ?
homer simpson|if it doesn't matter , then i call snickers .
homer simpson|my dog .

homer simpson|what the hell was that ?
homer simpson|well , i've taken eight months off .
homer simpson|it's time to get back on the horse .
homer simpson|i guess despite all our socalled civilization , anarchy lurks around every corner , like a raciallydiverse street gang on a network cop show .
homer simpson|america can't collapse !
homer simpson|we're as powerful as ancient rome !
homer simpson|sweet .
homer simpson|oh my god !
homer simpson|this unsourced , undated video has convinced me beyond any doubt !
homer simpson|preppies ?
homer simpson|oh , i hate you guys !
homer simpson|always partying on deck with your docksiders while us townies are scrubbing the bilge !
homer simpson|it's based on nothing !
homer simpson|i'd slash my wrists !

homer simpson|i can't conceive of any .
homer simpson|don't worry .
homer simpson|i am very good at keeping secrets .
homer simpson|impending doom ^
homer simpson|honey , everything's fine .
homer simpson|there's nothing to worry about .
homer simpson|just go play your saxophone while you can .
homer simpson|secrets ?
homer simpson|i have no secrets !
homer simpson|just enjoy this golden time you will soon cling desperately to the memory of .
homer simpson|smell some bread !
homer simpson|typical sheeple .
homer simpson|maybe .
homer simpson|yeah , but i'll go home , weigh myself , and i'll have gained six pounds .
homer simpson|what's that about ?
homer simpson|i guess an open garage isn't the best hiding place .
homer simpson|i wish .
homer simpson|son , the best way to explain this is to show you some ageinappropriate movies .
homer simpson|so , what have you learned so far from our postapocalyptic movie marathon ?
homer simpson|hollywood has taught you well , my son .
homer simpson|now let's push play .
homer simpson|fridgeratorr !
homer simpson|do not question the wisdom of tom skerritt .
homer simpson|wow .
homer simpson|your end of the world is better than my during the world .
homer simpson|aw .
homer simpson|uh , listen , i've gotta know .
homer simpson|you're not just being nice to me because in a pinch you could make candles from my fat ?
homer simpson|it's okay .
homer simpson|i know what i am .
homer simpson|um ^
homer simpson|a lot of that stuff must've got lost in the move .
homer simpson|i want to tell you but i promised to keep it a secret .
homer simpson|it's very late in the marriage to tell me that .
homer simpson|i've hidden all our supplies behind a fake wall .
homer simpson|see ?
homer simpson|these are our bugout bags .
homer simpson|in here is everything we need to survive .
homer simpson|the looming kablooey .
homer simpson|creepy ?
homer simpson|marge , the apocalypse is coming .
homer simpson|maybe not tomorrow , maybe never , but it's coming ^
homer simpson|and soon .
homer simpson|there's no handle on this side !
homer simpson|the one thing i couldn't prepare for .
homer simpson|marge , this is it !
homer simpson|teotwawki !
homer simpson|uhhuh , where's the kids ?
homer simpson|boy , get in the car .
homer simpson|and say goodbye to your best friend forever .
homer simpson|this is my daughter .
homer simpson|she brings the gift of music to the new world .
homer simpson|baritone .
homer simpson|here's something to pass the endless time .
homer simpson|write down which celebrities were rumored to be gay for future generations .
homer simpson|society will not have to start from square one .
homer simpson|marge , when i started prepping for the end of the world , everyone laughed at me .
homer simpson|well , just because i imagined it doesn't make it any less true .
homer simpson|and now all those people are on their own .
homer simpson|if jesus had a gun he'd be alive today .
homer simpson|why do we have to shoot them at all ?
homer simpson|no !
homer simpson|i want to help the people who didn't prepare !
homer simpson|don't be silly , mary ellen .
homer simpson|now we're going to leave this place .
homer simpson|i'm sorry , bart i know you've made a bugout camp girlfriend ^
homer simpson|white rice or brown ?
homer simpson|so we'll take these supplies back to springfield where they're needed most .
homer simpson|hm .
homer simpson|i cut the wires to something .
homer simpson|okay , everybody , keep your eyes peeled for an unlit mile post marked twentythree of thirtysix or something .
homer simpson|if we miss it , we're dead .
homer simpson|how can that be ?
homer simpson|i took every last can of gas !
homer simpson|now , everyone relax and pretend we're about to be hit by a soft brick wall .
homer simpson|out of our way , corn !
homer simpson|the starving people of springfield are desperately in need of our delivery of canned corn , corn flakes , and flash frozen corn nibblets .
homer simpson|now to save these sorry souls from a life of anarchy , starvation , and having sex for procreation .
homer simpson|you got to watch a vhs copy of red dawn thirteen times .
homer simpson|stop complaining .
homer simpson|we can keep the shrimp deveiner though , right ?
homer simpson|good riddance .
homer simpson|when i found out shrimp cocktails had no alcohol , i really lost interest .
homer simpson|goodbye , my electrical friends .
homer simpson|i can't afford to use you , so i'm doing what any good american would do throw you away .
homer simpson|parking meter ?
homer simpson|and it still works !
homer simpson|this could come in handy .
homer simpson|but let me check that list of things marge said never to bring home .
homer simpson|dogs , cats , octopuses , octopi , octopuseseses ^
homer simpson|parking meter , you're workin' for me now .
homer simpson|lotta people at the dump today .
homer simpson|this is the easiest money i've ever made , lugging around a ninety pound parking meter !
homer simpson|it's not that kind !
homer simpson|all right , now to drag the meter to the next idiot .
homer simpson|oh god , my back !
homer simpson|suckers !
homer simpson|my discs are grinding !
homer simpson|easy money !
homer simpson|we're cool , right boy ?
homer simpson|now to sleep the sleep of the just .
homer simpson|i'm king of the bus station !
homer simpson|eat silver , copper !
homer simpson|stay with me , man .
homer simpson|stay with me .
homer simpson|no , no !
homer simpson|you're the first successful business i've ever run !
homer simpson|the pillows are safe at my workstation .
homer simpson|as for the quarters ^
homer simpson|well , i'm ashamed to tell you what i did .
homer simpson|how long have you been in there ?
homer simpson|woo hoo !
homer simpson|and i wish that mr teeny gets a banana ^
homer simpson|that the isotopes emerge from this season with a great blooper reel ^
homer simpson|i wish that wishing wells worked so i wasn't just tossing my money away ^
homer simpson|and that marge loves me forever no matter what stupid things i do ^
homer simpson|way to get us back on topic , marge .
homer simpson|you live like this ?
homer simpson|dear lord , if thy tornado must take me , please let it take me to oz , but don't let flanders be the scarecrow !
homer simpson|we made it , boy !
homer simpson|oh my god .
homer simpson|oh my god .
homer simpson|this counts as a walk !
homer simpson|the tornado took old what'shisname !
homer simpson|i'm going after him !
homer simpson|lenny , take us with you to find our dog !
homer simpson|it's okay , marge , they're professionals .
homer simpson|hey !
homer simpson|maybe the last words i'll ever write .
homer simpson|maybe !
homer simpson|look , you guys obviously know about weather , but i understand something much more predictable women .
homer simpson|what women really want is a guy who's confident enough to go completely downhill after marriage and know she'll still love him .
homer simpson|that is the stupidest ^
homer simpson|i would never do that .
homer simpson|fine .
homer simpson|but i swear i will win you back from lenny .
homer simpson|help me , god !
homer simpson|what is it i'm paying you for every sunday ?
homer simpson|can always use ^
homer simpson|a good babysitter .
homer simpson|he was a black guy but his voice sounded like a white guy .
homer simpson|yes , it won't give !
homer simpson|found another one .
homer simpson|were you worried about me , boy ?
homer simpson|clearly the boy's in shock .
homer simpson|stop being blasé !
homer simpson|now i know you kids are scared by what happened , but it's bedtime .
homer simpson|just go into your dark rooms and shut your eyes .
homer simpson|connecticut ?
homer simpson|okay , you're right .
homer simpson|it's hard to imagine anyone else bringing up our kids , but i think the choice is obvious my dad .
homer simpson|good point .
homer simpson|we'll find somebody else .
homer simpson|i got it , dad .
homer simpson|oh yeah ?
homer simpson|the tornado was more of a father to me than you !
homer simpson|okay , how about my brother ?
homer simpson|he's rich .
homer simpson|oh , how very kind of you .
homer simpson|i am not giving our kids to these gravellyvoiced super hags !
homer simpson|one lump , please .
homer simpson|that's some impressive flutenastics .
homer simpson|goodbye forever !
homer simpson|all right , marge .
homer simpson|maybe we're being a little too choosy about who our kids spend the rest of their lives with .
homer simpson|we'll take what we can get .
homer simpson|kids , there's nothing to worry about ^
homer simpson|but we're looking at replacements for your mom and me if we should fail to die together as a family .
homer simpson|this is not that !
homer simpson|and that smartalecky attitude is exactly why no one wants you !
homer simpson|okay , i'll nudge 'em with the car .
homer simpson|we'll get a whole meet cute thing going .
homer simpson|wait !
homer simpson|what about that couple ?
homer simpson|they look pretty cozy .
homer simpson|wowww .
homer simpson|your house is perfect .
homer simpson|no sharp corners , no unsafe balconies , a cool grampa ^
homer simpson|ooh , thanks , dad .
homer simpson|wow .
homer simpson|i assumed the jackson five were the only perfect family , but now i see there's another .
homer simpson|uh , say , listen , portia .
homer simpson|how would you and mav feel about ^
homer simpson|um , swinging ?
homer simpson|no , no , no .
homer simpson|i meant pushing kids on swings .
homer simpson|okay , take whatever time you need .
homer simpson|i just want to know if you'd like to be their guardians .
homer simpson|man , you sure can talk surfer talk .
homer simpson|maybe this'll help you make up your mind .
homer simpson|you never know when you might wanna mail something .
homer simpson|worrywart marge .
homer simpson|you don't look a trojan horse in the mouth .
homer simpson|i swear to you , marge , when i have the time , i will google them both .
homer simpson|oh , uh , well , he wanted to be here , but i'm gonna decrease the volume of my voice and mumble so you can't really understand what i'm saying ^
homer simpson|great .
homer simpson|and now my dad can notarize .
homer simpson|name another .
homer simpson|now i can finally complete my bucket list .
homer simpson|too late !
homer simpson|you already signed !
homer simpson|oh wait , there's one more .
homer simpson|suckers !
homer simpson|oh wait , you've gotta initial this .
homer simpson|check mate .
homer simpson|hey , if they can watch 'em for the rest of their lives they can certainly do it for a weekend .
homer simpson|marge , no indulgence of mine ever becomes a habit .
homer simpson|it helps me write .
homer simpson|marge , this has been great couples time .
homer simpson|the one thing people with kids desperately need is no kids !
homer simpson|i don't like the way they just rip the paper off .
homer simpson|santa's little helper my ass .
homer simpson|no one steals my kids ^
homer simpson|except me ^
homer simpson|from that theme park jail ^
homer simpson|that i never told you about ^
homer simpson|except i guess i just did ^
homer simpson|we're all caught up now ^
homer simpson|let's go !
homer simpson|like all childless couples , they troll the beaches waiting for the egglayers to wander off from their young .
homer simpson|oh yeah , man .
homer simpson|don't worry , marge .
homer simpson|we'll get 'em .
homer simpson|unless we die on this icy mountain road .
homer simpson|then they've won forever .
homer simpson|women and their horrible thoughts .
homer simpson|marge , let me set your mind straight about something that spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids .
homer simpson|but those kids are ours , because we made them , by accident .
homer simpson|and now , we're gonna take them back because we love them , especially now that we've had a little time apart from them .
homer simpson|i've got a bone to pick with you !
homer simpson|then , an apology to make .
homer simpson|then , we exchange insurance information .
homer simpson|then , more bone picking !
homer simpson|those better be good breaks .
homer simpson|sure you wanted the fun parts , but do you want to go to their little league games and recitals ?
homer simpson|well , i'm glad someone has .
homer simpson|we've won .
homer simpson|woo hoo .
homer simpson|instead of concentrating on dying , we're going to concentrate on living .
homer simpson|why you little ^
homer simpson|i do call this living !
homer simpson|living the way kids in india can only dream of !
homer simpson|i win !
homer simpson|i forget .
homer simpson|ladies , please !
homer simpson|you can boss me around , just one at a time !
homer simpson|what the ?
homer simpson|finally !
homer simpson|a supervisor !
homer simpson|thank god i wore the underwear with the hole on the side .
homer simpson|if you're lucky , me , then this .
homer simpson|listen to your sister , boy .
homer simpson|what are you talkin' about ?
homer simpson|marge and i are goin' great .
homer simpson|it was during happy hour .
homer simpson|don't you want our baby to be happy ?
homer simpson|how can something that applies to bart apply to me ?
homer simpson|i'm so much older and wiser .
homer simpson|why you little ^
homer simpson|i'll teach you to say something that sounds similar !
homer simpson|you told me it was up to me if i wanted to go !
homer simpson|i am sick and tired of trying to decode you like you're some kind of human being separate from myself !
homer simpson|finally , we're gettin' somewhere .
homer simpson|hand me my suitcase , boy .
homer simpson|when you're older .
homer simpson|you're saying it like it happens all the time .
homer simpson|and by the way , the paint's a little faded on my parking spot .
homer simpson|you call this a platinum club experience ?
homer simpson|i've told you a thousand times , call me homer !
homer simpson|standard hotel boilerplate .
homer simpson|it just says somebody died in this room in the last seventytwo hours .
homer simpson|oh , it'll happen again , son .
homer simpson|knock yourself out .
homer simpson|not again !
homer simpson|i had this idea years ago ^
homer simpson|but your mother wouldn't let me do it .
homer simpson|shows how much she ^
homer simpson|knooooows !
homer simpson|it's hurting my eyes !
homer simpson|you know what we need ?
homer simpson|a classic kicked outta the house party .
homer simpson|now who's got a rockin' cd ?
homer simpson|that's it ?
homer simpson|well , then let's power this party up !
homer simpson|this calls for decisive action like l .
homer simpson|b .
homer simpson|j .
homer simpson|'s use of the period of mourning following the assassination to push through the civil rights act .
homer simpson|the same way hollywood does , by watching british movies !
homer simpson|agreed , but to win back our women we need to make a grand romantic gesture .
homer simpson|after we finish watching the movie .
homer simpson|marge you will get the last pork chop ^
homer simpson|and i promise to do the things i checked off within a year .
homer simpson|i think it's a terence malick movie .
homer simpson|finally , a kids' show that isn't trying to sell you something .
homer simpson|which reminds me , we need to order more rectangles .
homer simpson|honey , this sounds like a noble experiment , but like prohibition , it will end in a hail of bullets .
homer simpson|i'm on it .
homer simpson|if i buy you , why do i need all these books ?
homer simpson|spot the hidden objects .
homer simpson|boy , you're pretty pushy for a book i just met .

homer simpson|okay , now to see if i can apply my book knowledge to the real world .
homer simpson|got 'em !
homer simpson|sure , what do i care ?
homer simpson|whatever you say , sir .
homer simpson|sometimes it's just so nice to have a man take charge .
homer simpson|grownups have their reasons !
homer simpson|but i just did that !
homer simpson|marge , can i get a subscription to highlights magazine ?
homer simpson|where does it say that ?

homer simpson|it's gonna be yes , but don't rush me .
homer simpson|son , promise you will never look like me .
homer simpson|why you little !
homer simpson|that's not a heartwarming thing to end on !
homer simpson|i can't believe you're reading when there's so much great stuff on tv .
homer simpson|writing is for bathroom walls , and acting is for getting out of dui's .
homer simpson|the only reason tv exists is for reality shows about whitetrash scuzzbags doing subhuman , madeup jobs .
homer simpson|ooo !
homer simpson|jail music !
homer simpson|i'll give it one marathon .
homer simpson|no one feels out a unit like cj !
homer simpson|not bubba , not debbie and danny , no one !

homer simpson|uhoh , better put on my game shades .
homer simpson|one thousand dollars !
homer simpson|in the money game , cash is king .
homer simpson|you won't be laughing when these boxes are full of priceless treasures .
homer simpson|feather boas ?
homer simpson|tights ?
homer simpson|robes ?
homer simpson|this stupid locker must have belonged to some old lady .
homer simpson|why would my mandad have lady stuff ?
homer simpson|beefcake mags ?
homer simpson|that's insane !
homer simpson|my dad was married to a woman ^
homer simpson|who left him ^
homer simpson|because he ignored her needs for decades .
homer simpson|my gay dad is gay for gays .
homer simpson|those are pretty cute ^
homer simpson|my dad's always been so angry .
homer simpson|maybe if we help him be who he is , he'll finally be happy .
homer simpson|yeah .
homer simpson|gay rights are human rights , baby .
homer simpson|it's okay , dad .
homer simpson|we know the truth , and we love you .
homer simpson|just admit who you are , and you can find new love .
homer simpson|no fatties !
homer simpson|fine .
homer simpson|if i can't find my father a man to kiss and cuddle , then i've failed as a son .
homer simpson|then how do you explain this ?
homer simpson|who ?
homer simpson|look at all this wrestling stuff .
homer simpson|what's wrong ?
homer simpson|you were a worldfamous wrestler ?
homer simpson|spill the beans , old man .
homer simpson|word beans !
homer simpson|those things ?
homer simpson|i don't know .
homer simpson|should i really let the men who ruined my past and present hang out with the kid who's going to ruin my future ?
homer simpson|text me the choices .
homer simpson|apparently , old folks homes are full of people that used to be things .
homer simpson|just like you and me .
homer simpson|swear to god .
homer simpson|fine .

homer simpson|you've endured barbarian invasions , total financial collapse , and a lesbian prime minister .
homer simpson|you've managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs .
homer simpson|and to do that , you have to be stubborn .
homer simpson|but i ask you to put aside your stubbornness while i tell you about carl carlson ^
homer simpson|it doesn't matter what happened a thousand years ago .
homer simpson|for carl carlson's honor has been redeemed by the deeds of carl carlson .

homer simpson|this dude gets it .
homer simpson|i don't know what you're talking about .
homer simpson|hide the treasure !

homer simpson|i would feel a .
homer simpson|happy for their good fortune , b .
homer simpson|proud to know rich people , and c .
homer simpson|grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake .
homer simpson|then they'll just be mad about the sixtyfive percent that we're keeping !
homer simpson|marge , you like kindness , right ?
homer simpson|so even if we gave kirk and luann some of money , the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them , like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti .
homer simpson|homer looks into marge's eyes .

homer simpson|what'll it take to buy your silence ?

homer simpson|a money cushion .
homer simpson|no more living paycheck to paycheck , one lost retainer away from the gutter .
homer simpson|that's the cushion .
homer simpson|don't worry .
homer simpson|no one's gonna see this stupid show .
homer simpson|you have no obligation to share the money from that painting .
homer simpson|ooo , a support rock !
homer simpson|just close your eyes and think of the cushion .
homer simpson|the paddles , marge !
homer simpson|look at the paddles !
homer simpson|our cushion !
homer simpson|excuse me , we're trying to find café artiste .
homer simpson|i guess i can't help but feel fully responsible .
homer simpson|what you need , my friend , is a canadian duff .
homer simpson|beauty , eh ?
homer simpson|so , why does that chick think she owns the painting ?
homer simpson|not your fault , man .
homer simpson|those parasailing guys take whatever they want .
homer simpson|okay , all i gotta do is take a quick ferry to isla verde , find café artiste , and they'll back up kirk's story .

homer simpson|i wish i knew how .
homer simpson|yeah , yeah , yeah .
homer simpson|just remember , if your mother asks , i took you to a wine tasting .
homer simpson|that's why she'll believe it .

homer simpson|that proves the painting is mine !
homer simpson|and nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money !
homer simpson|i love art !
homer simpson|who ?
homer simpson|prove it .
homer simpson|oh ^
homer simpson|crap .
homer simpson|then why did the auction house say it was real ?
homer simpson|now let's play human foosball !
homer simpson|what if i never liked the painting , and only wanted it for money ?
homer simpson|oh , great .
homer simpson|the painting is worthless ^
homer simpson|this was all for nothing .
homer simpson|and when marge finds out she's gonna kill me .
homer simpson|while you're at it ^
homer simpson|could you make me a couple more ?
homer simpson|i'll pay you in strupo ^
homer simpson|marge , it happened again !
homer simpson|loser .

homer simpson|stig .
homer simpson|you've got a name that's not a name .

homer simpson|music !
homer simpson|beautiful music !
homer simpson|beautiful music , baby .
homer simpson|sure it is .
homer simpson|you know i've always loved laying things down .
homer simpson|grooves are just the latest .
homer simpson|i feel a powerful connection to the history of famous bass players .
homer simpson|like what's his name from the who .
homer simpson|or that guy from led zeppelin who wasn't page , plant or bonham .
homer simpson|those are the only two i know for sure .
homer simpson|oh yeah , and you know what's the great thing is about music ?
homer simpson|it's so easy .
homer simpson|so easy .
homer simpson|i don't know guys .
homer simpson|i'm not sure i'm feeling this .
homer simpson|the bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument .
homer simpson|i almost forgot the most important thing .
homer simpson|great practice , guys .
homer simpson|what do you say we give it another six hours then call it a day ?
homer simpson|oh ^
homer simpson|yeah , apu , i'm sure you're a great singer .
homer simpson|but the balance of the band is really delicate right now , and we're not really looking for a world music vibe .
homer simpson|no disrespect to world music .
homer simpson|i love world music .
homer simpson|that sounds nothing like terrible , terrible world music .
homer simpson|guys , are you feeling this ?
homer simpson|are you feeling this ?
homer simpson|we are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families .
homer simpson|we are now a cover band .
homer simpson|and we shall be called ^
homer simpson|covercraft .
homer simpson|because we play covers and this is our craft .
homer simpson|that was not my intent .
homer simpson|okay , covercraft hands in .
homer simpson|cover ^
homer simpson|r o k c .
homer simpson|okay , this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new .
homer simpson|apu , what's wrong ?
homer simpson|i still want one .
homer simpson|buddy , buddy .
homer simpson|think of it this way you're not singing in front of all those people , you're alone at the kwikemart in the middle of the night .
homer simpson|you just wear this on stage , and everything will be fine .
homer simpson|well son , i do have the talent my mind is full of ideas for great songs i could write ^
homer simpson|down the names of and then cover .
homer simpson|but then i remember i'm just a regular guy , jamming with my buds .
homer simpson|yep .
homer simpson|it's all about the music ^
homer simpson|and it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that .
homer simpson|pretty unforeseen ^
homer simpson|guys , i really need your honesty here .
homer simpson|at the squidport senior jamboree ^
homer simpson|was i too in the pocket ?
homer simpson|how ?
homer simpson|what kind of erotic asphyxiation ?
homer simpson|oh ^
homer simpson|i think i can answer for apu .
homer simpson|he's flattered , but the smalltime success of covercraft is all that any of us have ever wanted .
homer simpson|not me .
homer simpson|i'm nothing but happy that our friend is headed for fame and fortune .
homer simpson|i want his fame and fortune so much !
homer simpson|why must the lords of rock be so cruel ?
homer simpson|sammy hagar ?
homer simpson|you're not dead .
homer simpson|it's something you make sketches about .
homer simpson|i'm not jealous .
homer simpson|i'm envious .
homer simpson|jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have .
homer simpson|envy is wanting what someone else has .
homer simpson|what i feel is envy .
homer simpson|you know what ?
homer simpson|apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band .
homer simpson|we're gonna be like genesis after peter gabriel left .
homer simpson|phil collinsera genesis is not as good , huh ?
homer simpson|no reply at all , land of confusion , throwing it all away , illegal alien , i can't dance , and i'm sure i don't need to mention ^
homer simpson|invisible touch !
homer simpson|what ?
homer simpson|so you can also get famous and bail on us ?
homer simpson|you're out of the band !
homer simpson|oh , so you're sticking up for yoko here ?

homer simpson|yoko !
homer simpson|yoko !
homer simpson|yoko !
homer simpson|yoko !
homer simpson|yoko !
homer simpson|all you yokos are out of the band !
homer simpson|do i sound okay ?
homer simpson|they're not juicy .
homer simpson|my licks are dry .
homer simpson|dry and scratchy like a cat's tongue .
homer simpson|well it's not enough anymore .
homer simpson|when something great happens to one person , everyone else's life gets a little worse .
homer simpson|look it up , it's called physics .
homer simpson|oh , you mean he generously invited us to come watch him be a rock star ?
homer simpson|i'll never have a per diem .
homer simpson|apu wouldn't be able to sing a note if i didn't help him get over his stage fright with his kwikemart shirt ^
homer simpson|backstage pass , you just became a payback rage pass .
homer simpson|look at all this rock star dressing room stuff .
homer simpson|what a sellout .
homer simpson|cheese plate oh , sorry , cubed cheese plate , lemon tea , probably for his throat ^
homer simpson|let's see how he performs in front of all those people without his magicpeopleperforminginfrontof shirt .
homer simpson|i'm sorry , apu .
homer simpson|i thought you were living your dream life , so naturally i wanted to ruin it .
homer simpson|but now i know things stink , so i'm okay with it .

homer simpson|not even enough to buy one beer .
homer simpson|wait a minute , lemme count and make sure ^
homer simpson|not even close .
homer simpson|dear family i am an utter failure and you'll be better off without me .
homer simpson|by the time you read this , i will be in my watery grave .
homer simpson|i can only leave you with the words my father gave me 'stand tall , have courage and never give up .
homer simpson|' i only hope i can provide a better model in death than i did in life .
homer simpson|warmest regards , love homer j .
homer simpson|simpson .
homer simpson|almost there .
homer simpson|hey , you idiot !
homer simpson|watch where you're going !
homer simpson|well , live and learn .
homer simpson|boy , this intersection is dangerous !
homer simpson|someone ought to put a stop sign here .
homer simpson|kill myself ?
homer simpson|killing myself is the last thing i'd ever do .
homer simpson|now i have a purpose , a reason to live .
homer simpson|i don't care who i have to face .
homer simpson|i don't care who i have to fight .
homer simpson|i will not rest until this street gets a stop sign .
homer simpson|ladies and gentlemen , esteemed councilmen , boys and girls , retired people with nothing better to do .
homer simpson|i think we should put a stop sign at d street and twelfth .
homer simpson|wow .
homer simpson|they listened to me .
homer simpson|hey , if they think i'm gonna stop at that stop sign , they're sadly mistaken .
homer simpson|proud .
homer simpson|proud of what ?
homer simpson|ah , what a great family !
homer simpson|but come on , we all know this is small potatoes .
homer simpson|there is a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together .
homer simpson|i'm talking about that !
homer simpson|what did you say , son ?
homer simpson|that's okay .
homer simpson|i'll just assume you said what i thought i heard you say .
homer simpson|thank you .
homer simpson|unlike most of you , i am not a nut .
homer simpson|just a good , honest american who opposes wrongdoing and especially carelessness wherever they occur .
homer simpson|our lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or i .
homer simpson|many of them , incompetent boobs .
homer simpson|i know this because i have worked along side them , gone bowling with them , watched them pass me over for promotions time and again .
homer simpson|and i say , this stinks !
homer simpson|privately ?
homer simpson|stay here , i'll be right back .
homer simpson|same here .
homer simpson|sorry , no can do !
homer simpson|safety ?
homer simpson|but , sir , if truth be known , i actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee .
homer simpson|there were even a few doozies no one ever found out about .
homer simpson|hey !
homer simpson|what's the problem here ?
homer simpson|me in charge of safety ?
homer simpson|this place could blow skyhigh .
homer simpson|nah .
homer simpson|i'll concentrate on my work now .
homer simpson|gee , this guy's desk sure is big .
homer simpson|i can't let marge support the family .
homer simpson|this guy's got the cleanest shirt i've ever seen .
homer simpson|what should i ^
homer simpson|umm ^
homer simpson|what the hey .
homer simpson|i'll take the job .
homer simpson|what ?
homer simpson|oh , sit tight .
homer simpson|i'll be right back .
homer simpson|i can't do it , mr burns .
homer simpson|hmm .
homer simpson|when you put it that way , it does sound a little farfetched .
homer simpson|but that's the lug you're looking at .
homer simpson|and i vow to continue spending every free minute i have crusading for safety .
homer simpson|of course , i'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job .
homer simpson|i'll get to work .
homer simpson|but first i have to say goodbye to some friends .
homer simpson|friends , you have come to depend on me as your safety watchdog so you won't scrape yourself or stub your toes or blow yourselves up , but you can't depend on me all your lives .
homer simpson|you have to learn that there's a little homer simpson in all of us .
homer simpson|and i'm gonna have to live with out your respect and awe .
homer simpson|the only reason i'm telling you this is i'm going to be leaving you .
homer simpson|but , don't worry .
homer simpson|i've just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant ^
homer simpson|with a big fat raise !
homer simpson|whoa !
homer simpson|easy !
homer simpson|don't drop me !
homer simpson|be careful .

homer simpson|so , what's the problem , son ?
homer simpson|come on , marge .
homer simpson|i don't bug you when you're helping lisa .
homer simpson|what ?
homer simpson|and violate the code of the school yard ?
homer simpson|i'd rather bart died .
homer simpson|the code of the school yard , marge !
homer simpson|the rules that teach a boy to be a man .
homer simpson|let's see ^
homer simpson|don't tattle ^
homer simpson|always make fun of those different from you ^
homer simpson|never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do ^

homer simpson|yeah , right !
homer simpson|this ought to be good for a laugh .
homer simpson|aw , marge .

homer simpson|no , no !
homer simpson|not like that !
homer simpson|like this !
homer simpson|see , that boy ?
homer simpson|you didn't expect that , did you ?
homer simpson|and neither will he .
homer simpson|unfortunately , son , we simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own .
homer simpson|so the next time this bully thinks you're gonna throw a punch , you throw a glob of mud in his eyes , and then you sock him when he's staggering around , blinded ^
homer simpson|and there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned .
homer simpson|and if you get the chance , get 'em right in the family jewels .
homer simpson|that little doozy's been a simpson trademark for generations .

homer simpson|and you know something , folks ?
homer simpson|as ridiculous as it sounds , i would rather feel the sweet breath of my beautiful wife on the back of my neck as i sleep than stuff dollar bills into some stranger's gstring .

homer simpson|hey , you did it !

homer simpson|it's being one of those guys who sits in a bar telling the story of how he became a loser .
homer simpson|and i never want that to happen to me .
homer simpson|well , okay .
homer simpson|it all started on nuclear plant employees , spouses , and no more than three children night , down at springfield stadium .
homer simpson|you know , boy , some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues , one day .

homer simpson|lisa , honey , you're forgetting the beer .
homer simpson|it comes in seventytwo ounce tubs here .
homer simpson|what are you getting at ?
homer simpson|marge , this ticket doesn't just give me a seat , it also gives me the right no , the duty , to make a complete ass of myself .

homer simpson|good one , sir .
homer simpson|little baby batter / can't control his bladder !

homer simpson|come on , get up !
homer simpson|your team needs you !
homer simpson|c'mon !
homer simpson|as i got up in front of them , i felt an intoxication that had nothing to do with alcohol .
homer simpson|it was the intoxication of being a public spectacle .
homer simpson|i thank you .
homer simpson|you're too kind .
homer simpson|glad you enjoyed it , but i can't take all the credit .
homer simpson|the batter did his part , too .
homer simpson|m me ?
homer simpson|a mascot for a bush league team ?
homer simpson|i should have slept on it .
homer simpson|or at least stared blankly for a while .
homer simpson|perhaps if i'd been unable to think of a nickname , all our lives might have been spared .
homer simpson|well , i'm ready to punch in .
homer simpson|nope , this was my own bright idea .
homer simpson|c'mon , we gotta hurry .
homer simpson|don't fill up on those vegetables , kids .
homer simpson|save room for your nachos .

homer simpson|you make me sick .
homer simpson|me ?
homer simpson|in the majors ?
homer simpson|wait a minute , capital city has a mascot .
homer simpson|the greatest mascot there is the capital city goofball .
homer simpson|i'll say !
homer simpson|because they might say no .
homer simpson|this was the biggest decision the simpsons ever faced .
homer simpson|i should've listened to the kids instead of my big dumb wife .
homer simpson|i shouldn't have called her that .
homer simpson|bite my tongue .
homer simpson|bite my tongue .
homer simpson|oooh .
homer simpson|it won't be so bad .
homer simpson|you'll die someplace else .
homer simpson|phfft .
homer simpson|you'll make new and better friends .
homer simpson|you mean ?
homer simpson|it's not that simple .
homer simpson|i've got to convince my supervisor to give me a leave of absence .
homer simpson|that's right , ned .
homer simpson|oh , knock it off , flanders !
homer simpson|don't start blubbering on me .
homer simpson|i'm gonna miss you too ^
homer simpson|not .
homer simpson|some may say that i have been given a bad break in life little education , bald as a cue ball , ten years on the same job for the same salary but today , as i leave for capital city , i consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the earth !
homer simpson|with the fickle fans already forgetting me , i was ready to take the biggest step of my life .
homer simpson|well kids , there it is , capital city .
homer simpson|wow !
homer simpson|kids , look !
homer simpson|street crime !
homer simpson|wow !
homer simpson|that's service !
homer simpson|the duff brewery !
homer simpson|sorry , honey .
homer simpson|i'm just a little nervous .
homer simpson|we would talk about it always .
homer simpson|for the first time in our lives , marge fell asleep before i did .
homer simpson|okay , here are your tickets .
homer simpson|they're supposed to be good .
homer simpson|you're sitting with the player's wives .
homer simpson|and don't forget to cheer for me .
homer simpson|bart was strangely quiet .
homer simpson|later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me .
homer simpson|that wouldn't last .
homer simpson|wow .
homer simpson|omigod !
homer simpson|i don't believe it .
homer simpson|it's really you , the capital city goofball .
homer simpson|wow , the fifth .
homer simpson|right , mr goofball .
homer simpson|well , i get up , i dance , i spell out the name of the city ^
homer simpson|all to the tune of baby elephant walk .
homer simpson|who'd've thought it ?
homer simpson|a free ticket to a big league park but i was too tense to enjoy the game .
homer simpson|every ounce of concentration i possessed was focused on the task at hand .
homer simpson|oooh , red hots .
homer simpson|mmm , these do taste better at the ballpark .
homer simpson|uh oh .
homer simpson|i was graceful .
homer simpson|i was witty .
homer simpson|brother , i was somethin' .
homer simpson|but they didn't care .
homer simpson|it was so quiet you could hear each individual smartass remark .
homer simpson|the only applause i got was for dragging my carcass out of there .
homer simpson|what a family .
homer simpson|my wife and kids stood by me .
homer simpson|on the way home i realized how little that helped .
homer simpson|so that's it .
homer simpson|the costume's buried now .
homer simpson|as my son would say , i'm one sad apelike dude .
homer simpson|hey , you guys are hanging on my every word .
homer simpson|i've become the center of attention .
homer simpson|okay .
homer simpson|i wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular .
homer simpson|bust my hump all week ^
homer simpson|stupid grass ^

homer simpson|h'lo , flanders .
homer simpson|who told ?
homer simpson|marge !
homer simpson|beer me !
homer simpson|crabgrass ?
homer simpson|what are you talking about ?
homer simpson|where ?

homer simpson|uh ^
homer simpson|elfgrass .
homer simpson|marge !
homer simpson|where's the duff ?

homer simpson|well , beggars can't be choosy .
homer simpson|all right , knock it off !
homer simpson|you've been rubbing my nose in it since i got here .
homer simpson|your family is better than my family .
homer simpson|your beer comes from farther away than my beer .
homer simpson|you and your son like each other .
homer simpson|your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt .
homer simpson|you make me sick !
homer simpson|i wouldn't stay on a bet !
homer simpson|one for the road .

homer simpson|it wasn't how he said it either , but the message was loud and clear ^
homer simpson|our family stinks !
homer simpson|oh , he's perfect now , is he ?
homer simpson|no , no , marge .
homer simpson|don't backpedal .
homer simpson|you were right the first time .
homer simpson|he's perfect .
homer simpson|perfect in every way .
homer simpson|i'm just gonna go take a walk around the block to calm down .
homer simpson|i got a little excited .
homer simpson|i'm not perfect ^
homer simpson|like ned flanders .

homer simpson|too bad we don't live on a farm .
homer simpson|let's go , boy .

homer simpson|come on , baby , pleeze pleeze go in .
homer simpson|pleeze .
homer simpson|flanders !

homer simpson|yeah , he's entering and what's more , he's going to win , aren't you , boy ?
homer simpson|oh yeah !

homer simpson|okay , that didn't work .
homer simpson|this time move your head and don't follow through .
homer simpson|what're you doing ?
homer simpson|that putter is to you what a bat is to a baseball player , what a violin is to the guy tha ^

homer simpson|now , c'mon , give your putter a name .
homer simpson|come on , give it a name .
homer simpson|do you wanna try a little harder , son ?
homer simpson|come on , give it a girl's name .
homer simpson|your putter's name is charlene !
homer simpson|it just is .
homer simpson|that's why .
homer simpson|now , this is a picture of your enemy , todd flanders .
homer simpson|every day i want you to spend fifteen minutes staring at it and concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and charlene annihilate him .
homer simpson|i'll show you who charlene is !
homer simpson|now start hating !
homer simpson|and ?
homer simpson|but , marge , this is our big chance to show up the flanderses .
homer simpson|because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making someone else look bad .
homer simpson|and i'm tired of making other people feel good about themselves .

marge simpson|like queen elizabeth the first !
marge simpson|she had it all , except the most important thing .
marge simpson|no , a husband !
marge simpson|the year was 1588 .
marge simpson|four hundred years before kirk gibson would hit his famous home run .
marge simpson|queen elizabeth ruled over all of england .
marge simpson|every eligible bachelor in europe wanted her hand in marriage .
marge simpson|lisa , you are going to look so pretty .
marge simpson|and she lived happily ever after ?
marge simpson|that's nice .
marge simpson|all i have are some drycleaning coupons .
marge simpson|lisa , let me tell you the story of a great woman held back by a notsogreat husband .
marge simpson|macbeth !
marge simpson|out , damn'd spot !
marge simpson|out , i say !
marge simpson|i wouldn't be stuck washing costumes if my husband had a better role .
marge simpson|i thought i was marrying a man who could play macbeth .
marge simpson|i think mel would be happier as an understudy .
marge simpson|a sixfeetunderstudy .
marge simpson|wouldst thou live a coward in thine own esteem , letting i dare not wait upon i would ?
marge simpson|tonight the springfield community playhouse was bathed in the light of a brilliant new star ^
marge simpson|dr hibbert as banquo ?
marge simpson|he's the one getting the good reviews !
marge simpson|which makes him the next one you've got to kill .
marge simpson|screw your courage to the stickingplace and we'll not fail .
marge simpson|macbeth !
marge simpson|in last night's 'macbeth , ' the best performance was barney gumbel as duncan , followed by duffman as macduff , lenny leonard as lennox , eddie and lou as the two soldiers without lines , then last and least , the lead , homer simpson .
marge simpson|all i heard was more names of actors you haven't killed .
marge simpson|unless you're not man enough .
marge simpson|why did he have to kill everyone in their costumes ?
marge simpson|no , it was homer !
marge simpson|no , i just encouraged him .
marge simpson|oh homie , you were brilliant .

marge simpson|titus andronicus ^
marge simpson|that's it , three stories .
marge simpson|that's what we always tell .
marge simpson|ooo , the fountainhead .
marge simpson|so , anyway , this is the story of maggie roarke , an architect who refused to compromise .
marge simpson|maggie's genius and creativity far exceeded that of the others .
marge simpson|and i'm not just saying that 'cause i'm her mother .
marge simpson|but her teacher , mr ellsworth toohey , wanted every child to conform .
marge simpson|maggie grew up to be a worldfamous architect .
marge simpson|her building became one of the wonders of the world .
marge simpson|and on the very top floor was a daycare center ^
marge simpson|where every child was free to follow their dream .
marge simpson|because nothing is ^
marge simpson|maggie !
marge simpson|get away from there !
marge simpson|bad baby !
marge simpson|guess who the garden club elected president ?
marge simpson|no .

marge simpson|what was that ?
marge simpson|ooh .
marge simpson|come and get me .
marge simpson|i think you may have put on a little weight .
marge simpson|i'm glad you've got such a stimulating substitute , but i'm worried about mrs krabappel .
marge simpson|yes !
marge simpson|i googled girls having fun , and after wading through ninetyseven thousand pages of porn , i found crazy bowling .
marge simpson|that's odd .
marge simpson|there isn't a single man in this whole bowling alley .

marge simpson|i'm glad your father isn't here to see this !
marge simpson|bart , let him go !

marge simpson|nelson , you really have a knack for this .
marge simpson|maybe someday you can do lisa's wedding !
marge simpson|this goes on for a while ^
marge simpson|call me a killjoy , but i think that because this is not to my taste , no one else should be able to enjoy it .
marge simpson|we need to take this into the belly of the beast .
marge simpson|mr scalper , give me a ticket .
marge simpson|i'm marge simpson and i will not rest until you tear down this septagon !
marge simpson|pleased to meet you , chett .
marge simpson|guys , please .
marge simpson|when you yell like that , no one can hear me .
marge simpson|chett , i'm here to ask you one simple thing please go out of business and donate all your profits to charity .
marge simpson|at least in other sports they're trying to put a ball in a net or a zone .
marge simpson|but in this sport they don't put anything in anything .
marge simpson|and if they did , i wouldn't want to see it !
marge simpson|really ?
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|that's crazy .
marge simpson|that flattens my soda pop !
marge simpson|you're on !
marge simpson|thank you , homie .
marge simpson|i can't back out .
marge simpson|this is for a cause that's bigger than i am .
marge simpson|if gandhi could go without eating for a whole threehour movie , i can do this .
marge simpson|besides , i'm a woman .
marge simpson|he'll probably go easy on me .
marge simpson|if i'm gonna open a can of whuptushy , i'd better get in shape , with some rhythmic gymnastics !

marge simpson|i'd just like to say one thing .
marge simpson|i only agreed to this fight because i wanted to stop the violence .
marge simpson|and sure i got into great shape and met some fun people , but i ended up discovering my own dark side .
marge simpson|so from now on , the only thing i'm fighting is this cold i'm coming down with .
marge simpson|well , i wish somebody would've stuck around to hear it .
marge simpson|where did they all go ?
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|let's go home .
marge simpson|we can enjoy some mixed marital arts .

marge simpson|i guess i could !
marge simpson|now lisa , you're a vegetarian , but these cows have made a different choice .
marge simpson|we don't have a panic room !
marge simpson|i can't shoot her .
marge simpson|she's lisa's godmother .
marge simpson|that was so noble of apu to give his life for us .
marge simpson|i don't see the safe zone anywhere .

marge simpson|if they keep overwhelming him , he might be turned off school forever .
marge simpson|it's okay , bart .
marge simpson|just do a couple vocabulary words , then come have some milk and cookies .
marge simpson|never mind what he said .
marge simpson|you just listen to me .
marge simpson|bart !

marge simpson|well , you always miss when you throw your underpants at the hamper !
marge simpson|you practiced all day on my birthday !
marge simpson|you were never going to apologize !
marge simpson|you're wrong !
marge simpson|and whenever you're wrong you just sprout gibberish .
marge simpson|i don't mind if you pee in the shower , but only if you're taking a shower !
marge simpson|well then there won't be any sex !
marge simpson|i just think when two people disagree , the big jerk ought to apologize .
marge simpson|i'm going to find my husband .
marge simpson|but don't depress the kids .
marge simpson|i'm sorry we ever fought .
marge simpson|till the two of us are back on track , bart can fend for himself .
marge simpson|it's working !

marge simpson|oh my god , homie we're having a real conversation !
marge simpson|nope .
marge simpson|mom and dad , bart is going to use the old subway to destroy springfield elementary !

marge simpson|homer , we've got to stop him !
marge simpson|we're going to have to be good parents to our son and work twice as hard on our marriage .
marge simpson|mister , you are grounded !
marge simpson|and i'm taking all the exciting colors out of your crayons !
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|i thought you were fixing my brakes !
marge simpson|you mean ^
marge simpson|he kissed her ?
marge simpson|why didn't you just tell him to club her on the head and drag her into a cave ?
marge simpson|thank you .
marge simpson|and it means the world to me .
marge simpson|that's not bart , it's principal skinner .
marge simpson|bart's sitting right next to you .
marge simpson|homer , i can hear your sarcasm from inside the house and the dishwasher's on !
marge simpson|what's going on here ?
marge simpson|ned flanders , you would take our family to the holy land just to try to make my husband a better man ?

marge simpson|but we insist on paying our own way .
marge simpson|and homer , put on some pants .
marge simpson|homie , just tell them what they wanna hear !
marge simpson|this country's so historic for all we know , jesus could have given a talk in conference room c .

marge simpson|what's he gonna do now ?
marge simpson|thanks , but you can stop giving the tour now .

marge simpson|eat it .
marge simpson|yes !
marge simpson|enjoy !
marge simpson|bon appétit !

marge simpson|you remember dylan .
marge simpson|you were in toddle tots together .
marge simpson|of course you do .
marge simpson|dylan's a ^
marge simpson|hm ^
marge simpson|let me check the invitation ^
marge simpson|fish theme !
marge simpson|that tells me nothing !
marge simpson|there's gotta be a clue here somewhere .
marge simpson|see ?
marge simpson|what kind of a party has two activities ?
marge simpson|they're just trying to confuse me .
marge simpson|i give up !
marge simpson|i hope dylan likes trucks .
marge simpson|dealing drugs ?
marge simpson|that's impossible .
marge simpson|he ^
marge simpson|he doesn't have the math skills !
marge simpson|bart ?
marge simpson|bart , are you here ?
marge simpson|that's drug talk !
marge simpson|but i could be mistaken .
marge simpson|let me just listen to a little more , out of context .
marge simpson|bart simpson , are you a drugo ?
marge simpson|well , can you explain what you were doing in the basement with milhouse ?
marge simpson|hey , that's pretty nifty .
marge simpson|let me try .
marge simpson|oh my gosh , that's adorable !
marge simpson|this one's going on the christmas tree .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|you have visitors .
marge simpson|come on , let's go !
marge simpson|what are you waiting for ?
marge simpson|come on .
marge simpson|it's making our meter run backwards !
marge simpson|my smoothie is a lumpy !
marge simpson|homie , maybe this is too much electricity .
marge simpson|our wedding china's ruined .
marge simpson|homie , can i talk to you for a second ?
marge simpson|homie , i happened to read about beached whales in springfield geographic .
marge simpson|it usually does not end well .
marge simpson|we can't let lisa get her hopes up .
marge simpson|lisa is very sensitive .
marge simpson|lisa , sweetheart it's almost dinnertime .
marge simpson|why don't you come home ?
marge simpson|tonight let's all draw pictures of what your father just said .
marge simpson|does he have a cute accent ?
marge simpson|oooh , he sounds just like paddington bear !
marge simpson|lisa , i know kids have been making fun of your blonde hair , so i got you this book from the being different section of the bookstore .
marge simpson|what is it , ned ?
marge simpson|should we inform the chief ?
marge simpson|i don't know ^
marge simpson|i'm starting to think we're prying too much into people's lives , and this room isn't really the best place for maggie to hang out .
marge simpson|that's not sesame street , that's a gay bar .
marge simpson|although i guess this would teach her sharing and caring , but ^
marge simpson|we're going home .
marge simpson|homer , maggie has to wear that clown mask for halloween .
marge simpson|what's going on ?
marge simpson|i don't see what's so wonderful .
marge simpson|ever hear of the expression not in my backyard ?
marge simpson|well , that !
marge simpson|i don't want to get homer in trouble , but it's just plain wrong to use that blind spot to turn our back yard into a mecca of misdemeanors !
marge simpson|you guys should go on that cruise .
marge simpson|you'll have a great time , and you kids can spend the day getting to know your father ^
marge simpson|and i can spend my mother's day taking care of something i've been putting off for a long time .
marge simpson|that's something you've been putting off .
marge simpson|why do i waste my breath ?
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|i'm you !
marge simpson|we're breaking up !
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer my mother's party's starting any minute .
marge simpson|get busy .
marge simpson|this is my mother's eightieth birthday party and you're not ruining it .
marge simpson|you'll have a good time .
marge simpson|i invited a friend for you .
marge simpson|every time i plan something that means something to me you somehow mess it up .
marge simpson|you said you'd be home by seven to help with my mother's birthday !
marge simpson|i'm still mad at you from last night .
marge simpson|what do you think ?
marge simpson|my mother explained that what happened at the party wasn't your fault .
marge simpson|homie , slow down !
marge simpson|now that it's empty , who's gonna buy their house ?
marge simpson|what if someone moves in with two barts ?
marge simpson|or four teenage barts ?
marge simpson|stop that sniffing !
marge simpson|it's not for you !
marge simpson|they're making the house next door smell like cookies so people will subconsciously want to buy it .
marge simpson|homer , no !
marge simpson|credenza , credenza , lowboy , sideboard , portmanteau ^
marge simpson|and where there's exotic fish , there's gotta be a ^
marge simpson|water feature ^
marge simpson|why on earth do you think that harmlesslooking man ^
marge simpson|is sideshow bob ?
marge simpson|a lot of people sound like sideshow bob , like frasier on cheers .
marge simpson|or lieutenant commander tom dodge in down periscope .
marge simpson|honey , his name is walt warren , and he's a very nice man .
marge simpson|he stopped me from driving away with my coffee cup on top of the car .
marge simpson|bart ?
marge simpson|what are you doing ?
marge simpson|you're indoors at an outdoor party !
marge simpson|it's probably a deboner .
marge simpson|i can see there's only one way to settle this once and for all .
marge simpson|thank you ^
marge simpson|you're very sweet ^
marge simpson|we better go .
marge simpson|guys , guys , i'm married !
marge simpson|the paper's here .
marge simpson|is your room clean ?
marge simpson|good .
marge simpson|that'll give me something to do while you're at the game .
marge simpson|but that's impossible !
marge simpson|if you're the real walt warren , who's taking our son to the baseball game right now ?
marge simpson|walt , why didn't you tell your story to the guards ?
marge simpson|you have to admit , bart simpson will die was kind of open to interpretation .
marge simpson|excuse me , have you seen this man ?
marge simpson|walt , it's a nice face , but i don't think it would drive a professional waitress to lie .
marge simpson|homer , can we please find bart ?
marge simpson|well , whoever moves in , it can't be worse than having a murderer next door .
marge simpson|ooo , everyone's coming over to congratulate us !
marge simpson|humble faces , kids !
marge simpson|humbler !
marge simpson|lisa , too humble .
marge simpson|you're home early !
marge simpson|moe's is closed , huh ?
marge simpson|we can enjoy each others' company .

marge simpson|i didn't see you come in .

marge simpson|blessing having you around the house , making my life easier , as you so put it , so i thought you deserved a reward .
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|i thought you were at that sports bar .
marge simpson|well , i am glad you're spending more time with us , but maybe you should get a plumber to help you with that .
marge simpson|in the mood for another round ?
marge simpson|at least in hell the heat still works .
marge simpson|what is it ?
marge simpson|golf it is .
marge simpson|have fun , homie .
marge simpson|well you can take another in forty years !
marge simpson|you can't even show it in the bar ?
marge simpson|maybe we're not going home right away .
marge simpson|well , you could get some ice cream , or ^
marge simpson|spend a week at performing arts camp !
marge simpson|whoops didn't time that quite right .
marge simpson|did you really think i'd forget ?
marge simpson|now have a great time !
marge simpson|aw , you think i forgot you ?
marge simpson|babies shouldn't jump to conclusions !
marge simpson|your week's up !
marge simpson|time to go home !
marge simpson|perestroika ?
marge simpson|no time !
marge simpson|i don't wanna get stuck behind the joggers from the fat camp .

marge simpson|we've got plenty of songs in the car , by maggie's favorite singer roofi !
marge simpson|bupupup !
marge simpson|safety locks !
marge simpson|no appetite , honey ?
marge simpson|lisa ?
marge simpson|are you in here ?

marge simpson|dammit .
marge simpson|now remember what grampa said you can spend the money any way you want .
marge simpson|hm , i think i'll look for a new handbag ^
marge simpson|ooo , so many celebrities have their own label princess penelope , booberella , the real housewives of ogdenville , even scratchy .
marge simpson|ooo , i wonder how much that one is .
marge simpson|gotta look without looking like i'm looking .
marge simpson|yes !
marge simpson|i'd like this bag , please !
marge simpson|why wouldn't i ?
marge simpson|hey , my husband makes good money , and we can certainly afford ^
marge simpson|oh , i didn't realize ^

marge simpson|don't worry , homer i'll return the handbag first thing tomorrow .
marge simpson|well at least it's a good place to see celebrities .
marge simpson|you go ahead , i'll stay here .
marge simpson|if i get something on this handbag , i won't be able to return it .
marge simpson|i suppose i should get something to eat .
marge simpson|thank god !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|take me home !
marge simpson|stay cool , marge .
marge simpson|stay cool ^

marge simpson|i will never do that again .
marge simpson|homie , you know what happens when you push your luck ^
marge simpson|well , i learned a valuable lesson about wanting more than i could afford .
marge simpson|sweetie , you could still go to mcgill the harvard of canada .
marge simpson|homie , maybe you could do it .
marge simpson|you know , someday these kids will be out of the house and you'll regret not spending more time with them .
marge simpson|no it's not !
marge simpson|cut it out !
marge simpson|you're upsetting the gravy boat !
marge simpson|lisa , can't you let your brother back on the team ?
marge simpson|fly balls and fungoes come and go , but family is forever .
marge simpson|what about bart's feelings ?
marge simpson|why do you say such ridiculous things ?
marge simpson|mama bear said 'i'm sure sister bear will come to her senses .
marge simpson|brother bear said sister bear is inconsiderate .
marge simpson|actually , i'm taking you on a special little guy super happy fun day !
marge simpson|you're not going to the dentist !
marge simpson|lisa ?
marge simpson|she wants to talk to you .
marge simpson|mike scioscia !
marge simpson|didn't you get radiation poisoning working at the springfield nuclear plant ?
marge simpson|this is that videogame reverend lovejoy said you shouldn't play !
marge simpson|i still think it's too violent .
marge simpson|these classic board games are fun and safe .
marge simpson|colonel ketchup , i say it was you that killed him in the parlor with the letter opener .
marge simpson|oh homie , what a great idea to take a cruise in uncharted waters .
marge simpson|whew , sure is hot out here ^

marge simpson|oh , roger !
marge simpson|you really know what you're doing !
marge simpson|that's crazy talk !
marge simpson|that is so sweet !
marge simpson|why did you do that ?
marge simpson|no it wasn't !
marge simpson|no , it was berrypeach !
marge simpson|please !
marge simpson|homer , i am so sick of this unmotivated , jealous ^
marge simpson|the pie was poisoned .
marge simpson|you were right !
marge simpson|i guess we've got to kill him before he kills us .
marge simpson|what do you mean , this one ?
marge simpson|oh roger , would you hand me the suntan oil ?
marge simpson|now !
marge simpson|dear god .
marge simpson|we just killed a man .

marge simpson|we killed an innocent man .
marge simpson|we're murderers !
marge simpson|murderers !
marge simpson|why did you do that ?
marge simpson|you're alive ?
marge simpson|we'll know .
marge simpson|i can't live with the guilt .
marge simpson|just sugarplums and buttercups .
marge simpson|dinner is served .
marge simpson|i tried to make what homer said you liked .
marge simpson|get them back she can't get neckholes !
marge simpson|it's picture day tomorrow !
marge simpson|yes , but they sold a bunch off to that frozen yogurt chain .
marge simpson|oh homie , maybe we should call it a day .
marge simpson|i know where we are !
marge simpson|this is the neighborhood where i grew up !
marge simpson|ooo , everything's changed !
marge simpson|that tree used to be a smaller tree .
marge simpson|and that food bank used to be a regular bank .
marge simpson|there's my old house !
marge simpson|we're not here for rabbit .
marge simpson|i used to live in this house as a girl .
marge simpson|oh , i'd love to , if it's not an imposition .
marge simpson|everything's just the way i remember it ^
marge simpson|you see that mirror ?
marge simpson|i discovered that if i sat in the kitchen i could see if the bathroom was free using the reflection from the mirror off the toaster .
marge simpson|this was my bedroom !
marge simpson|my bedpost smooshes are still in the carpet !
marge simpson|there are no books in the car .
marge simpson|my memorables !
marge simpson|my whole childhood is in this box !
marge simpson|my scrunchies !
marge simpson|i never really had the hair for these .
marge simpson|oh , that's ancient history .
marge simpson|ooh , here's my paper on ancient history .
marge simpson|you kids play nice up there !
marge simpson|but it's not good enough , is it ?
marge simpson|that's odd .
marge simpson|lisa just threw her saxophone out the window .
marge simpson|she doesn't want to end up like me ?
marge simpson|what's so wrong with me ?
marge simpson|i remember everything .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|just a picture of lisa .
marge simpson|who wants to be nothing like me .
marge simpson|stupid pan .
marge simpson|uhhuh , yeah .

marge simpson|homer , lisa , could you please step outside ?
marge simpson|i have a few choice words for this gentleman .
marge simpson|you what ?
marge simpson|awww .
marge simpson|what's wrong , sweetie you seem upset .
marge simpson|is it milhouse ?
marge simpson|are you sure ?
marge simpson|he's having a growth spurt .
marge simpson|is it a girl ?
marge simpson|hm , i never figured him for the bully type .
marge simpson|well , if he's got you cornered , and milhouse isn't there to help you , there's only one way out make him feel good about himself .
marge simpson|i don't know , compliment his glasses .
marge simpson|there we go .
marge simpson|clean ^
marge simpson|and white ^
marge simpson|and soft .
marge simpson|lisa , honey , i insist .
marge simpson|because it's important to you that you don't turn out like me .

marge simpson|i'm so glad you two are friends again .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|how did you get ^
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|stop burning !
marge simpson|they have a vaccine !
marge simpson|homer , did you know he was in the pile ?

marge simpson|why are you wearing that costume ?
marge simpson|bart , who are you talking to ?
marge simpson|what's all that noise ?
marge simpson|hm ^
marge simpson|well , okay .
marge simpson|i hope they use that spit for a good cause , like sealing wedding envelopes .
marge simpson|thank god mr burns isn't alive to see this .
marge simpson|just because mr burns was mean to you , that doesn't give you the right to abuse him when he's helpless .
marge simpson|it's not up to you .
marge simpson|we're going to take him to our moral and civic leaders .
marge simpson|they'll know the right thing to do .
marge simpson|mr burns , you can't hurt us after all we've done for you .
marge simpson|you were given six weeks to live .
marge simpson|and you've outlived it !
marge simpson|i think what kept you alive was that for once in your life you were helping other people .
marge simpson|homer , are you scaring those kids ?
marge simpson|opossum !
marge simpson|sweetie , everyone has an animal they can't stand .
marge simpson|indiana jones had snakes , the grizzly man had grizzlies , and ^
marge simpson|you know , i'm not crazy about opossums .
marge simpson|those creepy little claws ^
marge simpson|who's a possum ?
marge simpson|you're a possum .
marge simpson|what's that ?
marge simpson|you brickyard bimbo !
marge simpson|we know .
marge simpson|and we're going to do something about it .
marge simpson|how can you say a thing like that ?
marge simpson|no he doesn't !
marge simpson|homie , why don't you study these ?
marge simpson|i bought it because catherine zeta jones told me to .
marge simpson|what a fool i was .
marge simpson|are you sure ?
marge simpson|we're bringing the dog because we've found him a new home at a farm upstate where he can run and play all day .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|for once , a pet going to a farm upstate really is going to a farm upstate .
marge simpson|well , ditching is a harsh word .
marge simpson|it wasn't really a lot of chitchat .
marge simpson|bart , sweetie ^
marge simpson|would you like to say goodbye ?
marge simpson|so , lisa .
marge simpson|do you want an ostrich feather centerpiece ?
marge simpson|well we've gotta buy something !
marge simpson|more oxycontin candy , sweetie ?
marge simpson|wrong holiday , stupid !
marge simpson|i could use some help !
marge simpson|lisa , what are you doing ?
marge simpson|next you'll have a problem with my gingerbread house .
marge simpson|at least someone around here's got the christmas spirit .
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|but you wanted those toys .
marge simpson|even mac davis himself couldn't save this christmas .
marge simpson|i'm trying !
marge simpson|it just keeps popping off .
marge simpson|you can make it through this , marge .
marge simpson|just think of homer .
marge simpson|this tree reminds me of your father .
marge simpson|it's round in the middle , thinning on top , and your hands get sticky when you touch it .
marge simpson|right before christmas ?
marge simpson|but i ^
marge simpson|auf wiedersehen .
marge simpson|i've always believed in you even when others didn't .
marge simpson|can you help save our family christmas ?
marge simpson|marge simpson .
marge simpson|martha stewart !

marge simpson|but i was gonna oooh !
marge simpson|so , this stuff will just shampoo out , huh ?
marge simpson|he's starting to wake up .
marge simpson|martha , the house looks beautiful it's like christmas with a childless gay couple .
marge simpson|but it's just not the same without my family being themselves .
marge simpson|you have a magic wand ?
marge simpson|i guess i'll never have a perfect christmas .
marge simpson|what's wrong , homie ?

marge simpson|i didn't .
marge simpson|i got secondhand wasted from smooching your father .

marge simpson|dear lord , watch over my sweet homie while he's in the hoosegow .
marge simpson|what's going on ?
marge simpson|i called the prison and they won't tell me where homer is !
marge simpson|homie , i know you had a terrible experience , but it's over .
marge simpson|you never took me to that bar on the beach .
marge simpson|sounds pretty good .
marge simpson|why do you have to eat peanuts in the shower ?
marge simpson|i was afraid this day would come .
marge simpson|when it's closed it's a chair !
marge simpson|when you were little , i used to take you to a mommyandme toddler gym .
marge simpson|you were friends with three other boys and i became close with their moms .
marge simpson|but they were a bad influence on you .
marge simpson|the moms and i had a falling out , which was a shame .
marge simpson|we had been such good friends .
marge simpson|we called ourselves the cool moms .
marge simpson|maybe we could get back together ^
marge simpson|you can't buy white wine !

marge simpson|seven years .

marge simpson|talking , chatting ^
marge simpson|i'm glad you had fun , because we're all getting together next week .

marge simpson|i remember why i left this group seven years ago , and it's why i'm leaving now !
marge simpson|good day , ladies .
marge simpson|i think they were never my friends ^
marge simpson|maybe true friends aren't random people you meet at a mommy and me class .
marge simpson|they're random people you meet in a college dorm .
marge simpson|awww ^
marge simpson|well ^
marge simpson|homer got along so well with the other dads , i couldn't break it to him .
marge simpson|you know , this is the first time i've ever been at moe's without that little voice in the back of my head saying this is not a safe place to drink .
marge simpson|what do you mean , wig ?
marge simpson|moe , do these guys think you're one of them ?
marge simpson|now it's ready for garbage !
marge simpson|what's wrong , homie ?
marge simpson|there's nothing sexier than a man being a good dad .
marge simpson|whoa !
marge simpson|just hope the kids didn't hear us .
marge simpson|homer , you can't order anything from that magazine .

marge simpson|hey , they're your gutters too .

marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|we only have five minutes until the school bus comes .
marge simpson|my first gray hair !
marge simpson|homie , you always mean to say the nicest things .

marge simpson|but i never knew you were so good with hair .
marge simpson|well ^

marge simpson|don't do that , homie .
marge simpson|it rubs off your side hair .
marge simpson|i hope you're proud of yourself , homer .
marge simpson|well , there's ned out on his power walk .

marge simpson|a shooting star !
marge simpson|on a night like tonight i have to believe there are .
marge simpson|wanna make out over the foul line ?
marge simpson|don't even bother shooting us .
marge simpson|we've found a new place that we love .
marge simpson|a place that may not have indoor plumbing , but it's got something we treasure more ^
marge simpson|what are you doing here ?
marge simpson|stop !
marge simpson|stop !
marge simpson|this is everything we put behind us !
marge simpson|ooh !
marge simpson|an apron with a sonnet !
marge simpson|a bunny !
marge simpson|just like the one i had when i was a girl !
marge simpson|how did you know ?
marge simpson|oh bart , you got me the fluffy pet i've never stopped thinking about !
marge simpson|now , last but not least , your present , homie .
marge simpson|well , we're still focused on me instead of watching golf , so that's pretty good .
marge simpson|please don't say one again .
marge simpson|homie , whatever it is , it's not happening .
marge simpson|well , at least you remembered i like her .
marge simpson|i think that's enough birthday fun .
marge simpson|homie , have you seen our stencil budget for this month ?
marge simpson|he won't leave the car .
marge simpson|i can see how this show might not be to his liking .
marge simpson|wait , wait , wait .
marge simpson|he's just a boy !
marge simpson|do you have to put him in jail ?
marge simpson|why ?
marge simpson|are you going to do the laundry ?
marge simpson|what's going on ?
marge simpson|we're wetting the bed ?
marge simpson|i'm sorry , homie .
marge simpson|a diaper just isn't sexy .
marge simpson|he's a baby with wings !
marge simpson|that's just not doing it for me .
marge simpson|professor frink , are you all right ?
marge simpson|it's kind of embarrassing ^
marge simpson|how do you know about it ?
marge simpson|so we can go inside homer's sleeping mind and find out why he's wetting the bed .
marge simpson|why does maggie have to go ?
marge simpson|it's death !
marge simpson|i recognize him from fortiethbirthday cards !
marge simpson|homie , this might be a clue !
marge simpson|what's in that coffin could be behind your nighttime oopsies !
marge simpson|what do you see ?
marge simpson|relax , everyone knows that if you die in a dream , you just wake up !
marge simpson|at last we'll get to the bottom of ^
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|we're here to find answers to your problem !
marge simpson|we know there's a marriage in trouble and it has something to do with fish ^
marge simpson|mona , you're alive ?
marge simpson|that's jennifer aniston's hair on friends .
marge simpson|case closed !
marge simpson|now , let's return our dream skis .
marge simpson|uhoh .
marge simpson|and maybe you'll stop overeating too !
marge simpson|spin the top .
marge simpson|if it falls over , we're in reality .
marge simpson|if it spins forever , we're still in a dream .
marge simpson|sounds like a plan !
marge simpson|is that hail coming down ?
marge simpson|your father must be sleeping on his side again .
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|you're home early !
marge simpson|well , we're having brunch with my sisters ^
marge simpson|and you and i were going to study the municipal voter's guide .
marge simpson|homie , what are you drinking ?
marge simpson|there's champagne in those !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|irish and long island !
marge simpson|mike's hard !
marge simpson|rum cake !
marge simpson|suzette !
marge simpson|it's no fun to live in a town with a ninetynine percent unemployment rate .
marge simpson|mr burns seemed like such a nice man the day he arrived .
marge simpson|which he didn't .
marge simpson|barney ?
marge simpson|do a lot of people pay ?
marge simpson|bart , you haven't touched your mashed potatoes .
marge simpson|bart , no dinner means no dessert .
marge simpson|he exercises so much , but he looks the same .
marge simpson|i guess the weight will all come off at once some day in the future .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|you're using your expensive new treadmill just to watch a show that went off the air five years ago ?
marge simpson|and when i wanted to watch it with you then , you said it was pretentious and repetitive !
marge simpson|it means use the treadmill for running or take it back !
marge simpson|on the tv !
marge simpson|on the ground !
marge simpson|this is the stupidest fight ever !
marge simpson|i don't think so .
marge simpson|it means i'm mad !
marge simpson|why , if it isn't jimbo , dorf and ernie .
marge simpson|bart's not home yet , but i'm always looking to encourage nonmilhouse playdates .
marge simpson|stick around !
marge simpson|now you be careful with bart's undies .
marge simpson|homer , for god sakes , i'm trying to put maggie to sleep !
marge simpson|you wanna know what happens on your stupid show ?
marge simpson|firstly , the mysterious island is fifteen miles from long beach .
marge simpson|also , doorway three led to hell despite the series creators' repeated insistence it did not lead to hell , and the entire strandedverse is a piece of gravel in a cosmic kitty litter box !
marge simpson|lisa , are you out there in your slippers ?
marge simpson|come inside !
marge simpson|homie , come in the bedroom .
marge simpson|care to join me in a private last episode party ?
marge simpson|i'm sorry , sweetie .
marge simpson|maybe we could afford a vacation if some big shot didn't pick up the tab for his buddies at mr steak .
marge simpson|well of course they don't .
marge simpson|there is no mrs steak .
marge simpson|who could stay married to such a man .
marge simpson|just try to enjoy your dinner , sweetie .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|we saw how much this cruise means to you , so we all sold something special .
marge simpson|and we made just enough for an economy cabin !
marge simpson|and i sold our good china .
marge simpson|yeah ^
marge simpson|actually , my mom stole it from a woman she cleaned for .
marge simpson|it took her years to get the whole set .
marge simpson|we sold it to pay for a family cruise !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|this is bad for you , too !
marge simpson|no , honey .
marge simpson|you just passed out when you saw the private bedroom in our triple upgrade !
marge simpson|you'll never guess how many bath towels they gave us ^
marge simpson|enough !
marge simpson|homie ^
marge simpson|we actually have the cabin all to ourselves .
marge simpson|woowoowoowoo !
marge simpson|any place is fun if you're there with super lips .
marge simpson|purple !
marge simpson|bart , we're too worried to enjoy each other's mouths .
marge simpson|last week that steward brought me extra shampoo ^
marge simpson|he called me lovely lady .
marge simpson|bart , glad you're here .
marge simpson|we're all gonna watch a movie together .
marge simpson|there is no virus !
marge simpson|bart faked the whole thing with a dvd !
marge simpson|a directtovideo dvd !
marge simpson|excuse me , cruise director priddis .
marge simpson|my son has something to tell you .
marge simpson|i know my son did a terrible thing .
marge simpson|sorry sweetie , i just needed to get that out of my system .
marge simpson|whoa .
marge simpson|stop saying what you call things !
marge simpson|i'm trying to watch the movie !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|people are here to see the movie , not listen to you !
marge simpson|there was enough talking during the movie !
marge simpson|this date night was even worse than the date night we saw date night .
marge simpson|just take me home .
marge simpson|not in the mood .
marge simpson|got what , homer ?
marge simpson|homer , i'm a single mother trying to raise a family here .
marge simpson|just zip it !
marge simpson|i have to take maggie for her checkup .
marge simpson|and a guy's coming to see what the smell is under the house .
marge simpson|homie's been working so hard i thought i'd bring him a special lunch .
marge simpson|here , right ?
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|i knew there was a reason he was leaving on time !
marge simpson|busy day at work ?
marge simpson|did you get a lot of work done , workerman ?
marge simpson|head injury ?
marge simpson|why didn't you tell me ?
marge simpson|this car's so clean !
marge simpson|i'm not getting flea bites on my ankles !
marge simpson|why is he trying to kill you and why did she call you her love ?
marge simpson|the guy from the movie ?
marge simpson|so , how many more weeks do you have off ?
marge simpson|also , the passion play isn't stupid , it's the greatest story ever told !
marge simpson|ned and edna married ?
marge simpson|congratulations , you two !
marge simpson|we're so , so happy for you !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|enough with the voting .
marge simpson|ned , edna , why didn't you tell us ?
marge simpson|ned , edna ^
marge simpson|we just want to apologize for the commotion in your room ^
marge simpson|well , we're here to offer to throw you a little party in your honor .
marge simpson|this is my third favorite wedding supply store !
marge simpson|it's extreme enough for me when they smear the wedding cake on each other's faces .
marge simpson|well , you're all invited , so you can make your snippy comments while you eat my hors d'oeuvres .
marge simpson|thank you !
marge simpson|everyone's having a great time .
marge simpson|helen , have a canapé !
marge simpson|there's enough for everyone , but not too much .
marge simpson|no weird hookups !
marge simpson|so , how do the boys like springfield elementary ?
marge simpson|time for cake !
marge simpson|let's finish this sucker up .
marge simpson|why does that make him right ?
marge simpson|no video ^
marge simpson|party over ^
marge simpson|caaaake !
marge simpson|ned , how did you sleep ?
marge simpson|here's your lunches .
marge simpson|with some cake .
marge simpson|you'll be having cake for a long , long , time .
marge simpson|bart , is there something you want to tell us ?
marge simpson|that is totally irresponsible parenting !
marge simpson|where on the internet ?
marge simpson|why would you believe him ?
marge simpson|ned , i realized long ago , there are some things homer and i will never completely agree on .
marge simpson|it's angry .
marge simpson|it's about not agreeing on something .
marge simpson|bart , just tell us the problem !
marge simpson|and that's how berber carpet got its name , according to some .
marge simpson|lisa , how was your day ?
marge simpson|whoever this truth teller is , i'm a fan .
marge simpson|it takes a lot of courage to post nice things anonymously .
marge simpson|now sweetie , don't make a big deal out of this .
marge simpson|i stopped reading after top student .
marge simpson|i'm afraid handholding isn't going to cheer me up .
marge simpson|i never have any idea what to do for lisa .
marge simpson|to be the mother of someone who's so smart and so sensitive and who beautifully plays an instrument i don't really care for .
marge simpson|it's so hard .
marge simpson|i wish i was one of those young women who could just wave their hands in front of their eyes and not cry , 'cause it doesn't work for me .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|lisa snuck out .
marge simpson|what are you gonna say ?
marge simpson|homer , we can buy scotch tape tomorrow !
marge simpson|all right , who took the microwave ?
marge simpson|bart , that's sweet , but we'd need airplane money , hotel money ^
marge simpson|homer , that sounds like the sweet smell of success .
marge simpson|so , this is basically what we can afford .
marge simpson|oh , forget it .
marge simpson|just once i'd like your father to be on a jumbotron for something good .
marge simpson|no , lisa !
marge simpson|if you click that turnstile , it'll blow our budget !
marge simpson|ladiesandgentlemenihaveanannouncement .
marge simpson|that's not iambic pentameter !
marge simpson|our search for culture is thus concluded / for the bard of avon is wellsuited / to a crowd with ev'ry cell phone muted / jeez , i can't stop talking like this .
marge simpson|well at least it didn't end as bad as romeo and juliet .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|for details , log onto thesimpsons .
marge simpson|com .
marge simpson|okay , that's it !
marge simpson|i'm putting a babygate across the black hole , and don't throw anything more into it !
marge simpson|uhoh , yes , homer .
marge simpson|i know we shouldn't feed this , but grease brings raccoons .
marge simpson|quit bageling my english muffins !
marge simpson|now what ?
marge simpson|wonderful stuff !
marge simpson|enjoy it !
marge simpson|not with the camera on .
marge simpson|looks like the red light's on .
marge simpson|i don't know , i don't know !
marge simpson|i'm sure i don't know !
marge simpson|come here , you .
marge simpson|give back my baby !
marge simpson|i brought this on us all .
marge simpson|it began when i was a girl ^
marge simpson|it was not love at first sight !
marge simpson|here's your smoothie , sweetheart .
marge simpson|i'll tell you what i'm doing , i'm realizing that i married the wrong man .
marge simpson|oh , you poor , sweet , simple homers .
marge simpson|i was supposed to be with all of you .
marge simpson|even you , caveman homer .
marge simpson|well , cardinal or cannibal , i wish that twenty years ago i had chosen love .
marge simpson|lemme get this straight .
marge simpson|none of you had time to take out the garbage ?
marge simpson|hummingbirds !
marge simpson|hum and get it !
marge simpson|homie , the faucet is dripping .
marge simpson|homer , when are you going to fix this faucet ?
marge simpson|are you going to fix the faucet or not ?
marge simpson|i'll get to it , marge ^
marge simpson|i'll get to it ^
marge simpson|when we first got married , he'd only take six months to do things ^
marge simpson|everyone relax .
marge simpson|i think i've got an emergency sinkhole kit in here somewhere .
marge simpson|no one stays in the sinkhole !
marge simpson|but my car is down there !
marge simpson|no , i'm here to buy one myself .
marge simpson|this car looks a little small .
marge simpson|is the engine powerful ?
marge simpson|well , that's odd , because the consumer website says the rx12 2cylinder has a dealer's invoice of fourteen seven .
marge simpson|this says you are the manager .
marge simpson|it says on your facebook page you have no kids .
marge simpson|uhoh !
marge simpson|do you hear that rattle ?
marge simpson|and what's that smell ?
marge simpson|well i don't like it .
marge simpson|i still smell it !
marge simpson|darn car won't start .
marge simpson|hmm .
marge simpson|well , it wouldn't start for me .
marge simpson|i think this car's a lemon !
marge simpson|the wipers wipe backwards , and the defroster lines on the back window are too close together !
marge simpson|excuse me .
marge simpson|what are you talking about ?
marge simpson|all right , i remember we all got in ^
marge simpson|and by the way , that backseat is pretty tight for the kids .
marge simpson|i mean , i don't know what we'd do if we had another baby .
marge simpson|with this car , we're basically saying no more babies !
marge simpson|homer , the reason i hate this car is ^
marge simpson|i think i want another baby !
marge simpson|i do !
marge simpson|homie , i want another baby .
marge simpson|maggie's not a baby !
marge simpson|her soft spot's been skulled over for the last three months !
marge simpson|being a mom is who i am , and i'm not done being who i am .
marge simpson|well , take a shower , 'cause we're gonna try it tonight !
marge simpson|homer , why do you take a three second pause before you answer what i say ?
marge simpson|what a wonderful thought .
marge simpson|my husband and i have been snuggling six ways from sunday ^
marge simpson|but we aren't making a baby .
marge simpson|i thought we should check , to make sure homer has ^
marge simpson|you know , working stuntmen in his cannon .
marge simpson|what do you mean ?
marge simpson|i guess ^
marge simpson|that's that , then .
marge simpson|i can't believe we're never going to have another child ^
marge simpson|no , s'okay .
marge simpson|we can share this with you ^
marge simpson|homer can't make a baby because he nuked his swimmers .
marge simpson|you never told me about that .
marge simpson|awww ^
marge simpson|eww ^
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|we still have a chance !
marge simpson|now i'm thinking alex if it's a girl and xander if it's a boy .
marge simpson|okay .
marge simpson|ooh , a christmas ornament museum !
marge simpson|can we stop ?
marge simpson|i think that shiva used to be paul bunyan .
marge simpson|i can't believe we spent the whole day here .
marge simpson|well , maybe we should check into a motel .
marge simpson|ooh , homie , you've lost weight .
marge simpson|it sure was nice to have a day together as a couple .
marge simpson|i thought the whole point of this trip was to have another baby .
marge simpson|so , you don't want another baby ?
marge simpson|how long have you felt this way ?
marge simpson|just yell across the house like you do everything else !
marge simpson|we're not talking !
marge simpson|you were pocketdialed !
marge simpson|shush !
marge simpson|homer ^
marge simpson|homer , this is the point where i really have to know what you want .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|how many samples did you sell ?
marge simpson|i thought they only paid fifty dollars a trip .
marge simpson|homie , maybe we should wait .
marge simpson|maybe there's enough homer in the world for now .
marge simpson|you know , i always send the theater manager a check the next day .
marge simpson|another way is don't drink .
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|do you know what yesterday was ?
marge simpson|yesterday's the day we were supposed to visit grampa !
marge simpson|i still feel guilty .
marge simpson|your father's not going to be around forever .
marge simpson|fine , he'll be around forever .
marge simpson|there's gotta be a clue in here somewhere .
marge simpson|spats , sock garters , the world's hardest hard candy ^
marge simpson|grampa's army footlocker !
marge simpson|i bet the most important things in the world to him are in this box !
marge simpson|spiro's ^
marge simpson|the place that changed my life ?
marge simpson|got it .
marge simpson|papadapaconstantikasgianopolopodopotopolis .
marge simpson|there's exactly one rita lafleur living in springfield !
marge simpson|hello ?
marge simpson|rita lafleur ?
marge simpson|did you know a man named abe simpson ?
marge simpson|homer , she's married to your dad !
marge simpson|you never looked up to him .
marge simpson|well , we certainly don't want to cause you any more pain .
marge simpson|that kind of romance leads to children .
marge simpson|so , this was after homer's mother left ?
marge simpson|but i thought you still loved him .
marge simpson|what does that mean ?
marge simpson|abe , we were so worried .
marge simpson|grampa , we will never miss a visit again .
marge simpson|and there'll be a lot more of them .
marge simpson|don't take grampa's meds !
marge simpson|sh !
marge simpson|here comes lisa's solo !
marge simpson|lisa !
marge simpson|please say it's the vegetarianism !
marge simpson|lisa , dinnertime !
marge simpson|lisa ^
marge simpson|would you like some shrimp ?
marge simpson|homer , pay attention !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|the roof is leaking !
marge simpson|water's coming in the house , and we've got carpet mushrooms !
marge simpson|while you were out there daydreaming , this rain has ruined the house .
marge simpson|you're coming with us to the school fundraiser .
marge simpson|the only thing we know is it'll cost eight hundred dollars .
marge simpson|i don't care for silent auctions .
marge simpson|it just encourages hovering .
marge simpson|that adult etchasketch certainly has brightened your mood .
marge simpson|i always thought the pringles man had the kindest eyes .
marge simpson|are you doing an app behind my back ?
marge simpson|put that down !
marge simpson|we're being audited !
marge simpson|homie , you want to read to maggie before she goes to sleep ?
marge simpson|homie ^
marge simpson|it looks like you're putting all your eggs in one basket .
marge simpson|hm , i guess you're right .
marge simpson|i guess i'll have to scratch that off the list of things i say .
marge simpson|well ^
marge simpson|i like that its message is in sap and not in blood ^
marge simpson|like some miracles i could mention .
marge simpson|passover .
marge simpson|homie ?
marge simpson|aren't you going to come in ?
marge simpson|don't call satan !
marge simpson|so what if the message wasn't a miracle ?
marge simpson|the answer isn't in syrup from god or a computer tablet , the answer is that the hope you felt was real .
marge simpson|homie , you have such a way with foods .
marge simpson|let's go inside .
marge simpson|no idea .
marge simpson|the important thing is that they did .
marge simpson|relax , kids , just be yourselves .
marge simpson|scientists prove cat heaven real , human heaven not that's so sad ^
marge simpson|oh ^
marge simpson|satire .
marge simpson|and these fake movie reviews are so mean , it's hilarious .
marge simpson|great paper .
marge simpson|maggie's a little hungry .
marge simpson|that's not applesauce ^
marge simpson|it sure is !
marge simpson|there's nothing more natural than ^
marge simpson|that .
marge simpson|it's just that maggie's already ^
marge simpson|milked me today !
marge simpson|homer , i think we should go .
marge simpson|we're not like these people .
marge simpson|you're all bald !
marge simpson|maybe we shouldn't rush things with the new neighbors .
marge simpson|you know , we might not all be a perfect match .
marge simpson|but i always thought you were cool .
marge simpson|well sweetie , if it's that important to you , i guess we can try .
marge simpson|ooo !
marge simpson|hygiene !
marge simpson|your father took you to a korean gangster film festival ?
marge simpson|the kids are a mess !
marge simpson|you brought them home exhausted and pretentious !
marge simpson|parenting shouldn't have a style !
marge simpson|parenting is about bedtimes and passwords on computers and complicated punishments you never follow through on !
marge simpson|are you wearing a wallet chain ?
marge simpson|you look like ^
marge simpson|a barista !
marge simpson|and what's with the scarf ?
marge simpson|it's soaked in neck sweat .
marge simpson|made ?
marge simpson|why didn't you just buy him a toy ?
marge simpson|geez , is this a kid's birthday party or the place a bad guy kidnaps you to in a movie ?
marge simpson|there's gotta be a bounce house around here somewhere .
marge simpson|at least maybe a piñata ^
marge simpson|holy areole ^
marge simpson|i'd love to , but maggie's a little shy ^
marge simpson|play along !
marge simpson|ooh , this couldn't feel more natural .
marge simpson|glug , glug , glug .
marge simpson|that's a good little mammal .
marge simpson|fine !
marge simpson|i admit it , you ^
marge simpson|nipple nazis !
marge simpson|i give my baby formula !
marge simpson|stay back !
marge simpson|you know i'll use this ^
marge simpson|because you saw me using it .
marge simpson|also , i didn't want to tell you , but ^
marge simpson|that wife and her gang looked down on me because i don't breastfeed !
marge simpson|when you're old , your tattoos will be saggy and illegible !
marge simpson|see , see what i'm dealing with here , ned ?
marge simpson|we invited them here , and they repay us with insults and judgments .
marge simpson|the cool people are everywhere !
marge simpson|somehow they've even made the weather rainier !
marge simpson|c'mere , little buddy .
marge simpson|stop your trendy arguing !
marge simpson|i'm trying to call the fire department !
marge simpson|then to save us ^
marge simpson|we need something incredibly unnatural !
marge simpson|fifty gallons of baby formula will put out that blaze .
marge simpson|i guess i do feel a little bad about not breastfeeding my kids ^
marge simpson|except lisa .
marge simpson|i breastfed lisa for nine months .
marge simpson|milhouse ?
marge simpson|hurry up !
marge simpson|i want to get grampa back here by three so we can get him and maggie on the same nap schedule .
marge simpson|you know you can't lift your lifting belt without wearing your beltliftingbelt !
marge simpson|fine .
marge simpson|just stay here and hold down the fort .
marge simpson|maybe one of your tavern wenches can do the laundry .
marge simpson|did you spend this whole time doing fake chores in a fake village ?
marge simpson|the animal shelter hasn't had any greyhounds turned in .
marge simpson|just a dachshund , a chow , and a pregnant raccoon .
marge simpson|we don't want a raccoon .
marge simpson|and he didn't pee on the floor !
marge simpson|focus !
marge simpson|well , tell us your version .
marge simpson|oh homie .
marge simpson|i'm so sorry .
marge simpson|just hug already !
marge simpson|homie ?
marge simpson|homer , i told you , don't call me mom .
marge simpson|this isn't the learn zone .
marge simpson|darn it , it's a fun place !
marge simpson|where do they go ?
marge simpson|keep an eye on the kids , homer .
marge simpson|bart and lisa .
marge simpson|calm down , everyone .
marge simpson|calm down .
marge simpson|i'm sure they'll have us out of here soon .
marge simpson|until then , why don't we bond by sharing our child birth experiences .
marge simpson|see ?
marge simpson|all you need to get through a crisis is a little friendly conversation .
marge simpson|betcha the dads are doing the same thing !
marge simpson|you've been through a traumatic experience .
marge simpson|are you sure you wanna go to work today ?
marge simpson|i can't find all our cereal , crackers , juice boxes , the butter brush ^
marge simpson|what move ?
marge simpson|we haven't moved !
marge simpson|what's going on ?
marge simpson|you can't have secrets from your wife !
marge simpson|i thought the basement looked cleaner .
marge simpson|survive what ?
marge simpson|it's reassuring to see you're aware of the future .
marge simpson|but this is all a little ^
marge simpson|creepy .
marge simpson|i'm going to bed .
marge simpson|the end of the world as we know it ?
marge simpson|lisa and maggie are downstairs , and bart's in his room with milhouse .
marge simpson|homie , i never thought we'd turn our backs on our loved ones at the first hint of trouble .
marge simpson|no one was laughing .
marge simpson|you kept it a secret !
marge simpson|how can you call yourself a christian ?
marge simpson|homer simpson !
marge simpson|when i fell in love with you , it was because of your big heart and your good looks .
marge simpson|but some day those good looks are gonna fade .
marge simpson|i'm proud of you .
marge simpson|society may have crumbled , but our decency hasn't .
marge simpson|good boy .
marge simpson|you're a good man , homer simpson .
marge simpson|everything's normal .
marge simpson|the world didn't end .
marge simpson|are you really so disappointed the world didn't end , just so you could be proven right ?
marge simpson|i'm afraid not .
marge simpson|and this goes too .
marge simpson|excuse me , you're that proctor that's shutting down my children's school .
marge simpson|you've been in public education a long time , haven't you ?
marge simpson|burly paper towels , burlyville , minnesota .
marge simpson|dear sir or madam your paper towel packets promised a hundred and two sheets of towels .
marge simpson|but i was blessed to receive one hundred and three .
marge simpson|i'm returning the extra towel , unused ^
marge simpson|a pillowcase full of quarters ?
marge simpson|where did you get that money and what have you done with the pillows ?
marge simpson|well , we're gonna turn this change into change for the better !
marge simpson|and i hope bart passes his test and saves the school .
marge simpson|i'm not sure if you gave my son any ^
marge simpson|extra help .
marge simpson|but if you did , thank you .
marge simpson|would you ^
marge simpson|like to have coffee , or dinner , or just talk ?
marge simpson|in this exciting strategy game , you amass resources timber , salt fish , and wax to fund a syndicate to gain influence with the doges of venice .
marge simpson|we have to do something until the storm passes .
marge simpson|now just fill out these customs forms and we can get started .
marge simpson|no , homie !
marge simpson|it's too dangerous !
marge simpson|what , 'cause they rented a van and taped an antenna to the top ?
marge simpson|all right , but i'm coming with you to make sure no one does anything stupid .
marge simpson|i guess you do know your weather .
marge simpson|aw .
marge simpson|homer , you do not have to compete with your friends for me .
marge simpson|enough with the singing !
marge simpson|it's like god's vacuum cleaner !
marge simpson|and here comes santa's little helper !
marge simpson|homie , we made it !
marge simpson|are you pushing ?
marge simpson|i don't know if we're gonna be able to get out .
marge simpson|what are you writing ?
marge simpson|hey !
marge simpson|hello !
marge simpson|just cut the glass !
marge simpson|except for the face full of glass when the door finally collapsed , he did a pretty good job .
marge simpson|homie , if we did both die , we've never named guardians .
marge simpson|the kids could end up wards of the state .
marge simpson|no , our state .
marge simpson|there's really only one choice .
marge simpson|or should i say two identical choices ?
marge simpson|homer , my sisters adopted ling and she's doing great .
marge simpson|maybe we'd better go .
marge simpson|i think it's time to go off family .
marge simpson|uh oh .
marge simpson|i wonder if word has gotten out that we're looking for guardians .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|dual incomes , no kids at two o'clock !
marge simpson|i think i hear a slight accent .
marge simpson|that's where they filmed the wire !
marge simpson|step on it !
marge simpson|maybe we should just give up for now , have some fried clams and collect sea glass .
marge simpson|that's moe and a bag of garbage .
marge simpson|so , surfing is really your job ?
marge simpson|just for standing on a thing ?
marge simpson|homie ^
marge simpson|it's been a wonderful day ^
marge simpson|but do you think maybe we're moving a little too quickly ?
marge simpson|but we know so little about them .
marge simpson|well , i must admit it's a relief to get that taken care of .
marge simpson|a whole weekend ?
marge simpson|i don't know ^
marge simpson|i guess .
marge simpson|as long as we don't make it a habit .
marge simpson|do you have to do that in front of people ?
marge simpson|well , at least we have time to get the pets' christmas presents .
marge simpson|oh god !
marge simpson|they want to steal our kids !
marge simpson|it all makes sense now .
marge simpson|that's why they took our kids so quick .
marge simpson|she's gonna raise three kids without wrecking that perfect figure .
marge simpson|homie , i just had a horrible thought .
marge simpson|what if they are better for the kids than us ?
marge simpson|look , before anyone says anything else , how could you possibly think you could get our kids ?
marge simpson|kids , your father and i have decided we're not in such a hurry to get you guardians .
marge simpson|homer , listen to the g .
marge simpson|p .
marge simpson|s .
marge simpson|turn right onto first street , head east .

marge simpson|/ our sunday drive is ruined !
marge simpson|hands at ten and two !
marge simpson|homer simpson !
marge simpson|did you take maggie to moe's ?
marge simpson|i was the only one without a date at patty's new lady friend's travel bookstore soft opening !
marge simpson|you should know that me saying i don't care means i couldn't care more .
marge simpson|bart , would you go to your room while your father and i finish our little talk ?
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|fine .
marge simpson|if you boys want it , i'll tell you what i really think .
marge simpson|you're both in the doghouse , which is misleading 'cause i still like the dog .
marge simpson|mmm !
marge simpson|cursive !
marge simpson|you are invited to ^
marge simpson|a grand gesture ?
marge simpson|oooh !
marge simpson|a completed chore list !
marge simpson|don't watch that dvd !
marge simpson|i threw that away because studies show it doesn't do any good !
marge simpson|look at me !
marge simpson|maybe instead of watching tv with the kids , you could take them outside and ^
marge simpson|what are you doing ?
marge simpson|this socalled educational dvd may have even stunted the development of the kids who watched it !
marge simpson|i'm afraid so .
marge simpson|while bart turned out so wonderful in his own way !
marge simpson|i wish i knew what happened ^
marge simpson|and now that i know better , no dvds for you kids .
marge simpson|just educational television .
marge simpson|okay , no tv at all .
marge simpson|fine , no tv for twentyfour hours .
marge simpson|we can do without tv for a day !
marge simpson|we're taking maggie to a children's bookstore , where she can learn the oldfashioned way the way children did from nineteenten to two thousand and two .
marge simpson|homer , a little help ?
marge simpson|instead of watching tv , we can read children's books written by tv stars !
marge simpson|look , maggie !
marge simpson|they have a story lady !
marge simpson|have you seen lisa and maggie ?
marge simpson|homie , help me find them .
marge simpson|mmhmm !
marge simpson|i don't think so .
marge simpson|the u .

marge simpson|embassy has warned people not to go to downtown springfield .
marge simpson|maybe we should go .
marge simpson|now what are you doing ?
marge simpson|homer , that's for children !
marge simpson|read the rest of the title !
marge simpson|oh , dang it !
marge simpson|i lost my other earring .
marge simpson|wondered where that was .
marge simpson|can you find anything you like in this bed ?
marge simpson|homer , bart said the kids were going to the van houtens , but luann just told me they're supposed to be here .
marge simpson|they've disappeared !
marge simpson|do you think lisa went to that jazz club i wouldn't take her to ?
marge simpson|homie , do you see anything ?
marge simpson|the kids ?
marge simpson|the top of your head has a five o'clock shadow .
marge simpson|he's ten years old !
marge simpson|i want to know what it's for .
marge simpson|we spent a thousand dollars on a bunch of old boxes ?
marge simpson|i wasn't laughing i was being worried .
marge simpson|makeup and baby oil !
marge simpson|it's not all lady stuff .
marge simpson|look at all these fitness publications .
marge simpson|i think your dad might be gay .
marge simpson|i think this is great !
marge simpson|old gay men are adorable !
marge simpson|like wrinkle dogs in a wrinkle dog calendar .
marge simpson|your dad's been in the closet for so long , he probably doesn't know how tolerant society's become .
marge simpson|they even had a gay float in the pride parade last year .
marge simpson|oh homie , you're so ^
marge simpson|enlightened .
marge simpson|oh honey , that's just silly !
marge simpson|this'll show helen lovejoy , always bragging about her heshe cousin !
marge simpson|abe ^
marge simpson|we found your storage locker .
marge simpson|if you don't want to die alone , come out of your room !
marge simpson|your father wasted his whole life being married to your mother and having you .
marge simpson|we've got to find him a boyfriend before it's too late !
marge simpson|help me out of the closet !
marge simpson|wonderful older man seeks life partner before rapidlyencroaching death .
marge simpson|how about some fatties ?
marge simpson|okay , post this under men seeking men , but what subheading ^
marge simpson|nothing too serious ^
marge simpson|here we go casual encounters !
marge simpson|perfect , no pressure !
marge simpson|i hope someone saw our ad .
marge simpson|someone's coming !
marge simpson|don't you want to be happy , abe ?
marge simpson|admit who you are , a wonderful gay man !
marge simpson|is this true ?
marge simpson|i so wanted him to be gay .
marge simpson|thank you .
marge simpson|homer , do something !
marge simpson|they're killing each other !
marge simpson|your grandfather is not psycho !
marge simpson|the only thing he's straightup is loves you .
marge simpson|it's so sad that grampa has to cheat instead of relying on his godgiven wrestling skills .
marge simpson|what kind of person revels in disapproval ?
marge simpson|your behavior at that game was unacceptable !
marge simpson|you're lucky they gave you your participant trophy .
marge simpson|i know your grampa seems exciting now ^
marge simpson|but all that preening and cheating , those turnbuckle antics are not gonna make him happy .
marge simpson|i don't care if bart is a wrestler , a busboy , or even a stoplight squeegee man ^
marge simpson|as long as he's a nice person .
marge simpson|but if he gets too much attention for acting bad , he might turn bad on the inside ^
marge simpson|oh , that was so sweet .
marge simpson|i thought you might be cold , honey , so i put this chinchilla coat on you .
marge simpson|it's not chinchilla .
marge simpson|i just thought she needed more sleep .
marge simpson|ned flanders , i can't believe you struck my husband .
marge simpson|ned , homie's a little cranky right now .
marge simpson|more than his eye , i think you hurt his feelings .
marge simpson|my what ?
marge simpson|i never made that noise in my life !
marge simpson|i wish you wouldn't wear sweaters that the senior ladies knit .
marge simpson|what's the matter , sweetie ?
marge simpson|is a book character having difficulties ?
marge simpson|did you tell the teacher ?
marge simpson|a teacher can't be a bully .
marge simpson|we're here because our daughter is being bullied by your teacher .
marge simpson|well , she's just a substitute .
marge simpson|maybe you could transfer ms .
marge simpson|cantwell to another school .
marge simpson|homer , that's you .
marge simpson|power .
marge simpson|power .
marge simpson|they sure are getting along .
marge simpson|objection !
marge simpson|unhealthy !
marge simpson|i volunteered to wash the egg stains off everyone's clothes .
marge simpson|it's one of those things you say and hope nobody takes you up on it .
marge simpson|what's odd ?
marge simpson|splatter ?
marge simpson|interesting .
marge simpson|except you missed one thing .
marge simpson|it's not a skirt .
marge simpson|it's a kilt !
marge simpson|why'd you do it , willie ?
marge simpson|this is the coolest sushi restaurant in town !
marge simpson|it got threeandahalf stars in the springfield tire guide !
marge simpson|if they can be that rude , the food must be great !
marge simpson|it's as yummy as your poorlyproduced local commercial said .
marge simpson|so without the kids we can have sophisticated grownup talk .
marge simpson|uh , i'm thinking of getting maggie swimming lessons .
marge simpson|when god rested on the seventh day , did he take a nap or do a hobby he enjoyed ?
marge simpson|i think i'm interesting !
marge simpson|can you chew with your mouth closed ?
marge simpson|it's like looking into a garbage disposal .
marge simpson|the most romantic part of this was the hold music when i made the reservation .
marge simpson|that usually works , but not today .
marge simpson|lousy .
marge simpson|i'm going to take a cab .
marge simpson|i'm not going to sleep !
marge simpson|inground ?

marge simpson|homie , what are you doing ?
marge simpson|homer ^
marge simpson|this list is from six years ago .
marge simpson|how many times do i have to tell you to quit comparing our relationship to the special olympics ?
marge simpson|he's taken a step .
marge simpson|he's really close .
marge simpson|all he has to do is not eat a piece before i do .
marge simpson|okay .
marge simpson|but every man deserves a second chance .
marge simpson|as long as he doesn't ^
marge simpson|i'm not hungry .
marge simpson|goodnight .

marge simpson|i'm glad you're okay .
marge simpson|homer , i'm glad that you tried , even though now i can't find the washing machine .
marge simpson|ohhh .
marge simpson|not because of what you bought , but because i realized that no matter what , you will never stop trying .
marge simpson|and there's nothing a woman loves more than that .
marge simpson|actually i'm cool with one of them .
marge simpson|not gonna say .
marge simpson|d .
marge simpson|sixteen .
marge simpson|it sure has taken a beating over the years .
marge simpson|might be time to get a new one ^
marge simpson|are there any two words more exciting than couch shopping ?
marge simpson|but they let me take fabric samples !
marge simpson|they had to !
marge simpson|it came from corporate !
marge simpson|how did we get bedbugs ?
marge simpson|i know this seems bad , but nothing brings out the best in springfield like a crisis ^
marge simpson|everyone , please !
marge simpson|calm down !
marge simpson|reverend lovejoy is here !
marge simpson|so charming .
marge simpson|it's like he's selling silver polish at the state fair .

marge simpson|let me give you some castor oil .
marge simpson|i signed you up for the tenandbelow talent show next week !
marge simpson|bart , when you were on that stage , it felt like you were pouring those notes right into my heart .
marge simpson|a proud mother always does .
marge simpson|i'd like to go home now .

marge simpson|i know it .
marge simpson|wrong .
marge simpson|you have to walk all the way over to grampa to take a plate of cookies i baked .
marge simpson|is it your impression of mr burns eating soup ?

marge simpson|you don't know where carl is from ?
marge simpson|maybe if you'd talked less about guy stuff you'd know more about your socalled friend .
marge simpson|you're going so far away .
marge simpson|i'll miss you .
marge simpson|we're not broken !
marge simpson|how am i going to sleep if someone isn't pushing me all the way to the very edge of the bed ?

marge simpson|i didn't mind that he grew bald ^
marge simpson|i didn't mind that he got fat ^

marge simpson|i hate to think of the things this mirror has reflected .
marge simpson|we should have it appraised !
marge simpson|oh my god !
marge simpson|wow , the van houtens owned this for years and never knew how much it was worth .
marge simpson|think how happy they'll be when we sell it and split the money with them .
marge simpson|kirk and luann didn't know what the painting was worth when they sold it .
marge simpson|but the van houtens are our friends !
marge simpson|all our friends are like that !
marge simpson|well how would you feel if we sold them something that turned out to be valuable ?
marge simpson|how about this ^
marge simpson|what if we give the van houtens twentyfive percent of the money ?
marge simpson|sure .
marge simpson|okay ^
marge simpson|i see your point .
marge simpson|we should sell the painting , keep all the money , and never , ever tell the van houtens .
marge simpson|oh sweetie , you want your parents to be happy , don't you ?
marge simpson|if you knew you sold a valuable painting for nothing , how could you live with yourselves ?
marge simpson|we were just trying to be ^
marge simpson|kind .

marge simpson|we don't even get this many christmas cards .
marge simpson|you really think we're still doing the right thing ?
marge simpson|see what your greed has done ?
marge simpson|oh , homer simpson , that painting has torn the town apart , destroyed kirk and luann's marriage , and everyone's very worried about milhouse .
marge simpson|that picture has brought out the worst in everyone !
marge simpson|please ^
marge simpson|just let it go !

marge simpson|actually , i'm a little surprised lisa likes him .
marge simpson|you can do better !
marge simpson|oh , there's my magazine .
marge simpson|why , look at this !
marge simpson|what every father should do for his daughter .
marge simpson|right , right , right , right .
marge simpson|according to judy kleinsmith , a professional freelance writer , fathers should take their daughters out on little dinner dates and treat them like a gentleman would .
marge simpson|then she'll expect the same from the men in her future !
marge simpson|it's not a punishment .
marge simpson|but you can't just eat dinner .
marge simpson|you have to be gentlemanly and attentive .
marge simpson|not fake attentive .
marge simpson|real attentive .
marge simpson|you know lisa's a vegetarian .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|homer , you can't just do the things you want to do .

marge simpson|it goes like this ^
marge simpson|homer , could you come with me for a minute ?
marge simpson|we need to have a conversation in loud whispers .
marge simpson|homie , i felt terrible when you said i felt stuck with you .
marge simpson|but then , i realized i am stuck with you .
marge simpson|i couldn't stop loving you if i tried .
marge simpson|i know , homie .
marge simpson|i know you well enough to know you're not ready to forgive me yet .
marge simpson|but i also know you well enough to know that this will work .
marge simpson|remember that sewing machine you say i never use ?
marge simpson|well , i sold it and bought this dress !
marge simpson|shshsh !

marge simpson|nothing for thirty years .
marge simpson|you're perfect for each other .
marge simpson|well , i don't miss his nonsense .
marge simpson|there's a lot of stuff he blamed on raccoons that i'm starting to suspect was him .
marge simpson|it's only natural to miss a man you buried a hundred and twentyseven times .
marge simpson|phoo !
marge simpson|you two don't know what a rough marriage is .
marge simpson|look , life's tough .
marge simpson|it's hard to make it through .
marge simpson|the only way i know is when you make a decision that comes from your heart , you stick with it .
marge simpson|no , i'm going to join him forever .
marge simpson|after thirtyfive years of marriage , we've finally gotten it right .
marge simpson|maggie !

marge simpson|i want new friends !
marge simpson|okay with no friends .
marge simpson|that's the saddest thing i can imagine my daughter saying to me .
marge simpson|we're going to that game party and we're going to be charming and witty .
marge simpson|you're not going to eat too much , and we're not going to stay too late .
marge simpson|you will not sing unless there's a singalong , and never take the tray out of the caterer's hand .
marge simpson|don't be too loud and don't be too quiet .
marge simpson|when you're too quiet , you get that psycho look .
marge simpson|and stay in the living room .
marge simpson|don't go to their kids' room and watch a basketball game .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|one drink .
marge simpson|you were charming enough to win me , and that day you didn't have a drink in you .
marge simpson|homer !

marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|mm , hm .
marge simpson|that's good .
marge simpson|it's okay .
marge simpson|i mean , those people didn't even want us at that party in the first place .

marge simpson|nothing .
marge simpson|i give up .
marge simpson|no more dinner parties .
marge simpson|our whole social life will be us watching tv and you going to moe's .

marge simpson|we're going to help her make friends .
marge simpson|those are pastdue bills .

marge simpson|lisa .
marge simpson|lisa , wait ^
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i think i went too far .
marge simpson|hm .

marge simpson|the fire department has to raise money by delivering pizza .
marge simpson|lisa !
marge simpson|bath time !
marge simpson|the water's gonna get cold !
marge simpson|maybe we should just light sparklers in the back yard .
marge simpson|sometimes the language on these gets a little blue .
marge simpson|how permissive ?
marge simpson|no , no , it's a big thing .
marge simpson|homer , get up !
marge simpson|krusty , i brought some homemade chicken soup .
marge simpson|we used the playdoh maker for the matzo .

marge simpson|well , anyway bart , you'll cheer up on our camping trip this weekend .
marge simpson|the one you booked for us at owl haven .

marge simpson|i never knew so many women suffered from extramarital jamming .

marge simpson|are you okay ?

marge simpson|your licks are really ^
marge simpson|juicy .
marge simpson|you didn't join a band to become famous like in almost famous .

marge simpson|lisa , sweetie , i'm tired of being a pushover .

marge simpson|thank you , moe .
marge simpson|i've gotta call homer .
marge simpson|no answer .
marge simpson|let's go find your father .
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|i never give up hope .
marge simpson|abe simpson , please .
marge simpson|well , with all that you folks have experienced , i think we could enjoy listening to a little of your wisdom .
marge simpson|no casual racism !
marge simpson|well , he's not in the neon sign store .
marge simpson|i'm sorry .
marge simpson|i'm trying to find my husband and nothing's open .
marge simpson|where is this party ?
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homie , i'm your present tonight .
marge simpson|and the present is that i'm not gonna always assume that you screwed up .
marge simpson|because i realize maybe there's a good explanation for what you do .
marge simpson|or a crazy one that's pretty entertaining .
marge simpson|i thought i had one of those chirping keys .
marge simpson|you didn't have to do that .
marge simpson|i love you just the same .
marge simpson|okay , remember we're parked in the ethnic princess section .
marge simpson|c'mon , maggie .

marge simpson|aww .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|you have to stop dropping your pants for everyone who claims they're a doctor !
marge simpson|there's only one fair solution we have to put it to a vote .
marge simpson|you're the last vote , homie .
marge simpson|doesn't your culture say anything about mercy ?
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|thank god it's just like her busy box .
marge simpson|we're receiving a transmission from an unknown source !
marge simpson|how was your day ?
marge simpson|oh , sweetie ^
marge simpson|there's a yiddish word for it shpilkes .
marge simpson|you've been working so hard lately .
marge simpson|maybe you should take a break .
marge simpson|none .
marge simpson|homie ^
marge simpson|workaholic is probably your best aholic ever , but you need to relax ^
marge simpson|so i got us all tickets to see the circus on saturday .
marge simpson|i thought you were going to try to relax .
marge simpson|homer , i have to use the porta potty .
marge simpson|no woman uses one of these by choice .
marge simpson|what did you give him ?
marge simpson|my husband can't really think he's ten .
marge simpson|so what do we do ?
marge simpson|well , i guess it'll have to be in bart's room .
marge simpson|and i thought when homer cut off his thumb was bad .
marge simpson|i really do miss my homie this time of night .
marge simpson|we're gonna have a lot of mittens this winter .
marge simpson|homer ^
marge simpson|you're not going to school .

marge simpson|they've run away !
marge simpson|homer , come here .
marge simpson|before you fix him ^
marge simpson|can you change one little thing ?
marge simpson|i'm embarrassed to ask this , but after we ^
marge simpson|snuggle , he always rolls over and goes to sleep and i'd rather ^
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|well , here's what happened ^
marge simpson|homie , i've missed you !
marge simpson|oh , so good to have you back .
marge simpson|thank you , svengolly .
marge simpson|i knitted us a blanket .
marge simpson|maybe he's giving those little baby birds some food .
marge simpson|homer , quick !
marge simpson|get your shooing broom !
marge simpson|we love you !
marge simpson|so what brings you to springfield , mr musk ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|car , wake grampa .
marge simpson|what's wrong homer ?
marge simpson|is it that all your friends are out of work and it's kind of your fault ?
marge simpson|here's what you do .
marge simpson|you just take his hand , look in his eyes and say i don't want to be with you anymore .
marge simpson|it's gotten me out of a lot of gym memberships .
marge simpson|goodbye , elon .
marge simpson|our town will never forgive you !
marge simpson|oh lord .
marge simpson|oh , thank you , homie !
marge simpson|homer , it's a standing ovation , get up !
marge simpson|our kids just did something amazing !
marge simpson|get up !
marge simpson|i'm sorry but i can't .
marge simpson|i'm tired of you saying planes have gotten smaller , and two presidents were fatter than you , and ^
marge simpson|that's not a healthy way to lose weight .
marge simpson|you don't have to do this alone .
marge simpson|well that's great , homie .
marge simpson|just let me finish uploading this photo .
marge simpson|thank you , lord .
marge simpson|and i'll give up online scrapbooking like i promised .
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|restore !
marge simpson|restore !
marge simpson|that's worse than what i thought !
marge simpson|thank you .
marge simpson|although , i think the worst thing that ever happened to my husband was joining your group .
marge simpson|homer , you have to choose .
marge simpson|and i think the choice is clear .
marge simpson|who's he giving a piggyback ride to ?
marge simpson|he chose to spend the night in a jail with strangers instead of with me .
marge simpson|homer , i want to say something extremely important the way a woman does subtly through someone else .
marge simpson|kids ?
marge simpson|oh , kids , stop arguing .
marge simpson|or keep arguing .
marge simpson|i don't care .
marge simpson|homer , i'm sorry i tried to help you control your weight .
marge simpson|i'm not sure of anything anymore .
marge simpson|sorry i ever open my mouth .
marge simpson|how can you follow a leader who won't even get up out of his chair ?
marge simpson|it's not that professor x wouldn't get up , it's that he couldn't .
marge simpson|absolutely .
marge simpson|it's because everything you love , you love so much .
marge simpson|i've printed out our driving plan !
marge simpson|if we work together , we can get bart to his sports ^
marge simpson|lisa to her music ^
marge simpson|and maggie to the five birthday parties she's invited to today .
marge simpson|homie !

marge simpson|ooh , i didn't know we could decorate our cars .
marge simpson|so you're a taxi ?

marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|at last !
marge simpson|i'll earn money for schlepping !
marge simpson|you're welcome .

marge simpson|fine .
marge simpson|there's meatloaf ^
marge simpson|why are you telling me all these things ?
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|homer simpson .
marge simpson|working with those plants is great !
marge simpson|it's helped you get in touch with your feminine side .
marge simpson|i didn't mean to use that word !
marge simpson|it's okay to have a feminine side .
marge simpson|it's good in fact !
marge simpson|whatever you want .
marge simpson|moe , i think we'd both be a lot happier if we quit our new jobs .
marge simpson|he's not my lover !
marge simpson|yup .
marge simpson|and i know a place that could use this smile .
marge simpson|lenny said you were babysitting .
marge simpson|and if you are babysitting , why can't you do some at home ?
marge simpson|i could use a night out .
marge simpson|really ?
marge simpson|awag ?
marge simpson|really ?
marge simpson|majesty .
marge simpson|well , not all of them .
marge simpson|like , um , ninety percent ?
marge simpson|i hope no one was hurt .
marge simpson|but you don't go to our church .
marge simpson|apu thinks we can get the money at the casino playing blackjack .
marge simpson|and it's not even against the rules .
marge simpson|not even homer ?
marge simpson|even i saw that .
marge simpson|i guess i can't tell homer .
marge simpson|well , to raise money , we're ^
marge simpson|putting on a revue .
marge simpson|yeah , so , uh , i'm going out to rehearse ^
marge simpson|the revue .
marge simpson|huh ?
marge simpson|oh , yeah , yeah , yeah ^
marge simpson|the revue .
marge simpson|uh ^
marge simpson|pop culture and current events .
marge simpson|both .
marge simpson|okay ^
marge simpson|there's a song about , um ^
marge simpson|how democrats and republicans can't get along .
marge simpson|it's called cats and dogs .
marge simpson|disguises ?
marge simpson|i'm worried that our scam is becoming dishonest .
marge simpson|ok , mel .
marge simpson|i'll be at the casino by ten .
marge simpson|meet me at the lounge by the j .
marge simpson|geils cover band .
marge simpson|actually ^
marge simpson|my friends and i are using a system to win money to save the church .
marge simpson|it's not gambling !
marge simpson|it's math .
marge simpson|it's not a takedown !
marge simpson|and i haven't told him about it yet .
marge simpson|but it's okay for you guys to know , because you're finally grownup enough to be trusted with adult information .
marge simpson|i'll tell your dad everything in the morning when we have the money .
marge simpson|but until then , i appreciate you keeping this very grownup secret .
marge simpson|homie , homie , i can finally tell you how we really got the money ^
marge simpson|this is all my fault .
marge simpson|homie .
marge simpson|how did you end up at the casino ?
marge simpson|reverend !
marge simpson|reverend !
marge simpson|they took homer !
marge simpson|if we don't give back the money we won counting cards , the casino people are going to hurt homer !
marge simpson|god's plan ?
marge simpson|god isn't some video gamer up there controlling us like we were pac men and dig dugs !
marge simpson|god isn't sky police .
marge simpson|god didn't do this .
marge simpson|i lied to my husband , and made my kids lie too !
marge simpson|we did this .
marge simpson|i'm going to do what i should've done in the first place .
marge simpson|i don't know if you watch us all the time , or if we're just like an ant farm you got for your birthday and left on the shelf , and every once in a while you check out what kind of crazy tunnels we've built .
marge simpson|maybe we got it all wrong praying for things we want and hoping we get them .
marge simpson|maybe prayer is just taking a moment to tell yourself that there is good in the universe .
marge simpson|and i'm going to sit here and focus on that good , and maybe , just maybe , i'll get my husband back .
marge simpson|my family loves your microwave lasagnas .
marge simpson|i want my husband back !
marge simpson|they sure did ^
marge simpson|casino management .
marge simpson|but we don't need to come back .
marge simpson|we saved the church .
marge simpson|homie , after all this , do you still believe in god ?
marge simpson|ooo , careful , homer .
marge simpson|sorry , excuse us .
marge simpson|pardon me ^
marge simpson|oh ^
marge simpson|lisa's class .
marge simpson|isn't bart sweet , homer ?

marge simpson|we could look this id thing up in the dictionary .
marge simpson|i think it's under the short leg of the couch .
marge simpson|and a short temper .
marge simpson|he's a good boy now , and he's getting better , and sometimes even the best sheep stray from the flock and need to be hugged extra hard .
marge simpson|hello again , principal skinner .

marge simpson|you'll find a job .
marge simpson|you've caused plenty of industrial accidents and you've always bounced back .
marge simpson|are you all right , homer ?
marge simpson|well , i've been thinking , too .
marge simpson|you know , homer , you've always been such a good provider , but when we got married , mr berger promised i could come back to my old job anytime i wanted .
marge simpson|sure !
marge simpson|you never forget .
marge simpson|it's just like riding a bicycle .

marge simpson|do you think we should leave the kids unsupervised ?
marge simpson|uhhuh .
marge simpson|well , uh ^
marge simpson|i sense greatness in my family .
marge simpson|well , it's a greatness that others can't see , but it's there and if it's not true greatness we have , we're at least average .
marge simpson|i don't want to alarm anyone , but i think there's a li'l alkeyhol in this punch .
marge simpson|here we sit enjoying the shade .
marge simpson|drink the drink that i have made .
marge simpson|he's here at last my one and only .
marge simpson|goodbye friends and don't be lonely .
marge simpson|hey homie .

marge simpson|sorry .
marge simpson|ohhh , homie .
marge simpson|i think i'm going to be sick .
marge simpson|homie , get in the car .
marge simpson|ohh !
marge simpson|but homer , how long are we supposed to sit here and listen to you badmouth us to the man upstairs ?
marge simpson|maybe we should move to a larger community .
marge simpson|look , napkins .
marge simpson|they're having a conversation .
marge simpson|they actually enjoy talking to each other .
marge simpson|homer , this is our house .
marge simpson|are you coming in , homer ?

marge simpson|but we don't have that kind of money .

marge simpson|eightyeight dollars and fifty cents .
marge simpson|homer , couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead ?
marge simpson|all our money , the college funds , the tv .
marge simpson|homer , you're driving a stake through the hearts of those who love you .
marge simpson|now , doctor , that's not true .
marge simpson|i don't know ^
marge simpson|are we cured yet ?
marge simpson|bart , how could you shock your little sister ?
marge simpson|bart !

marge simpson|arrrgh !
marge simpson|gee , i thought we were making real progress .
marge simpson|homer , how wonderful .

marge simpson|shouldn't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our tv back ?
marge simpson|oh , homer ^
marge simpson|we love you .
marge simpson|uhuh , homer .
marge simpson|lisa's making these for her teacher .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|that's better , homer .
marge simpson|be brave .
marge simpson|bye bye , bart .
marge simpson|you were always my special little guy .
marge simpson|bart , what happened to you ?
marge simpson|a bully ?
marge simpson|well , bart , i hope you're going straight to the principal about this .
marge simpson|what on earth are you talking about , homer ?
marge simpson|oh homer , that's ridiculous .
marge simpson|bart , instead of fighting , why don't you try a little understanding ?
marge simpson|shh !
marge simpson|this bully friend of yours ^
marge simpson|is he a little on the chunky side ?
marge simpson|huh huh .
marge simpson|and i'll bet he doesn't do well in his studies either .
marge simpson|that's why he lashes out at the world .
marge simpson|so tomorrow , instead of bickering with this boy , talk to him .
marge simpson|you'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go .
marge simpson|are you boys through playing war ?
marge simpson|good .
marge simpson|then here are some cupcakes .
marge simpson|oh , homer , you'd lose your head if it weren't securely fastened to your neck .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , everybody .
marge simpson|but i've only got two cupcakes for the three of you .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|but they sent a note from school .
marge simpson|no , bart .
marge simpson|this note isn't about you .
marge simpson|lisa , honey , why don't we go upstairs and i'll draw you a nice hot bath ?
marge simpson|that helps me when i feel sad .
marge simpson|homer , wake up !
marge simpson|wake up !
marge simpson|oh my , here let me wipe off that drool .
marge simpson|well , i'm still trying to figure out what's bothering lisa .
marge simpson|i don't know , bart's such a handful , and maggie needs attention , but all the while our little lisa's becoming a young woman .
marge simpson|good night , homer .
marge simpson|lisa , get away from that jazzman !
marge simpson|come on , come on .
marge simpson|we were worried about you .
marge simpson|nothing personal .
marge simpson|i just fear the unfamiliar .
marge simpson|no , i'm very upset .
marge simpson|i'm upset about lisa .
marge simpson|do you think you're being nice enough to your sister , bart ?
marge simpson|you do love her , don't you ?
marge simpson|well you do , don't you ?
marge simpson|okay , bart , you don't have to say it , but you do have to have a loving attitude .
marge simpson|be nice to your sister .
marge simpson|go on , bart .
marge simpson|no time like the present .
marge simpson|lisa , you'll be late for band practice .
marge simpson|let's go .
marge simpson|now , lisa , listen to me .
marge simpson|this is important .
marge simpson|i want you to smile today .
marge simpson|well , it doesn't matter how you feel inside , you know .
marge simpson|it's what shows up on the surface that counts .
marge simpson|that's what my mother taught me .
marge simpson|take all your bad feelings and push them down , all the way down , past your knees , until you're almost walking on them .
marge simpson|and then you'll fit in , and you'll be invited to parties , and boys will like you ^
marge simpson|and happiness will follow .
marge simpson|come on .
marge simpson|you can do better than that .
marge simpson|ah , that's my girl .
marge simpson|lisa , i apologize to you .
marge simpson|i was wrong .
marge simpson|i take it all back .
marge simpson|always be yourself .
marge simpson|you want to be sad , honey , be sad .
marge simpson|we'll ride it out with you .
marge simpson|and when you get finished feeling sad , we'll still be there .
marge simpson|from now on , let me do the smiling for both of us .
marge simpson|i said you could stop smiling , lisa .
marge simpson|boys , i'd like your attention , please .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , but this is more important than that silly , loud game .
marge simpson|oh , calm down , homer .
marge simpson|lisa has an idea that she thinks would be fun for the whole family .
marge simpson|we're just browsing , thank you .
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|i'm not sure that we can afford ^
marge simpson|i don't think we can afford this , homer .
marge simpson|it all seems so expensive ^
marge simpson|used , isn't it ?
marge simpson|what are you two doing back there ?
marge simpson|homer , i'm telling you this is not the interstate .
marge simpson|shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for directions ?
marge simpson|my feet are getting wet !
marge simpson|we all are , dear .
marge simpson|your father says there's nothing to worry about .
marge simpson|oh , homer .
marge simpson|what are we going to do ?
marge simpson|it is ?
marge simpson|oh , i don't think they'll be gone long and she's in good hands , lisa .
marge simpson|the boys certainly are taking a long time .
marge simpson|i hope maggie isn't slowing them up too much .
marge simpson|oh , i'm sure they're just fine .
marge simpson|after all , we built a fire and we don't know anything about nature .
marge simpson|imagine what your father , an experienced woodsman , has done .
marge simpson|goodnight , dear .
marge simpson|there is ?
marge simpson|why ^
marge simpson|that's my husband !
marge simpson|his name isn't bigfoot .
marge simpson|his name is homer .
marge simpson|i don't understand .
marge simpson|what's this all about ?
marge simpson|well , i suppose pork chops are his favorite .
marge simpson|is this going to be on tv ?
marge simpson|cheer up , homer .
marge simpson|at least they let you go .
marge simpson|oh , homer ^
marge simpson|my brilliant beast .
marge simpson|kids , we're late for church .
marge simpson|get your butts down here right now .
marge simpson|very nice , maggie .
marge simpson|and lisa you look lovely .
marge simpson|bart , assume the position .
marge simpson|oh , bart .
marge simpson|now where's your father ?
marge simpson|let's go , homer .
marge simpson|oh homer , you promised me ^
marge simpson|why should i feel like a traffic cop every sunday morning when i'm just trying to get a little goodness into the family .
marge simpson|c'mon everybody , we're late .
marge simpson|bart , i want you to promise me you'll pay attention in sunday school .
marge simpson|bart ?
marge simpson|bart ?
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|what's this ?
marge simpson|a personal stereo ?
marge simpson|were you going to listen to rock music in sunday school ?
marge simpson|can you believe this , homer ?
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|were you planning on sitting in the car till the game was over ?
marge simpson|it's because of your irreverent attitude that bart thinks he can sneak headphones into sunday school .
marge simpson|now , move it !
marge simpson|yeah .
marge simpson|sit down , homer .
marge simpson|homer , you embarrassed us in front of the whole congregation , and today's sermon was one you should have really listened to .
marge simpson|gambling .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|look , i don't want to talk about this anymore in front of the kids .
marge simpson|lisa , bart , what did you two learn in sunday school today ?
marge simpson|no way , jose .
marge simpson|um mmm .
marge simpson|i know what those movies are like .
marge simpson|killing innocent people , eating human flesh .
marge simpson|you just get a lot of bad ideas .
marge simpson|bart , are you all right ?
marge simpson|well then come down for breakfast .
marge simpson|it's a statue of the trailblazing founder of our town .
marge simpson|go on , lisa .
marge simpson|we've all got to be brave just like jebediah when he killed that bear .
marge simpson|why , bart , why ?
marge simpson|where did you get a ridiculous idea like that ?
marge simpson|homer , did you have something to do with this ?
marge simpson|a little ?
marge simpson|well , isn't this nice ?
marge simpson|no , homer .
marge simpson|it's mine .
marge simpson|ummhmm .
marge simpson|patty , he's out buying me something right now .
marge simpson|i'm sure he doesn't do it deliberately .
marge simpson|well , homer and i had a lovely dining experience at chez pierre ^
marge simpson|or the rusty barnacle is nice ^
marge simpson|the place where the waiters sing .

marge simpson|thank you , bart .
marge simpson|uh ^
marge simpson|ii'm saving it ^
marge simpson|for a special occasion .
marge simpson|but this occasion is already so special if we made it any more special , we might end up making it less special .
marge simpson|well , it's hard for me to judge since i've never bowled in my life .
marge simpson|you bought that bowling ball for you , not for me .
marge simpson|the holes were drilled for your fingers .
marge simpson|you never intended for me to use that ball .
marge simpson|you can't take it back .
marge simpson|you had your name engraved on it .
marge simpson|homer , i'm keeping the ball .
marge simpson|for myself .
marge simpson|hmmm .
marge simpson|i'll just use my ball .
marge simpson|i'm keeping it and i'm going to use it .
marge simpson|thank you for the present , homer .

marge simpson|i know i will .
marge simpson|who is this ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|you don't even know why you're apologizing .
marge simpson|i've been thinking , homer , and you know what bothers me the most about this whole thing ?
marge simpson|you taught bart a very bad lesson .
marge simpson|your boy idolizes you .
marge simpson|yes he does , homer .
marge simpson|and when he sees you treating women as objects , he's going to think that it's okay .
marge simpson|you owe your son better than that , homer .
marge simpson|well , i think you should take bart to meet this exotic bellyperson .
marge simpson|i want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and real feelings .
marge simpson|i want bart to see you apologize for the way you treated her .
marge simpson|do it !
marge simpson|oh , he's sunk even lower !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homer !

marge simpson|oh , homer .
marge simpson|how many times do i have to fluff your pillow ?
marge simpson|well ^
marge simpson|okay .
marge simpson|i know how you like 'em , homer .

marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|you didn't even ask where bart would be going .
marge simpson|but bart doesn't speak french .
marge simpson|well , going to france sounds like a fantastic opportunity , but i think bart should have a say in this .
marge simpson|bart , how would you like to spend the next three months living in france ?
marge simpson|yes , bart .
marge simpson|mmmhmm .

marge simpson|how come all the lights are on ?
marge simpson|i can't tell you how chagrinned we are about all of this .
marge simpson|oh , homer , don't say that .
marge simpson|the way i see it , if you raise three children who can knock out and hogtie a perfect stranger , you must be doing something right .
marge simpson|oh my goodness .
marge simpson|soup's on !
marge simpson|hurry up , or it'll get that icky skin on the top .
marge simpson|in a second , homer .

marge simpson|come here .
marge simpson|you are so beautiful to me / you are so beautiful to me / can't you see ?
marge simpson|hello , everyone .
marge simpson|you know , halloween is a very strange holiday .
marge simpson|personally , i don't understand it .
marge simpson|kids worshiping ghosts , pretending to be devils ^
marge simpson|things on t .
marge simpson|v .
marge simpson|that are completely inappropriate for younger viewers .
marge simpson|things like the following half hour .
marge simpson|nothing seems to bother my kids , but tonight's show , which i totally wash my hands of , is really scary , so if you have sensitive children , maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight , instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow .
marge simpson|thanks for your attention .
marge simpson|i still can't believe how inexpensive it was .
marge simpson|well , he certainly must have been motivated .
marge simpson|prime location , eighteen bedrooms , moat ^
marge simpson|we shouldn't be able to afford this .
marge simpson|it just seems too good to be true .
marge simpson|what on earth was that ?
marge simpson|hmmm .
marge simpson|this kitchen certainly could use a woman's touch .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|what's this thing in the corner ?
marge simpson|evil !
marge simpson|children , get your coats .
marge simpson|we're leaving this house right now .
marge simpson|i'm not going to live in a house of evil just to save a few dollars .
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|but if anything happens ^
marge simpson|i'm in the kitchen , homer !
marge simpson|what's going on out here ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|lisa !
marge simpson|maggie !
marge simpson|stop it !
marge simpson|that does it .
marge simpson|children , get dressed .
marge simpson|we're leaving .
marge simpson|i don't care what i said .
marge simpson|this family has had its differences , and we've squabbled , but we never had knife fights before ^
marge simpson|and i blame this house .
marge simpson|let's go , children .
marge simpson|homer ^
marge simpson|shush !
marge simpson|shut up !
marge simpson|quit trying to push us around .
marge simpson|stop saying those horrible things and show some manners .
marge simpson|look at me .
marge simpson|i've never been so angry .
marge simpson|my hands are shaking .
marge simpson|don't talk to her like that .
marge simpson|oh , don't call me lady .
marge simpson|my name is marge simpson , this is my family and we're not going anywhere .
marge simpson|we're all going to have to live together , so you better get used to it ^
marge simpson|please .
marge simpson|sure .
marge simpson|homer , all these flies .
marge simpson|you ^
marge simpson|you speak english .
marge simpson|well , thank you very much , mr ^
marge simpson|ewww .
marge simpson|look , homer !
marge simpson|radish rosettes .
marge simpson|these are hard to make .
marge simpson|they are a very advanced race .
marge simpson|sorry .
marge simpson|your game is very nice .
marge simpson|will we be invited ?
marge simpson|for a superior race , they really rub it in .
marge simpson|lisa , see what we mean when we say you're too smart for your own good ?
marge simpson|like what ?
marge simpson|children , bedtime .
marge simpson|homer , i am not sleeping with the lights on .
marge simpson|they're just children's stories .
marge simpson|they can't hurt you .
marge simpson|well leave it to good old mary bailey to finally step in and do something about that hideous genetic mutation .
marge simpson|you're late for work , homer .
marge simpson|homer , we're a mary bailey family .
marge simpson|well , frankly , i don't see how one of the most despicable men who ever lived has a chance against mary bailey , the most beloved governor our great state has ever known .
marge simpson|i wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish .
marge simpson|homer ^
marge simpson|i'm a bailey booster .
marge simpson|what !
marge simpson|absolutely not !
marge simpson|huh uh .
marge simpson|i'm going to be ringing doorbells for mary bailey that night .
marge simpson|well i think the noncard question is a valid one .
marge simpson|no , i'm just fine right here .
marge simpson|well , i don't feel like snuggling .
marge simpson|i don't want to snuggle with anybody who's not letting me express myself .
marge simpson|okay , homer .
marge simpson|fair enough .
marge simpson|you got it !
marge simpson|all right !
marge simpson|good !
marge simpson|that's it .
marge simpson|that's how i'm gonna express myself .
marge simpson|that's right .
marge simpson|goodnight .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , dear .
marge simpson|it will all be over soon .
marge simpson|lisa , you're learning many lessons tonight and one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt .
marge simpson|can i have your plate , mr burns ?
marge simpson|homer ^
marge simpson|homer ^
marge simpson|make them stop .
marge simpson|homer , when a man's biggest dreams include seconds on dessert , occasional snuggling , and sleeping till noon on weekends , no one man can destroy them .
marge simpson|i hope you'll space out the tubs this year , homer .
marge simpson|well , last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire .
marge simpson|well , he's a fine role model .
marge simpson|bart , give me that ball !
marge simpson|here you go , bart .
marge simpson|homer ^
marge simpson|homer ^
marge simpson|x .
marge simpson|y .
marge simpson|z .
marge simpson|all this means is you can't wave your fanny in public .
marge simpson|now , homer .
marge simpson|did the team ask you to dress like that , homer ?
marge simpson|a simpson on a tshirt .
marge simpson|i never thought i'd see the day .
marge simpson|homer , i'd be lying if i didn't say that this scares me a little .
marge simpson|but we all have a calling , a reason the almighty put us on this earth .
marge simpson|and yours might be to dance on dugouts .
marge simpson|let's do it , homer !
marge simpson|well , we have one quick stop and then it's on to capital city .
marge simpson|look !
marge simpson|the crosstown bridge !
marge simpson|look , it's tony bennett !
marge simpson|fourth street and d !
marge simpson|awww .
marge simpson|come to bed , homie .
marge simpson|see you after the game , when you're a big star .
marge simpson|let's see .
marge simpson|upper , upper , upper mezzanine .
marge simpson|hmmm .
marge simpson|yes , these must be ours .
marge simpson|you'd think the player's wives would be a little closer to the action .
marge simpson|i don't know .
marge simpson|would you like some fruit juice ?
marge simpson|now stop it you two .
marge simpson|and don't look too down .
marge simpson|i'm sure this is hard enough for your father .
marge simpson|now , now , homer .
marge simpson|bart's busy working on his science project .
marge simpson|homie , quit tossing .
marge simpson|what exactly did he say ?
marge simpson|well , how did he say it ?
marge simpson|was he angry ?
marge simpson|was he rude ?
marge simpson|homer , i'm your best friend , but i've gotta say , i've never seen him be anything but a perfect neighbor .
marge simpson|well , he's not perfect , but he is very ^
marge simpson|i think it's terrible .
marge simpson|a man opens his heart and you make fun of him .
marge simpson|now , just a minute .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|i wish this family was as close as the flanders .
marge simpson|hmmm .
marge simpson|i was going to wash my hair .
marge simpson|you brought food ^
marge simpson|homer , i couldn't help overhearing you warp bart's mind .
marge simpson|well , i'm worried that you're making too big a deal of this silly little kiddie golf tournament .
marge simpson|well , i'm sure it is , but why do we want to do that ?
marge simpson|the father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's sunday dress .
marge simpson|now i suppose you both have to sign this .
marge simpson|i hope blood won't be necessary .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|here you go , bart .
marge simpson|a lumberjack's breakfast for my little golfer .
marge simpson|ohhh , well , what won't make him logy ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|oh , my best dress .
marge simpson|homer , you promised to be nice to my sisters .
marge simpson|honey , please .
marge simpson|you're in the way .
marge simpson|well , okay .
marge simpson|let's see ^
marge simpson|can you do the cranberry sauce ?
marge simpson|the can is in the cupboard on the bottom shelf .
marge simpson|no , no , no , the other shelf .
marge simpson|open the can .
marge simpson|it's in the second drawer from the right .
marge simpson|no , no , no , no , the other one .
marge simpson|i don't think that it's broken , honey .
marge simpson|here , let me try .
marge simpson|here you go .
marge simpson|just stick it in the refrigerator when you're done .
marge simpson|bart .
marge simpson|bart ?
marge simpson|homer , shouldn't you go pick up grampa ?
marge simpson|you knew that i was cooking a turkey .
marge simpson|mom !
marge simpson|you made it !
marge simpson|how are you !

marge simpson|dinner !
marge simpson|okay , lisa , we're ready for your centerpiece !
marge simpson|lisa !

marge simpson|that's very impressive !
marge simpson|now , just wait a minute !
marge simpson|i'm sure there's room for both .
marge simpson|yes , you do !
marge simpson|i hope you're happy , bart !
marge simpson|you've ruined thanksgiving !
marge simpson|oh , why don't i go talk to her ?
marge simpson|honey , your food is getting cold .
marge simpson|lisa , i'm very sorry about what happened .
marge simpson|i've noticed that , too .
marge simpson|well , when you feel like coming down , we'll be there .
marge simpson|bart , you can come down to dinner as soon as you're ready to apologize to your sister .
marge simpson|and it's going to be a real apology in front of everybody , and you have to mean it .
marge simpson|everyone , lisa wants to read us a poem she's written .
marge simpson|oh , no !
marge simpson|my sweet little bart !
marge simpson|and i said he ruined thanksgiving ^
marge simpson|homer , this is a terrible thing that's happened , but we can't blame ourselves .
marge simpson|children need discipline .
marge simpson|you can ask any syndicated advice columnist .
marge simpson|bart ?
marge simpson|you're home !
marge simpson|oh , my special little guy !
marge simpson|we were so worried !
marge simpson|bart , isn't there something you'd like to say to your sister ?
marge simpson|no , no , no !
marge simpson|that won't do at all !
marge simpson|now we can blame him for everything .
marge simpson|lisa's recital is saturday night .
marge simpson|now , come on , you two .
marge simpson|what time does your little truck game start ?
marge simpson|well , lisa's recital starts at five o'clock .
marge simpson|we could go to both .
marge simpson|sit down , homer .
marge simpson|homer , drive defensively .
marge simpson|ooo , i think there's one over there .
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|thank you so much .
marge simpson|hmmm , well , thank you .
marge simpson|gee , everyone's so nice here at the monster truck rally .
marge simpson|look , homer , champagne !
marge simpson|wow , a woman mudpull driver .
marge simpson|yes , well , we saw a daredevil last night and , well , you know , monkey see , monkey do .
marge simpson|what a funfilled evening .
marge simpson|oh , my little boy , .
marge simpson|are you all right ?
marge simpson|gee , i never realized tv was such a dangerous influence .
marge simpson|homer , you're his father .
marge simpson|you've got to try and reason with him .
marge simpson|oh , come on , homer .
marge simpson|a heart to heart talk with your son , you've got to try .
marge simpson|how'd it go , homer ?
marge simpson|well , he's got a pretty good father .
marge simpson|a dash of rosemary ^
marge simpson|a smidgin of thyme ^
marge simpson|a pinch of marjoram ^
marge simpson|oh now , homer , they're nothing special .
marge simpson|the extra ingredient is care .
marge simpson|a sprinkle of chervil , half a teaspoon of turmeric ^
marge simpson|and a whisper of msg .
marge simpson|you don't have to go to all that trouble just for me .
marge simpson|humph ^
marge simpson|where would an innocent child get the idea to attack her father with a mallet ?
marge simpson|no , maggie !
marge simpson|bad baby !
marge simpson|so television's responsible .
marge simpson|well , you won't be watching these cartoons anymore .
marge simpson|ever .
marge simpson|i wonder why bart and lisa are so late getting home from school ?
marge simpson|because .
marge simpson|because i said so .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|i'm trying to work !
marge simpson|i'm cataloguing the violence in these cartoons .
marge simpson|i don't think adults have ever actually sat down and watched them before .
marge simpson|what kind of warped human being would find that funny ?
marge simpson|this is the kind of entertainment they think is suitable for younger and more impressionable viewers ?
marge simpson|i'll tell you what i'm going to do .
marge simpson|i'm going to write a letter .
marge simpson|dear purveyors of senseless violence i know this may sound silly at first ^
marge simpson|but i believe that the cartoons you show to our children are influencing their behavior in a negative way ^
marge simpson|please try to tone down the psychotic violence ^
marge simpson|in your otherwise fine programming .
marge simpson|yours truly , marge simpson .
marge simpson|and the horse i rode in on !
marge simpson|well , that's what we want them to do , homer .
marge simpson|well , i've never changed the world before , so i don't know how long it takes exactly .
marge simpson|but if enough people take an interest ^
marge simpson|snuh !
marge simpson|for nonviolence , understanding and helping .
marge simpson|i've started a crusade against cartoon violence .
marge simpson|i can protect my own children .
marge simpson|but there are many others whose minds are being warped every afternoon at four .
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|have fun .
marge simpson|and what happens when a child grows up with insanely violent role models like these ?
marge simpson|the answer is all around you .
marge simpson|how many of you were hit on the head with mallets last week ?
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i'm sorry about the dinners .
marge simpson|i'll make up for it tomorrow night .
marge simpson|no one .
marge simpson|hmmm , sure .
marge simpson|oh , dear .
marge simpson|i can't .
marge simpson|i've got three protest rallies tomorrow .
marge simpson|what do we want ?
marge simpson|when do we want it ?
marge simpson|what do we want ?
marge simpson|violencein children'sprogramming .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|you're ruining the show .
marge simpson|oh ^
marge simpson|oh ^
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|stop .
marge simpson|please stop .
marge simpson|please .
marge simpson|be quiet .
marge simpson|oh , please .
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|i'm trying to earn a living here .
marge simpson|all right !
marge simpson|stop !
marge simpson|stop !
marge simpson|so much needless brutality .
marge simpson|i don't know if i'm having any impact at all .
marge simpson|mmmmmmmph !
marge simpson|what is it ?
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|smartline ?
marge simpson|yes , i've heard of your latenight panel discussion show .
marge simpson|well , i'd love to .
marge simpson|excuse me .
marge simpson|excuse me .
marge simpson|he was addressing me .
marge simpson|excuse me .
marge simpson|there is !
marge simpson|i think that it's a bad influence on children .
marge simpson|ohhh .
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|i'd like to ask all the parents in springfield who are concerned about this to write in and let the cartoon makers know how you feel .
marge simpson|thank you .
marge simpson|hello ?
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|yes ?
marge simpson|well ^
marge simpson|what's the problem you're having ?
marge simpson|huh huh .
marge simpson|oh dear !
marge simpson|well ^
marge simpson|let's see ^
marge simpson|oh !
marge simpson|couldn't itchy share his pie with scratchy ?
marge simpson|then they would both have pie .
marge simpson|it's time for krusty .
marge simpson|yes , dear .
marge simpson|all you want .
marge simpson|i think it conveys a very nice message of sharing .
marge simpson|aren't you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons ?
marge simpson|so what did you kids do today ?
marge simpson|that's nice dear .
marge simpson|sure .
marge simpson|i didn't really expect things to change this much .
marge simpson|what in the world ?
marge simpson|hmmm , but that's michelangelo's david .
marge simpson|it's a masterpiece !
marge simpson|but i like that statue .
marge simpson|i'm not .
marge simpson|i think everyone in springfield should see it .
marge simpson|hmmm ^
marge simpson|yes and no .
marge simpson|well ^
marge simpson|i guess i can't , which is a shame because i really hate those cartoons .
marge simpson|um , i don't know .
marge simpson|i guess one person can make a difference , but most of the time , they probably shouldn't .
marge simpson|david .
marge simpson|oh , homie .
marge simpson|here the kids have a chance to see a great work of art and instead they're home watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other .
marge simpson|really , why ?
marge simpson|aw , well isn't that nice .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|oh , bart !
marge simpson|we thought for a minute you'd gone away from us .
marge simpson|mr hutz , this is hardly the time or place to discuss this .
marge simpson|is he well enough for me to start mothering him unbearably , doctor ?
marge simpson|hmmm .
marge simpson|oh !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|that's right , he did .
marge simpson|excuse me , but dr hibbert has been our family physician for years , and he thought bart was fine .
marge simpson|well , maybe lisa does have a point .
marge simpson|i don't mind you boys doing this in the living room , but in court doesn't bart have to tell the truth ?
marge simpson|i didn't know you liked animals .
marge simpson|goodness !
marge simpson|i don't know .
marge simpson|maybe we should take his money and put all this ugliness behind us .
marge simpson|what do you think , homer ?
marge simpson|homer , what's happened to you ?
marge simpson|do you know what i'd settle for if it was up to me ?
marge simpson|bart's medical bills and an apology !
marge simpson|yes , i do .
marge simpson|yes , he's been our family physician and trusted friend ever since the day i became a mother .
marge simpson|he's seen us through everything from colds to impetigo with competence and loving care .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , but my mother always said , if you can't say anything nice , don't say anything at all .
marge simpson|well , to be honest , he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping bart in bandages than in making him feel better .
marge simpson|and he mispronounced words that even i know , like abdomen .
marge simpson|and his office was dirty .
marge simpson|now that i think about it , i'm not sure he's even a doctor .
marge simpson|well , i don't know how intense it was ^
marge simpson|so i guess that may not count as anguish .
marge simpson|all that time .
marge simpson|well , we pay bart five dollars a week to take out the trash ^
marge simpson|i suppose if he'd been able to do it that week , we might have given him the five dollars .
marge simpson|umhmm .
marge simpson|homer , would you like some more macaroni and cheese ?
marge simpson|some string beans ?
marge simpson|some celery with cream cheese on it ?
marge simpson|bart , please .
marge simpson|sure .
marge simpson|my woman's intuition is telling me something ^
marge simpson|i wonder what ^
marge simpson|oh my god .
marge simpson|my name is marge .
marge simpson|homer , i'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing .
marge simpson|what are you saying , homer ?
marge simpson|oh my lord .
marge simpson|well , i don't want to wait another minute to find out whether you love me anymore .
marge simpson|i think that you should look me in the eyes and find out .
marge simpson|homer , look at me .
marge simpson|i love you too !
marge simpson|your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds , homer .
marge simpson|get it while it's unbelievably hot , kids !
marge simpson|well , maybe lisa's right .
marge simpson|tomorrow night it might be nice to go out for dinner .
marge simpson|there's that new sushi restaurant on elm street .
marge simpson|please , homer .
marge simpson|can't we try it ?
marge simpson|what would you recommend for a family that's not sure they should be here ?
marge simpson|i'll have one of those .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , homer .
marge simpson|have you thought about what you want to tell the kids ?
marge simpson|well , have you decided what you want to do tomorrow ?
marge simpson|when we're intimate ?
marge simpson|can i just make one suggestion ?
marge simpson|can we get up early and watch the sunrise together ?
marge simpson|you looked so peaceful lying there .
marge simpson|because sometimes it's fun to dress up for dinner .
marge simpson|because sometimes it's fun to use the good china .
marge simpson|sometimes it's fun to use candles .
marge simpson|because we love your father and enjoy his company .
marge simpson|oh , where can he be ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|i wrote a poem for you this afternoon , homer .
marge simpson|it's called , to a husband .
marge simpson|ahem .
marge simpson|the blackened clouds are forming ^
marge simpson|soon the rain will fall / my dear one is departing/ but first please heed this call / that always will i love you / my one , my love , my all .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|oh , homer , homer .
marge simpson|his drool !
marge simpson|it's warm !
marge simpson|he's alive !
marge simpson|homer , homer , wake up , you're alive !
marge simpson|wake up !
marge simpson|you're alive !
marge simpson|you're alive !
marge simpson|you're alive !
marge simpson|i think this is sick .
marge simpson|they're staring at a dot !
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|it's not the end of the world .
marge simpson|you know , before we got married we hardly ever watched television .
marge simpson|no , it's true , bart .
marge simpson|we used to shoot pool ^
marge simpson|and go dancing ^
marge simpson|and a lot of times we'd stay at home and talk , just like this .
marge simpson|pick one .
marge simpson|uh ^
marge simpson|well ^
marge simpson|lisa , i'd rather tell you a different story .
marge simpson|how your father and i first met and fell in love .
marge simpson|we were seniors in high school , but we had never even met .
marge simpson|i'm for equal rights .
marge simpson|but do we really need a whole amendment ?
marge simpson|not if i have to do heavy lifting or math .
marge simpson|oh , the shop kids are smoking again .
marge simpson|and in another article , i found out that to hire professionals to do all the jobs of a housewife , who incidentally is not married to a house , would cost fortyeight thousand dollars a year !
marge simpson|the first step to liberation is to free ourselves from these ^
marge simpson|male imposed shackles .
marge simpson|hm , i guess it's the tissue paper inside .
marge simpson|well , no i don't .
marge simpson|actually , i never really ^
marge simpson|excuse me , is this room 106 ?
marge simpson|i'm a political prisoner .
marge simpson|last time i ever take a stand .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , i don't even know your name .
marge simpson|bringing up a son , even a blind one , isn't a lifetime occupation .
marge simpson|now , the more you help him ^
marge simpson|the more you hurt him .
marge simpson|well thank you , artie .
marge simpson|hello .
marge simpson|yes , i remember .
marge simpson|well , i don't think you're my type .
marge simpson|hmm , i don't know .
marge simpson|i'm sorry .
marge simpson|well , you seem like a nice enough guy , but i really don't have the time .
marge simpson|and the city forensics championship is coming up .
marge simpson|oh , and ii tutor part time .
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|just those who need help with french .
marge simpson|why is there makeout music on ?
marge simpson|well , not me .
marge simpson|shut it off and let's get down to business .
marge simpson|bien .
marge simpson|bien .
marge simpson|tres bien .
marge simpson|well , i should probably be going .
marge simpson|i have a big forensics meet tomorrow .
marge simpson|homer , you're amazing .
marge simpson|before you couldn't say bon jour .
marge simpson|but now you can conjugate all the regular verbs , two irregular verbs , and sing the first verse of allouette .
marge simpson|yeah !
marge simpson|consonants .

marge simpson|for five generations , women in our family have each added a square to it .
marge simpson|now it's your turn .
marge simpson|oh yes , you do .
marge simpson|you just don't know it .
marge simpson|the memory of a million dropstitches flows in your veins .
marge simpson|you try it .
marge simpson|you just need to develop a callous .

marge simpson|i didn't know then , and i don't know now .
marge simpson|those are very elaborate sneakers .
marge simpson|a hundred and twentyfive dollars !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|i thought we agreed to consult each other before any major purchases .
marge simpson|well , homer .
marge simpson|there seems to be a lot of good obedience schools here .
marge simpson|oooh , this one looks very reputable .
marge simpson|oh , i don't know , i just dip in and out ^
marge simpson|i'm only watching today because brandy is coming out of her coma and she knows the phony prince's body is hidden in the boathouse ^
marge simpson|ohh , that dog !
marge simpson|i don't know .
marge simpson|hm .
marge simpson|come on , homer .
marge simpson|i want you to see what your sick little girl did .
marge simpson|my quilt !
marge simpson|six generations , gone .
marge simpson|homer , what are you saying ?
marge simpson|no , i'm afraid i agree with your father .
marge simpson|homer , please .
marge simpson|it's not just the quilt .
marge simpson|he's a nice dog , but he chews up everything .
marge simpson|he doesn't obey .
marge simpson|he's not even housebroken .
marge simpson|and we've spent all this money on an obedience school and i don't see any improvement .
marge simpson|oh , all right .
marge simpson|if he passes obedience school , we can keep him .
marge simpson|homer , can't we place this ad after the dog fails his test ?
marge simpson|hmmm , what are you doing , dear ?
marge simpson|aww .
marge simpson|well , you certainly captured the moment .
marge simpson|hmmm .
marge simpson|say goodbye to grampa , everyone .
marge simpson|homer , that's terrible .
marge simpson|we should be teaching the children to treasure the elderly .

marge simpson|well , i think we better set an example .
marge simpson|well , i always enjoy the glass blower at old springfield towne .
marge simpson|dad , don't you want to know where we're going ?
marge simpson|hello .
marge simpson|homer , are you sure this is the right way ?
marge simpson|the road seems to have gotten awfully bumpy .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer , this thing with your dad has had you moping around the house for days .
marge simpson|i think it's time for you to talk to someone who understands .
marge simpson|homer , that suit doesn't leave much to the imagination .
marge simpson|no , maggie !
marge simpson|stay in the shallow end .
marge simpson|now homer , you do have big bones .
marge simpson|oh , homer , don't be jealous .
marge simpson|i was a schoolgirl , the beatles were very popular and i had a crush on them .
marge simpson|now , homer .
marge simpson|we've got steamed vegetables and rice cakes for you .
marge simpson|now , they're only thirtyfive calories apiece .
marge simpson|you can put a little something on top for flavor .
marge simpson|well ^
marge simpson|but mr schindler ^
marge simpson|i was so upset i decided to send the portrait to the only man on earth whose opinion i could truly trust .
marge simpson|i never got any .
marge simpson|and i never painted again .
marge simpson|i think it's a very nice idea .
marge simpson|don't you , homer ?
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|apu !
marge simpson|what are you doing here ?
marge simpson|clever title .
marge simpson|oh , lisa , this was a bad idea .
marge simpson|do you really think so ?

marge simpson|then i'm in the class ?
marge simpson|well , thank you , professor lombardo .
marge simpson|really ?
marge simpson|you're so supportive .
marge simpson|i wish every teacher was like you .

marge simpson|kids .
marge simpson|remember what i told you about showing a little support .
marge simpson|mr burns .
marge simpson|would you like to come in ?
marge simpson|well , no ^
marge simpson|just ringo starr .
marge simpson|i don't think that will be a problem .
marge simpson|well , maybe not , but i have the gift of being able to see inner beauty .
marge simpson|i'm painting his portrait , homer .
marge simpson|now , homer , don't worry .
marge simpson|all i need to do is find mr burns' inner beauty .
marge simpson|what were you like as a boy , mr burns ?
marge simpson|did you have a dog that you loved .
marge simpson|mr burns , she's just a baby .
marge simpson|oh , my .
marge simpson|i'm so sorry , mr burns .
marge simpson|doesn't it bother you that he orders you around like that ?
marge simpson|mr burns , it's hard to discover your inner beauty while you're shouting at an eightyearold girl .
marge simpson|that's wonderful homer , i'm so proud of ^
marge simpson|mr burns , i've had enough of your ^
marge simpson|posing .
marge simpson|i can finish the portrait myself .
marge simpson|homer , what are you doing ?
marge simpson|don't you listen to him .
marge simpson|he's just a mean little s .
marge simpson|o .
marge simpson|b .
marge simpson|i thought there was some good in everybody until i met him .
marge simpson|i don't think i can .
marge simpson|i can't make that man beautiful .
marge simpson|i'm just not good enough .
marge simpson|i guess i'm no artist .
marge simpson|from the desk of ringo starr !
marge simpson|okay , homer .
marge simpson|if you think i can .
marge simpson|umm ^
marge simpson|hello .
marge simpson|my name is marge simpson and i painted this .
marge simpson|maybe you'd like to know what possessed me to do it .
marge simpson|well , i guess i wanted to show that beneath mr burns' fearsome head with its cruel lips , spiteful tongue and evil brain , there was a frail withered body perhaps not long for this world as vulnerable and beautiful as any of god's creatures .
marge simpson|i thought i did .
marge simpson|hmmm , i feel that way about your father .
marge simpson|hmmm , i notice little things about your father , too .
marge simpson|your father does that to me .
marge simpson|lisa , we can talk , but first you have to accept the fact that i feel that way about your father !
marge simpson|hmmm , lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow , and i think you should take her .
marge simpson|hmmm huh .
marge simpson|homer , i've been talking to lisa and i'm concerned about your relationship with her .
marge simpson|homer , please .

c. montgomery burns|a plant employee carrying on like an oversexed orangutan in heat !
c. montgomery burns|this is a family nuclearpower plant , simpson .
c. montgomery burns|our research indicates that over 50 percent of our power is used by women .
c. montgomery burns|i will not have you offending my customers with your bawdy shenanigans !
c. montgomery burns|just a second , simpson !
c. montgomery burns|smithers , would you leave the room for a minute ?
c. montgomery burns|simpson , i am by most measures a successful man .

c. montgomery burns|proceed , smithers .
c. montgomery burns|any suggestions ?
c. montgomery burns|well those are my ideas !

c. montgomery burns|let the fools have their tartar sauce !
c. montgomery burns|hmmm .
c. montgomery burns|brilliant .
c. montgomery burns|who could have ever imagined that simpson's sweeping reforms would pay off so quickly ?
c. montgomery burns|my dear tired old smithers , do i detect a note of jealousy ?
c. montgomery burns|it is time .
c. montgomery burns|give simpson the key .
c. montgomery burns|oh , hey ho , men .
c. montgomery burns|you know i was watching the dumont last night and i happened to catch a fascinating documentary on rommel , the desert fox .

c. montgomery burns|simpson , how old do you think i am ?
c. montgomery burns|i am only eightyone .
c. montgomery burns|you may find this hard to believe ^
c. montgomery burns|but in my salad days , my crowning glory was a bright shock of strawberry blond curls .
c. montgomery burns|ooh , i was big man on campus until my senior year , when i became as bald as a plucked chicken .
c. montgomery burns|you see , simpson , i too know the sting of malepattern baldness .
c. montgomery burns|that's why i'm giving you your old job back .
c. montgomery burns|now get out of here before i reconsider .
c. montgomery burns|hi , ho , faceless employees .
c. montgomery burns|in a few moments the government inspection team will be touring your plant so look busy and keep your mouths shut .
c. montgomery burns|that is all .
c. montgomery burns|hold me , smithers .
c. montgomery burns|i suppose that's normal background radiation ?
c. montgomery burns|the kind you would find in any wellmaintained nuclear facility ?
c. montgomery burns|or , for that matter , playgrounds and hospitals .
c. montgomery burns|i'm as shocked as you are .
c. montgomery burns|now , that shouldn't be .
c. montgomery burns|yeah .
c. montgomery burns|well that's always been like that .

c. montgomery burns|a rested employee is a vigilant employee .
c. montgomery burns|look here , inspector .
c. montgomery burns|could i speak to you privately iin my office ?
c. montgomery burns|oh , look !
c. montgomery burns|some careless person has left thousands and thousands of dollars just lying here on my coffee table .
c. montgomery burns|uh , smithers , why don't we leave the room and hopefully , when we return the pile of money will be gone .
c. montgomery burns|look smithers , the money and a very stupid man are still here .
c. montgomery burns|is there some confusion about this ?
c. montgomery burns|take it !
c. montgomery burns|take it , take it , you poor schmoe .
c. montgomery burns|oh , well ^
c. montgomery burns|a little dab of paint here , a little spackle there ^
c. montgomery burns|how much could it possibly cost to fix this place up ?
c. montgomery burns|fiftysix million !
c. montgomery burns|oh , that i had the strength to take it out on you , smithers .
c. montgomery burns|now please go .
c. montgomery burns|i would be alone .
c. montgomery burns|once i built a railroad / made it run / made it race against time/ once i built a railroad / now it's done / brother can you spare a dime .
c. montgomery burns|/ half a million boots went slogging through hell / i was the kid with the drum .

c. montgomery burns|i'm going to share something with you .
c. montgomery burns|hop in .
c. montgomery burns|homer , they're trying to shut us down .
c. montgomery burns|they say we're contaminating the planet .
c. montgomery burns|why can't the government just get off our backs ?
c. montgomery burns|oh , get off your soapbox , simpson !
c. montgomery burns|do you realize how much it costs to run for office ?
c. montgomery burns|more than any honest man can afford .

c. montgomery burns|huh uh .
c. montgomery burns|huh uh .
c. montgomery burns|huh uh .
c. montgomery burns|yeah .

c. montgomery burns|i'm going to be sore tomorrow .
c. montgomery burns|by the time this paid political announcement is done , every johnny lunchpail in this whole stupid state will be eating out of my hand .
c. montgomery burns|oh , hello friends .
c. montgomery burns|i'm montgomery burns , your next governor , and i'm here to talk to you about my little friend , here .
c. montgomery burns|blinky .
c. montgomery burns|many of you consider him to be a hideous genetic mutation .
c. montgomery burns|nothing could be further from the truth .
c. montgomery burns|but don't take my word for it .
c. montgomery burns|let's ask an actor portraying charles darwin what he thinks .
c. montgomery burns|oh hello , charles .
c. montgomery burns|be a good fellow and tell our viewers about your theory of natural selection .
c. montgomery burns|so ^
c. montgomery burns|you're saying this fish might have an advantage over other fish .
c. montgomery burns|it may , in fact , be a kind of super fish !
c. montgomery burns|no .
c. montgomery burns|you see , friends ^
c. montgomery burns|if our antinuclear naysayers and chooseupsiders were to come upon an elephant frolicking in the waters next to our nuclear power plant , they'd probably blame his ridiculous nose on the nuclear bogeyman .
c. montgomery burns|the truth is this fish is a miracle of nature with a taste that can't be beat .
c. montgomery burns|mmmm mmmm .
c. montgomery burns|so , to summarize say what you want about me .
c. montgomery burns|i can take the slings and arrows .
c. montgomery burns|but stop slandering poor , defenseless blinky .
c. montgomery burns|good night and god bless .
c. montgomery burns|giving me a total of ^
c. montgomery burns|and i say taxes are too high !
c. montgomery burns|have you found any dirt on mary bailey ?

c. montgomery burns|heaven forefend .
c. montgomery burns|oh .

c. montgomery burns|every joe meatball and sally housecoat in this godforsaken state will see me hunkering down for chow with eddie punchclock .
c. montgomery burns|the media will have a field day !
c. montgomery burns|well , i ^
c. montgomery burns|i knew there would be sacrifices .
c. montgomery burns|only an innocent child could get away with such blasphemy .
c. montgomery burns|god bless them all .
c. montgomery burns|amen .
c. montgomery burns|hello , homer .
c. montgomery burns|marge , you look dazzling .

c. montgomery burns|excellent .
c. montgomery burns|goodness !
c. montgomery burns|i didn't realize this casual dinner was going to turn into a charged political debate .
c. montgomery burns|homer , i agree with you and , if i'm elected governor , i will lower taxes whether those bureaucrats in the state capital like it or not .
c. montgomery burns|lisa , do you have a question you would like to ask your uncle montgomery ?
c. montgomery burns|oooh , a tough question , but a fair one .
c. montgomery burns|lisa , there's no single answer .
c. montgomery burns|some voters respond to my integrity .
c. montgomery burns|others are more impressed with my incorruptibility ^
c. montgomery burns|still others by my determination to lower taxes , and the bureaucrats in the state capital can put that in their pipes and smoke it .
c. montgomery burns|some can't even get a fair shake , or even a square deal ^
c. montgomery burns|ummmm , smells delightful .
c. montgomery burns|you must have a few tricks left up your sleeves .
c. montgomery burns|smithers , boil some coffee .
c. montgomery burns|we're not licked yet .
c. montgomery burns|wait !
c. montgomery burns|come back !
c. montgomery burns|you can't do this to me !
c. montgomery burns|i'm charles montgomery burns !
c. montgomery burns|smithers , tip over this table for me !
c. montgomery burns|shut up and wreck something .
c. montgomery burns|she's right .
c. montgomery burns|take me home , smithers .
c. montgomery burns|we'll destroy something tasteful .
c. montgomery burns|ironic , isn't it smithers ?
c. montgomery burns|this anonymous clan of slackjawed troglodytes has cost me the election , and yet if i were to have them killed , i would be the one to go to jail .
c. montgomery burns|that's democracy for you .
c. montgomery burns|simpson , i shall make it the focus of my remaining years that your dreams will go unfulfilled .
c. montgomery burns|ah , the gammills .
c. montgomery burns|good to see you .
c. montgomery burns|well , take your mind off contaminates for one night and have a hot dog .
c. montgomery burns|put a little smile on his card , smithers .
c. montgomery burns|ah , well , if it isn't the simps .

c. montgomery burns|hmmm , oh , oh yes ^
c. montgomery burns|homer and marge simpson .
c. montgomery burns|oh , and these must be bart , lisa and uh , expecting .
c. montgomery burns|heh , heh .
c. montgomery burns|as well they might .
c. montgomery burns|you know , smithers , when i was a young buck , my patented fadeaway pitch was compared by many to the trouble ball of the late great satchel paige .
c. montgomery burns|spit on this for me , smithers .
c. montgomery burns|oh , shut up .
c. montgomery burns|ah , sitting with the employees .
c. montgomery burns|i guess this proves i'm their friend .
c. montgomery burns|you did get me something on an aisle , smithers ?
c. montgomery burns|i don't want to be surrounded by them .
c. montgomery burns|i suppose you want a beer ?
c. montgomery burns|actually , i was wondering if you'd join me .
c. montgomery burns|my treat .
c. montgomery burns|no .
c. montgomery burns|vendor , two , please .
c. montgomery burns|the hitter's off his rocker / kissing betty crocker !

c. montgomery burns|crude , but i like it .
c. montgomery burns|what do you say we freshen up our little drinkie poos ?
c. montgomery burns|well , simpsie , you up for another wave ?
c. montgomery burns|damnation !
c. montgomery burns|these banjos couldn't carry pie traynor's glove .
c. montgomery burns|my one game of the year ^
c. montgomery burns|ruined by pathetic incompetence .
c. montgomery burns|yes .
c. montgomery burns|unfortunately , homer simpson's shameless display of exhibitionism tainted the entire evening .
c. montgomery burns|i want him banned for life from all company outings .
c. montgomery burns|mmmm , delicious .
c. montgomery burns|smithers , every year you outstrip yourself in succulence .
c. montgomery burns|oh , no !
c. montgomery burns|i couldn't eat another bite .
c. montgomery burns|dispose of all this .
c. montgomery burns|i did , however , save room for your special pumpkin pie .
c. montgomery burns|release the hounds !
c. montgomery burns|oh , for crying out loud ^
c. montgomery burns|just give him a nickel and let's get going .
c. montgomery burns|ah , simpson !
c. montgomery burns|at last we meet .

c. montgomery burns|so i'm cutting you a check .
c. montgomery burns|one ^
c. montgomery burns|hundred ^
c. montgomery burns|dollars !
c. montgomery burns|of course you'll have to sign a waiver , relinquishing your right to sue and so forth ^
c. montgomery burns|merely a formality ^
c. montgomery burns|oh , so extortion is the name of your little game , is it simpson ?
c. montgomery burns|very well .
c. montgomery burns|then you get nothing .
c. montgomery burns|i have the finest lawyers in springfield , simpson .

c. montgomery burns|oh , it was a beautiful day .
c. montgomery burns|the sun was shining .

c. montgomery burns|oh , my goodness !
c. montgomery burns|look what's happened !
c. montgomery burns|why you despicable , coldblooded monster .
c. montgomery burns|regardless of what you think , we must summon help , and comfort the dear boy until an ambulance arrives .

c. montgomery burns|and that ugly customer was the last indonesian rhino on earth .
c. montgomery burns|oh , i don't like everything about them , just their heads .
c. montgomery burns|well , would you care for some wine , old buddy ?
c. montgomery burns|bottoms up simpson , there's plenty more where that came from .
c. montgomery burns|yes .
c. montgomery burns|now then , homer , old chum , i'm sure you'll agree with me that this trial is an affront to our collective dignity .
c. montgomery burns|what do you say , we settle this man to man ?
c. montgomery burns|oh , no , i mean i'm prepared to offer you a most generous cash settlement .
c. montgomery burns|a princely sum ^
c. montgomery burns|well , a handsome sum that can end this little embrolio once and for all .
