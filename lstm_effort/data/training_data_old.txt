lisa simpson|how's your marriage ?
lisa simpson|way to go , grampa .
lisa simpson|hurry , mom !
lisa simpson|if we don't get to the convention soon , all the good comics will be gone .
lisa simpson|i think it's sad that you equate friendliness from wimpiness , and i hope it will keep you from ever achieving true popularity .
lisa simpson|hey , they do look alike !
lisa simpson|perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money is , and took his own life .
lisa simpson|he's no wittier than the next superhero .
lisa simpson|i stand corrected .
lisa simpson|too bad we didn't come dressed as popular cartoon characters .
lisa simpson|yeah , mom !
lisa simpson|guess what ?
lisa simpson|for a dollar a man sold me thirtyfive caspers and a dozen lois lanes .

lisa simpson|oh , bart , you ^
lisa simpson|dear bart , i am using the stationery mom and dad gave me for my birthday to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only .
lisa simpson|perhaps if a professional so advises , i will give you a hug at some far distant family reunion , but rest assured it will be purely for show .

lisa simpson|hmm ^
lisa simpson|thanks for driving me to the contest , dad .
lisa simpson|when america was born on that hot july day in 1776 , the trees in springfield forest were tiny saplings , trembling towards the sun .
lisa simpson|and as they were nourished by mother earth , so too did our fledgling nation find strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice .
lisa simpson|who would have thought such mighty oaks , or such a powerful nation , could grow out of something so fragile ^
lisa simpson|so pure .
lisa simpson|thank you .
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|there's no such thing as first bedsies .

lisa simpson|the truth must be told .
lisa simpson|i would like to read a different essay , if i may .
lisa simpson|the city of washington was built on a stagnant swamp some 200 years ago , and very little has changed .
lisa simpson|it stank then , and it stinks now .
lisa simpson|only today , it is the fetid stench of corruption that hangs in the air .
lisa simpson|and who did i see taking a bribe , but the honorable bob arnold .
lisa simpson|but don't worry , congressman , i'm sure you can buy all the votes you need with your dirty money .
lisa simpson|and this will be one nation , under the dollar , with liberty and justice for none .
lisa simpson|i'm sorry , dad .
lisa simpson|i couldn't think of a nice way to say america stinks .
lisa simpson|i can't believe it !

lisa simpson|it's funny how two wrongs sometimes make a right .
lisa simpson|what are you so happy about ?
lisa simpson|no one wants your stupid police badge , bart .
lisa simpson|i'm gonna eat eight pieces of chocolate .
lisa simpson|i think this is something bart would really have enjoyed .
lisa simpson|but it's the only way he'll learn .
lisa simpson|bart , is your boss a crook ?

lisa simpson|looking at you with quiet awe .
lisa simpson|i will , mr gumbel .

lisa simpson|uh , excuse me , i have the chocolate milk .
lisa simpson|he's just a little nervous .
lisa simpson|he has to give a speech tomorrow on how to keep cool in a crisis .
lisa simpson|our dad ^
lisa simpson|now he belongs to the ages .
lisa simpson|no , dad , krusty is our guest .
lisa simpson|your pratfalls and punchinello antics aren't necessary here .
lisa simpson|why don't we let our guest do it ?
lisa simpson|no , dad , that's hebrew .
lisa simpson|krusty must be jewish .
lisa simpson|dad , there are many prominent jewish entertainers including lauren bacall , dinah shore , william shatner , and mel brooks .
lisa simpson|poor krusty , he's like a black velvet painting come to life .
lisa simpson|come on ^

lisa simpson|and if you're playing the radio , she likes contemporary adult in the morning and easy listening at night .
lisa simpson|please take good care of my princess .

lisa simpson|maybe i'm being a little anal , but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there .

lisa simpson|when they find out you've been fooling them , they're gonna want to cut you up with rusty razors .
lisa simpson|the police will catch you sooner or later .
lisa simpson|maybe not , but i bet you're stupid enough to have left a property of bart simpson label on that radio .
lisa simpson|hey , stop that !
lisa simpson|what's going on ?

lisa simpson|he'll lose .
lisa simpson|look at the fear in his eyes .
lisa simpson|listen to the quiver in his voice .
lisa simpson|he's a little boy , lost in a game of men .
lisa simpson|i'd bet my entire college fund on it .
lisa simpson|dad , i hate to break the mood , but i'm getting nauseous .
lisa simpson|well , i like the 49ers because they're pure of heart seattle because they got something to prove and the raiders because they always cheat .

lisa simpson|you know , dad , sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week .
lisa simpson|mom , can't a man do something nice for his loved ones ?

lisa simpson|the happiest day of my life was three sundays ago .
lisa simpson|i was sitting on my daddy's knee when the saints , who were four and a half point favorites , but only up by three , kicked a meaningless field goal at the last second , to cover the spread .
lisa simpson|oh dad , you must've bought me every malibu stacey accessory there is .
lisa simpson|you know , dad , we've been watching a lot of tv lately .
lisa simpson|maybe , the sunday after the super bowl , we could hike up to the top of mount springfield .
lisa simpson|the fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets .
lisa simpson|what about daddydaughter day ?
lisa simpson|so that's it .
lisa simpson|you just wanted me to help you gamble .
lisa simpson|you never wanted to be with me at all .

lisa simpson|so you've come to buy my forgiveness .
lisa simpson|sorry , homer .
lisa simpson|yeah , i did .
lisa simpson|well , i would like to see what all the fuss is about .
lisa simpson|put me down .
lisa simpson|look dad , i'll tell you who's gonna win the super bowl if you want me to .
lisa simpson|but it'll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me .
lisa simpson|i think dallas is a mortal lock .
lisa simpson|however ^
lisa simpson|however , i may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously i want you to lose .
lisa simpson|in which case , i'd bet the farm on buffalo .
lisa simpson|i don't know .
lisa simpson|if i still love you , dallas .

lisa simpson|bart , who's winning ?

lisa simpson|and i may or may not die young , i haven't decided .
lisa simpson|can you tell me if i have what it takes to be a blues musician ?
lisa simpson|but i'll practice every day !
lisa simpson|you're wrong , you're wrong !
lisa simpson|you don't need long fingers to play the blues .
lisa simpson|the blues come from in here !
lisa simpson|my god , they are stubby .
lisa simpson|dear log ^
lisa simpson|this will be my last entry .
lisa simpson|for you were a journal of my hopes and dreams , and now i have none .
lisa simpson|what's so good about it ^
lisa simpson|what's the point ?
lisa simpson|they'll never notice .
lisa simpson|i quit .
lisa simpson|if you think it's so great , why don't you join the band ?
lisa simpson|janey , i'm about ready to chuck the whole stinking alphabet .
lisa simpson|a doy .
lisa simpson|nothin' .
lisa simpson|okay , but if you really want to honk skinner off , i suggest you attack the one thing he truly believes in .
lisa simpson|shove it .
lisa simpson|whattaya got ?
lisa simpson|uh , i'll smoke it in class .
lisa simpson|come on , bart .
lisa simpson|in your prefascist days , you knew the giddy thrill of futile rebellion .
lisa simpson|i don't know .
lisa simpson|you ?
lisa simpson|well , you're earning your eighteen grand a year .
lisa simpson|stupid hoover ^
lisa simpson|thinks she's so smart .
lisa simpson|she wouldn't be so smart without her teacher's edition .
lisa simpson|that's right .
lisa simpson|it was i .
lisa simpson|i know .
lisa simpson|i know .
lisa simpson|bart , why'd you take the blame ?
lisa simpson|oh , bart .
lisa simpson|give it to the poor .
lisa simpson|it's not fair to toy with people's emotions like that .
lisa simpson|he is alive .
lisa simpson|he's wagging his tail .
lisa simpson|checkers .
lisa simpson|thanks , mom .
lisa simpson|but , mom , next week is volume four copernicus through elephantiasis .
lisa simpson|can't you see i'm reading a thirdrate biography of copernicus i found at the bus station ?
lisa simpson|close the gate , maggie .
lisa simpson|here santa's little helper !
lisa simpson|have you found a picture yet ?
lisa simpson|poor santa's little helper .
lisa simpson|i'm starting to think we'll never see him again .
lisa simpson|you already petted him for ten minutes .
lisa simpson|look dad , there's a spot .
lisa simpson|uh , we're getting a lot of sparks over here , dad .
lisa simpson|honey , i hit a school bus !
lisa simpson|just tell me when the scary part's over .
lisa simpson|i guess that executive stress ball we got him for christmas isn't working .
lisa simpson|she's wonderful .
lisa simpson|i could feel her sweet country soul in every digitallyencoded bit .
lisa simpson|i'm sorry ?
lisa simpson|these talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on tv .
lisa simpson|ewww .
lisa simpson|sideshow bob !
lisa simpson|what a beautiful story , sideshow bob .
lisa simpson|you're living proof that our revolving door prison system works .
lisa simpson|come on , bart .
lisa simpson|if krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him , surely you can too .
lisa simpson|i could've been the flower girl .
lisa simpson|and i wouldn't keep falling down either .
lisa simpson|yeah , well if they want to go for cutesiness instead of competence , fine .
lisa simpson|see for yourself .
lisa simpson|i'se just jammin' with you .
lisa simpson|we don't have seatbelts .
lisa simpson|i think you have to be more aggressive , sir .
lisa simpson|did the maniac kill her ?
lisa simpson|how ?
lisa simpson|i gotta help him .
lisa simpson|dad , what if i told you , you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger ?
lisa simpson|according to eternity magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning .
lisa simpson|that's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it .
lisa simpson|they'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep .
lisa simpson|as you hear newage music , a powerful message goes to your brain , telling you to eat less .
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|do you know what today is ?
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|it's two weeks since you got that subliminal weight loss tape .
lisa simpson|let's get you on the scale .
lisa simpson|you've gained thirteen pounds .
lisa simpson|hey bart , according to this magazine , in another million years , man will have an extra finger .
lisa simpson|why didn't you go to dad ?
lisa simpson|well , according to eternity magazine , the feeling of guilt has been linked to the neutrotransmitter gammaphenamine .
lisa simpson|dow chemical is developing a minty gel , which will eliminate excess guilt , but unfortunately it won't be on the market for another six months .
lisa simpson|so i guess you're gonna have to bite the bullet and confess to milhouse .
lisa simpson|we leapt off just in time to see it collapse .
lisa simpson|this award is the biggest farce i ever saw .
lisa simpson|i stand corrected .
lisa simpson|dad , you know you won .
lisa simpson|dad ?
lisa simpson|dad ?
lisa simpson|unky herb !
lisa simpson|why didn't you write , unky herb ?
lisa simpson|i see your point .
lisa simpson|and while on ventnor avenue you'll be staying at the fabulous hotel lisa .
lisa simpson|a valet will be around shortly to park your thimble .
lisa simpson|of course , there is the unpleasant matter of the bill .
lisa simpson|eleven hundred and fifty bones .
lisa simpson|well , i think we should invest in a set of the great books of western civilization .
lisa simpson|look at this ad from new republic for kids .
lisa simpson|each month a new classic will be delivered to our door paradise regained , martin chuzzlewit , or herman melville's twin classics omoo and typee .
lisa simpson|maggie !
lisa simpson|maggie !
lisa simpson|i think we owe a debt to unky herb .
lisa simpson|he took us into his home and dad destroyed him .
lisa simpson|peekaboo !
lisa simpson|finally , a copy of ethan frome to call my own .
lisa simpson|no , dad .
lisa simpson|you promised if bart and i got c averages we could go to kamp krusty .
lisa simpson|and with no false modesty , you're looking at one happy camper .
lisa simpson|i've never gotten a b before .
lisa simpson|how could this have happened ?
lisa simpson|i feel so dirty .
lisa simpson|uh .
lisa simpson|uh ^
lisa simpson|uh .
lisa simpson|the dirt's not coming off .
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|calm down .
lisa simpson|this must just be a little typo .
lisa simpson|oh miss hoover , there appears to be a mistake on my report card .
lisa simpson|you gave me a b+ in conduct .
lisa simpson|perhaps i'm not making myself clear .
lisa simpson|i think you should reconsider .
lisa simpson|so , bart , will you be joining me in the bucolic splendor of kamp krusty ?
lisa simpson|a+ !
lisa simpson|oh , bart , why didn't you at least forge plausible grades ?
lisa simpson|before i go to camp , i'll need boosters for malaria , german measles , encephalitis , hansen's disease ^
lisa simpson|don't patronize me , doctor .
lisa simpson|i'll write you every day .
lisa simpson|if the pets die , don't replace them .
lisa simpson|i'll know !
lisa simpson|this is a little more rustic than i expected .
lisa simpson|are you sure that's safe ?
lisa simpson|you're serving us gruel ?
lisa simpson|i feel like i'm gonna die , bart .
lisa simpson|i meant soon .
lisa simpson|dear mom and dad , i no longer fear hell , because i've been to kamp krusty .
lisa simpson|our nature hikes have become grim death marches .
lisa simpson|our arts and crafts center is , in actuality , a dickensian workhouse .
lisa simpson|bart makes it through the days relying on his unwavering belief that krusty the clown will come through .
lisa simpson|but i am far more pessimistic .
lisa simpson|i am not sure if this letter will reach you as our lines of communication have been cut .
lisa simpson|and now the effort of writing has made me lightheaded .
lisa simpson|so i close by saying , save us !
lisa simpson|save us now !
lisa simpson|bart and lisa .
lisa simpson|he's really having trouble keeping his balance .
lisa simpson|kowalski !
lisa simpson|wiggum !
lisa simpson|crandall !
lisa simpson|bart , you said you were gonna name it camp freedom .
lisa simpson|oh yeah ?
lisa simpson|who played your daughter in the shortlived sitcom , president clown ?
lisa simpson|it is the real krusty .
lisa simpson|look at that pacemaker scar , the cattle skull birthmark , and his famous superfluous nipple .
lisa simpson|yuh huh .
lisa simpson|hey look , it's last year's winner , deborah jo smallwood !
lisa simpson|sorry .
lisa simpson|wow !
lisa simpson|my mother the actress .
lisa simpson|i feel like lucie arnazluckinbill .
lisa simpson|hey , mom , would it help if ah talked lahk this , too ?
lisa simpson|big daddy , would y'all mind passin' a li'l ol' biscuit ?
lisa simpson|it's mom !
lisa simpson|i think it's supposed to symbolize her descent into madness .
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|everybody was cheering for you .
lisa simpson|our father , who art in heaven , hallowed by thy ^
lisa simpson|give it a little more gas .
lisa simpson|no , no , that's too much .
lisa simpson|know what i think would help ?
lisa simpson|nothing .
lisa simpson|dad , can i ask you a question ?
lisa simpson|why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy ?
lisa simpson|truly this was an act of god .
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|oh my god .
lisa simpson|i'm ugly .
lisa simpson|dad , do you think i'm ugly ?
lisa simpson|i'm an ugmo .
lisa simpson|fathers have to say that stuff .
lisa simpson|i'd like to be alone , please .
lisa simpson|i'm hideous .
lisa simpson|so you think i'm ugly ?
lisa simpson|to shut myself off from the world and never be seen by human eyes again .
lisa simpson|what are you talking about ?
lisa simpson|how could you ?
lisa simpson|i won't do it !
lisa simpson|nope .
lisa simpson|but that ride meant everything to him !
lisa simpson|i'll do it .
lisa simpson|she's beautiful .
lisa simpson|i thought those were illegal .
lisa simpson|there's no way i can beat this girl .
lisa simpson|she's the jack nicklaus of the pageant circuit .
lisa simpson|i meant because they both win all the time , mom .
lisa simpson|are we done ?
lisa simpson|isn't this dangerous ?
lisa simpson|it's hopeless .
lisa simpson|do you really think i can win ?
lisa simpson|but those other girls are prettier than me .
lisa simpson|oh bart .
lisa simpson|my name is lisa simpson , and i want to be little miss springfield so i can make our town a better place !
lisa simpson|thanks , dad .
lisa simpson|some people say that to love your country is old fashioned , uncool , real melvin ^
lisa simpson|well to them i say oh beautiful , for spacious skies , for amber waves of grain ^
lisa simpson|one !
lisa simpson|two !
lisa simpson|three !
lisa simpson|four !
lisa simpson|left a good job in the city workin' for the man every night and day ^
lisa simpson|as little miss springfield , it's my pleasure to welcome you to america , the land of opportunity .
lisa simpson|i'd say the greater danger is her scepter acting as a lightning rod .
lisa simpson|unless it's made out of plastic .
lisa simpson|hi fellas .
lisa simpson|i'm going to be riding on a pack of cigarettes ?
lisa simpson|i don't want to be a spokesperson for a cigarette company !
lisa simpson|stop this float !
lisa simpson|i'm tired of being a corporate shill .
lisa simpson|from now i will speak out against the evils in society from dog napping to cigarettes .
lisa simpson|before i sing the national anthem , i'd like to say that college football diverts funds badly needed for education and the arts .
lisa simpson|dad , do you remember why you entered me in that pageant ?
lisa simpson|possibly .
lisa simpson|but the point is , you wanted me to feel better about myself .
lisa simpson|and i do .
lisa simpson|uhhuh .
lisa simpson|it's a deal .
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|you said he went bowling !
lisa simpson|bart , please .

lisa simpson|you cast the wrong spell !
lisa simpson|zombies !
lisa simpson|dad , we did something very bad .
lisa simpson|yes .

lisa simpson|wait bart !
lisa simpson|maybe the library has another book that'll reverse the spell .
lisa simpson|hurry , bart !
lisa simpson|what's wrong ?
lisa simpson|what are we going to have ?
lisa simpson|what if one of us has been good and one of us has been bad ?
lisa simpson|ew !
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|bart , come quick !
lisa simpson|there's an itchy and scratchy movie !
lisa simpson|we got beets !
lisa simpson|dad , i agree that bart should be punished , but the itchy and scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation .
lisa simpson|how would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing ?
lisa simpson|it wasn't that great .
lisa simpson|it was the greatest movie i've ever seen in my life .
lisa simpson|and you wouldn't believe the celebrities who did cameos .
lisa simpson|dustin hoffman , michael jackson ^
lisa simpson|of course they didn't use their real names , but you could tell it was them .
lisa simpson|sorry bart .
lisa simpson|dad , you've got to let bart see that movie .
lisa simpson|i've never seen him like this .
lisa simpson|he has the demented melancholia of a tennessee williams heroine .
lisa simpson|uh ^
lisa simpson|i think it needs a little padding .
lisa simpson|upupup .
lisa simpson|when i'm done .
lisa simpson|mom , they expect you to lie a little .
lisa simpson|well , you voted for him ^
lisa simpson|twice !
lisa simpson|i think it's wonderful .
lisa simpson|mom and dad side by side at the power plant .
lisa simpson|you'll be just like marie and pierre curie .
lisa simpson|they discovered radium .
lisa simpson|then they both died of radiation poisoning .
lisa simpson|i don't think we should be down here .

lisa simpson|bart , you can't go on like this .
lisa simpson|we're a family again !
lisa simpson|you were in that coma for seven weeks .
lisa simpson|it's so sad that krusty is ashamed of his roots .
lisa simpson|lois sanborn .
lisa simpson|this is a rather lifeless outing .
lisa simpson|that's as bad as the tasteless itchy and sambo cartoons of the late 30s .
lisa simpson|the writers should be ashamed of themselves .
lisa simpson|yeah , sort of .
lisa simpson|write a cartoon ourselves ?
lisa simpson|bart , are you thinking what i'm thinking ?
lisa simpson|according to this book , the first thing we need is a setting .
lisa simpson|great .
lisa simpson|scratchy is getting a haircut .
lisa simpson|then itchy the barber chops scratchy's head off with a razor !

lisa simpson|look there's only one reasonable way to settle this rock , paper , scissors .
lisa simpson|paper .
lisa simpson|bart , they rejected our script .
lisa simpson|maybe he just doesn't take us seriously 'cause we're kids .
lisa simpson|let's put a grownup's name on it .

lisa simpson|grampa , how'd you take off your underwear without taking off your pants ?
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|our cartoon's on tv !
lisa simpson|then we put your name on the script and sent it in .
lisa simpson|grampa , we could write the scripts for you and split the money three ways .
lisa simpson|yay !
lisa simpson|wow , it must be expensive to produce all these cartoons .
lisa simpson|they said their insurance won't cover you .
lisa simpson|i guess nobody likes the truth , huh grampa .

lisa simpson|dean martin still packs 'em in .
lisa simpson|but there are still a few things i don't get .
lisa simpson|like how come we never heard about this until today ?
lisa simpson|why haven't you hung up your gold record ?
lisa simpson|the fox network has sunk to a new low .
lisa simpson|it's from my pen pal , anya !

lisa simpson|that's good , dad .
lisa simpson|yeah !

lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|dad , nerds are nothing to fear .
lisa simpson|in fact they've done some pretty memorable things .
lisa simpson|some nerds of note include ;
lisa simpson|popcorn magnate , orville redenbacher , rock star , david byrne and supreme court justice david souter .
lisa simpson|oh , those baby ducks were so cute .
lisa simpson|i can't believe they let us walk right up and feed them .

lisa simpson|the tv !
lisa simpson|the tv !
lisa simpson|it's bad enough they put their retainers in the dishwasher can't we do something ?
lisa simpson|no you didn't .
lisa simpson|you only passed your course by cheating , which you always taught us was wrong .
lisa simpson|actually , mom , a tweaking of mr burns' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn dad a special place in the old man's heart .
lisa simpson|does either of you know what incontinent means ?
lisa simpson|i'd like to believe that this time .
lisa simpson|i really would .
lisa simpson|i knew it .
lisa simpson|bobo .
lisa simpson|it's mr burns' bear all right .
lisa simpson|i think we should just give him the bear that he cherishes so much .
lisa simpson|is it my imagination or is tv getting worse ?
lisa simpson|wait !
lisa simpson|doesn't my father have the right to a fair trial ?
lisa simpson|dad , i wouldn't go outside if i were you .
lisa simpson|nope .
lisa simpson|it says right there , school bus .
lisa simpson|bart , what's wrong ?
lisa simpson|and ^
lisa simpson|excuse me , bart's a little upset this morning , so could everyone please be extranice to him ?
lisa simpson|no , no , they're wrong !
lisa simpson|the creature they seek is the walking undead .
lisa simpson|nosferatu !
lisa simpson|das wampyre !
lisa simpson|a vampire !
lisa simpson|ah , there's something fishy about this whole setup .
lisa simpson|dad , do you notice anything strange ?
lisa simpson|eww , dad , this is blood .
lisa simpson|whoops .
lisa simpson|bart and i have to go wash up .
lisa simpson|you're probably right .
lisa simpson|let's just go back ^
lisa simpson|satisfied ?
lisa simpson|look !
lisa simpson|oh my god !
lisa simpson|please , bart , i've seen your stupid shemp .
lisa simpson|yeah , i've seen your curly too .
lisa simpson|mom , dad !
lisa simpson|mr burns is a vampire , and he has bart !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|the only way to get bart back is to kill the head vampire , mr burns .
lisa simpson|no , dad .
lisa simpson|you must drive this stake right through his heart .
lisa simpson|uh , dad , that's his crotch .
lisa simpson|it's so nice having everything back to normal .
lisa simpson|grampa's a vampire ?
lisa simpson|but , no , we killed mr burns .
lisa simpson|you're the head vampire ?
lisa simpson|mom ?
lisa simpson|happy halloween , everybody !
lisa simpson|have a blast , mom !
lisa simpson|sure dad .
lisa simpson|hey , dad , i think state and federal laws require us to have a babysitter .
lisa simpson|mr hutz , why are you burning all your personal papers ?
lisa simpson|don't worry , mr hutz is still here to take care of us .
lisa simpson|i always knew some day mom would violently rise up , and cast off the shackles of our male oppressors .
lisa simpson|quit it , bart .
lisa simpson|quit it .
lisa simpson|quit it .
lisa simpson|quit it .
lisa simpson|mom , bart's making faces .
lisa simpson|what is it ?
lisa simpson|dad , this one gesture almost makes up for years of shaky fathering .
lisa simpson|i'm going to have my wedding here .
lisa simpson|um ^
lisa simpson|uh , well ^
lisa simpson|uh ^
lisa simpson|are you mad ?
lisa simpson|we know , dad .
lisa simpson|what !
lisa simpson|this is madness .
lisa simpson|he's just peddling a bunch of easy answers .
lisa simpson|is that why you're sitting on an ice cream sandwich ?
lisa simpson|it's simple , bart .
lisa simpson|you've defined yourself as a rebel .
lisa simpson|and in the absence of a repressive milieu , your societal niche has been coopted .
lisa simpson|ever since that selfhelp guy came to town , you've lost your identity .
lisa simpson|you've fallen through the cracks of our quickfix , onehourphoto , instantoatmeal society .
lisa simpson|well , this is your chance to develop a new and better identity .
lisa simpson|may i suggest goodnatured doormat ?
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|selfimprovement can be achieved , but not with a quickfix .
lisa simpson|it's a long , arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery .
lisa simpson|dad , sit down .
lisa simpson|tsk , tsk .
lisa simpson|the remorse of the sugar junkie .
lisa simpson|really ?
lisa simpson|not even this ?
lisa simpson|the few , the proud , the geeky .
lisa simpson|oh , bart , cartoons don't have to be one hundred percent realistic .
lisa simpson|dad , look , i made fish sticks .
lisa simpson|they're burned on the outside , but they're frozen on the inside so it balances out .
lisa simpson|dad , why are you singing ?
lisa simpson|are you hiding something from me ?
lisa simpson|judging from your song , you're infatuated with a woman named mindy ^
lisa simpson|or a man named andy .
lisa simpson|dad , i'm not gonna fall for that .
lisa simpson|huh ?
lisa simpson|dad , you shouldn't wear glasses that weren't prescribed for you .
lisa simpson|gimme those .
lisa simpson|excuse me , mr mayor .
lisa simpson|this piggy bank contains fifteen dollars i've saved from my allowance .
lisa simpson|it isn't much , but i would like to help .
lisa simpson|mom , we're having a geography pageant at school , and i don't know which state to go as .
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|nevada makes my butt look big .
lisa simpson|dad , what do you think ?
lisa simpson|do you get the feeling this family is disintegrating ?
lisa simpson|i mean we haven't had a meal with mom all week .
lisa simpson|and she hasn't even started my costume for the geography pageant .
lisa simpson|there's nothing to eat for breakfast .
lisa simpson|maybe mom just doesn't realize we miss her .
lisa simpson|we could go down to the casino and let her know .
lisa simpson|mommm !
lisa simpson|i just had a bad dream .
lisa simpson|well , i know it's absurd , but i dreamed the boogeyman was after me and he's hiding ^
lisa simpson|does this mean you'll help me with my costume ?
lisa simpson|thanks , mom .
lisa simpson|dad , mom said she'd be home to help me with my costume , and she's not and the geography pageant is tonight .
lisa simpson|but dad , if i don't show up in a rubber suit shaped like the state of florida , i'll be the laughing stock of the whole school .
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|i'm not a state , i'm a monster !
lisa simpson|wake up , dad !
lisa simpson|wake up !
lisa simpson|there was a burglar and he took my saxophone .
lisa simpson|you had a stamp collection ?
lisa simpson|bart's pain is funny , but mine isn't .
lisa simpson|that saxophone was my one creative outlet .
lisa simpson|it was the only way i could truly express myself .
lisa simpson|we are insured , aren't we , mom ?
lisa simpson|what's the point of all these precautions ?
lisa simpson|i've already lost the only thing that matters to me .
lisa simpson|what , this jug ?
lisa simpson|thank you .
lisa simpson|dad , don't you see you're abusing your power like all vigilantes ?
lisa simpson|i mean , if you're the police , who will police the police ?
lisa simpson|and i still don't have my saxophone .
lisa simpson|world domination ?
lisa simpson|dad , maybe this will cheer you up .
lisa simpson|oh , grampa .
lisa simpson|they pelted you too ?
lisa simpson|what ?
lisa simpson|who ?
lisa simpson|huh ?
lisa simpson|what ?
lisa simpson|wow !
lisa simpson|how'd you track him down , grampa ?
lisa simpson|thank you .
lisa simpson|and thank you , dad .
lisa simpson|you got it back , just like you said you would .
lisa simpson|why are you so happy ?
lisa simpson|you're right , bart .
lisa simpson|school is for losers .
lisa simpson|and that's how i cured all disease , ended war , and reunited the entire cast of tv's facts of life , including long time holdout , tootie .
lisa simpson|hush , field trip boy .
lisa simpson|impaled on my nobel peace prize .
lisa simpson|how ironic .
lisa simpson|why ?
lisa simpson|i'm so much happier here .
lisa simpson|i've got a weekend job helping the poor .
lisa simpson|and i'm only eight .
lisa simpson|this biography of bart came out awfully quickly .
lisa simpson|it's not even about him .
lisa simpson|but inside it's mostly about ross perot .
lisa simpson|and the last two chapters are excerpts from the oliver north trial .
lisa simpson|like what ?
lisa simpson|forget it , dad .
lisa simpson|if i ever become famous , i want it to be for something worthwhile , not because of some obnoxious fad .
lisa simpson|and now you can go back to just being you , instead of a onedimensional character with a silly catchphrase .
lisa simpson|if anyone wants me i'll be in my room .
lisa simpson|dad , you should blow the whistle on the kwikemart .
lisa simpson|dad , are you listening to me ?
lisa simpson|i can see through time .
lisa simpson|mmm corn .
lisa simpson|haven't had that in awhile .
lisa simpson|bye !
lisa simpson|and he taught me how to play the shenai .
lisa simpson|i think what my father's saying is you're like a member of the family now .
lisa simpson|they made dad sickymart .
lisa simpson|isn't there anything you can do to get your job back ?
lisa simpson|dad ^
lisa simpson|that's over ten thousand miles away .
lisa simpson|that's over sixteen thousand kilometers .
lisa simpson|dad , dad !
lisa simpson|what'd ya bring ?
lisa simpson|what'd ya bring ?
lisa simpson|i'm sorry , apu .
lisa simpson|awww .
lisa simpson|awww .
lisa simpson|thanks .
lisa simpson|mr simpson .
lisa simpson|stop .
lisa simpson|your constant letters are becoming a nuisance .
lisa simpson|stop .
lisa simpson|if you do not cease , i will be forced to pursue legal action .
lisa simpson|stop .
lisa simpson|signed , boris karloff , hollywood , california .
lisa simpson|i'm warning you , mom i may get a little crazy .
lisa simpson|hey , horseface !
lisa simpson|git yer ugly piehooks off that summer fun set !
lisa simpson|thanks for buying us these toys , grampa .
lisa simpson|a hush falls over the general assembly as stacy approaches the podium to deliver what will no doubt be a stirring and memorable address .
lisa simpson|come on , stacy .
lisa simpson|i've waited my whole life to hear you speak .
lisa simpson|don't you have anything relevant to say ?
lisa simpson|it's not funny , bart !
lisa simpson|millions of girls will grow up thinking that this is the right way to act !
lisa simpson|that they can never be anything more than vacuous ninnies whose only goal is to look pretty , land a rich husband , and spend all day on the phone with their equally vacuous friends talking about how damn terrific it is to look pretty and have a rich husband !
lisa simpson|don't you people see anything wrong with what malibu stacy says ?
lisa simpson|no , celeste , i mean the things she says are sexist .
lisa simpson|they cannot keep making dolls like this !
lisa simpson|something has to be done !
lisa simpson|i can't believe you're just gonna stand by as your daughters grow up in a world where this , this is their role model .
lisa simpson|that's it !
lisa simpson|i'm calling the company !
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|we could go on the factory tour and i could complain in person !
lisa simpson|i have one .
lisa simpson|is the remarkably sexist drivel spouted by malibu stacy intentional , or is it just a horrible mistake ?
lisa simpson|it's awful being a kid .
lisa simpson|no one listens to you .
lisa simpson|action !
lisa simpson|you're getting a job .
lisa simpson|i thought you might be able to help me get in touch with the inventor of malibu stacy .
lisa simpson|thanks .
lisa simpson|no , it couldn't be ^
lisa simpson|excuse me .
lisa simpson|miss lovell ?
lisa simpson|i'd like to talk to you about malibu stacy .
lisa simpson|am i the first ?
lisa simpson|i want you to hear what malibu stacy is telling a generation of little girls .
lisa simpson|change what she says .
lisa simpson|it's your company .
lisa simpson|that's awful !
lisa simpson|but you are malibu stacy , and as long as she has your name , you have a responsibility .
lisa simpson|i'd be mortified if someone ever made a lousy product with the simpson name on it .
lisa simpson|but if you can learn from malibu stacy's mistakes , so can everyone .
lisa simpson|i'm sure we can think of something together .
lisa simpson|c'mon !
lisa simpson|no you're not !
lisa simpson|uh , i'll come back tomorrow .
lisa simpson|i've got the solution you and i are gonna make our own talking doll .
lisa simpson|she'll have the wisdom of gertrude stein and the wit of cathy guisewite , the tenacity of nina totenberg and the common sense of elizabeth cady stanton .
lisa simpson|and to top it off , the downtoearth good looks of eleanor roosevelt !
lisa simpson|make sure you get my mom's hair just right .
lisa simpson|how about me ?
lisa simpson|when i get married , i'm keeping my own name .
lisa simpson|you know , that should probably be if i choose to get married .
lisa simpson|all right !
lisa simpson|now all we need is a name .
lisa simpson|how about minerva , after the roman goddess of wisdom ?
lisa simpson|this is great !
lisa simpson|they're really gonna sell our doll .
lisa simpson|really ?
lisa simpson|dad , did you hear something ?
lisa simpson|wait !
lisa simpson|don't be fooled !
lisa simpson|she's just a regular malibu stacy with a stupid cheap hat !
lisa simpson|she still embodies all the awful stereotypes she did before .
lisa simpson|well , i guess you can't beat big business .
lisa simpson|there's just no room for the little guy .
lisa simpson|you know , if we get through to just that one little girl , it'll all be worth it .
lisa simpson|what ?
lisa simpson|how doth the hero , strong and brave , a celestial path in the heavens pave !
lisa simpson|go , dad , go .
lisa simpson|what are you basing that on , mom ?
lisa simpson|come on , dad , you can make it .
lisa simpson|yeah , dad .
lisa simpson|how many people have seen the ice caps and the deserts all at once , or the majesty of the northern lights from one hundred miles above ?
lisa simpson|what's so special about this game anyway ?
lisa simpson|it's just another chapter in the pointless rivalry between springfield and shelbyville .
lisa simpson|they built a mini mall so we built a bigger mini mall .
lisa simpson|they made the world's largest pizza so we burnt down their city hall .
lisa simpson|dad and ned flanders friends ?
lisa simpson|what's next ^
lisa simpson|a's on bart's report card ?
lisa simpson|don't worry , bart .
lisa simpson|it seems like every week something odd happens to the simpsons .
lisa simpson|my advice is to ride it out , make an occasional smartalec quip and by next week we'll be back to where we started from , ready for another wacky adventure .
lisa simpson|that's the spirit .
lisa simpson|we got the recipe from the fruit punch advisory board .
lisa simpson|yeah .
lisa simpson|maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures .
lisa simpson|hi , mom .
lisa simpson|and i'm going to the park to jam with the little white girls blues quartet .
lisa simpson|wanna come with me , daddyo ?
lisa simpson|me too .
lisa simpson|they're having a great time and i'm stuck in here .
lisa simpson|we won't .
lisa simpson|you all seem to be forgetting the most important thing .
lisa simpson|which is that it's wrong to imprison an animal .
lisa simpson|he's hungry .
lisa simpson|here you go , stampy .
lisa simpson|eat it slow .
lisa simpson|it has to last for ^
lisa simpson|you ate it too fast .
lisa simpson|you can't do that , dad .
lisa simpson|it's cruel .
lisa simpson|he can't just eat peanuts , dad .
lisa simpson|he needs plants to live .
lisa simpson|no , dad .
lisa simpson|he's grooming him .
lisa simpson|taught stampy any tricks yet , bart ?
lisa simpson|i think they're trying to get some attention .
lisa simpson|yeah well , you'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of your natural habitat and gawked at by a bunch of slackjawed yokels .
lisa simpson|it's perfect , dad .
lisa simpson|dad , i think he's an ivory dealer .
lisa simpson|his boots are ivory , his hat is ivory , and i'm pretty sure that check is ivory .
lisa simpson|mr blackheart ?
lisa simpson|are you an ivory dealer ?
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|bart and stampy are gone !
lisa simpson|i'll bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer , dad .
lisa simpson|a deer !
lisa simpson|dad , how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer ?
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|you're sinking !
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|dad , feline means cat .
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|ow !
lisa simpson|my hair !
lisa simpson|i propose to you that your heir need not be a boy .
lisa simpson|in this phallocentric society of ours ^
lisa simpson|dad , mr burns hasn't passed away yet .
lisa simpson|it couldn't possibly be bottomless .
lisa simpson|hey mom , bart's throwing peas .
lisa simpson|ow !
lisa simpson|that was a big one .
lisa simpson|just trying to fill the void of random , meaningless destruction that bart's absence has left in our hearts .
lisa simpson|yeah , me too .
lisa simpson|that midget taught me a lot about his native estonia .
lisa simpson|just take one of my geodes .
lisa simpson|the rocks on my desk .
lisa simpson|no , that's a trilobite ^
lisa simpson|that's petrified wood ^
lisa simpson|muffin .
lisa simpson|that's guilt .
lisa simpson|you feel guilty because your stunt wound up costing a man his job .
lisa simpson|wow , i never thought principal skinner could become any more of a square , but there's the proof .
lisa simpson|i think you need skinner , bart .
lisa simpson|everybody needs a nemesis .
lisa simpson|sherlock holmes had his dr moriarty .
lisa simpson|mountain dew has its melloyello .
lisa simpson|even maggie has that baby with the one eyebrow .
lisa simpson|they're not imprisoning us , bart .
lisa simpson|they're ^
lisa simpson|otto !
lisa simpson|you started off as the bad cop .
lisa simpson|but now you're the good one .
lisa simpson|you and willie got mixed up about ten minutes ago .
lisa simpson|now you're the good cop .
lisa simpson|how do you know ?
lisa simpson|there weren't any witnesses .
lisa simpson|you'd think someone would have seen something at a crowded party like that .
lisa simpson|you're a witness ?
lisa simpson|bart , you have to tell the police .
lisa simpson|why ?
lisa simpson|oh , i see .
lisa simpson|if you testify , skinner will know you skipped school .
lisa simpson|well , if freddy quimby didn't do it , i'm sure he'll be found innocent by a fair and impartial jury .
lisa simpson|i knew it was a bad idea to watch him open the mail .
lisa simpson|only because mayor quimby's buying his nephew's freedom .
lisa simpson|well bart , because of you , a horrible , yet innocent person is going to jail .
lisa simpson|chicks on the bench ^
lisa simpson|so bart , have your insides been gnawed away by guilt , yet ?
lisa simpson|maggie , can you point to the credenza ?
lisa simpson|we didn't invite the other babies .
lisa simpson|maggie doesn't seem to get along with the other babies .
lisa simpson|hot dogs / armour hot dogs ^
lisa simpson|what kinds of kids eat armour hot dogs ?
lisa simpson|skinny kids ^
lisa simpson|tough kids ^
lisa simpson|doesn't this family know any songs that aren't commercials ?
lisa simpson|oh .
lisa simpson|that is so cool , that is so exciting , that is so ^
lisa simpson|crappy .
lisa simpson|it looks like part of scratchy's arm .
lisa simpson|yeesh .
lisa simpson|how much was it ?
lisa simpson|oooh .
lisa simpson|where's grampa ?
lisa simpson|wasn't he invited ?
lisa simpson|sneh .
lisa simpson|i think it's great you're a teacher , dad .
lisa simpson|so , will you be lecturing from a standardized text or using the more socratic method of interactive class participation ?
lisa simpson|i find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst nightmares .
lisa simpson|me too .
lisa simpson|i'll tell you a secret , bart .
lisa simpson|every time i'm worried about mom and dad , i go to the attic and add to my ball of string .
lisa simpson|here , dad .
lisa simpson|i brought you some nice ^
lisa simpson|dad , that's just a plant .
lisa simpson|look , i brought you some nice pudding .
lisa simpson|dad , you can't trick somebody into loving you .
lisa simpson|there's a reason two people come together and stay together .
lisa simpson|there's something they give each other that nobody else can give them .
lisa simpson|if you want to get mom back , you just have to remember what you give her that nobody else can .
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|good luck , dad .
lisa simpson|i'm really glad you're back , dad .
lisa simpson|i knew you could do it .
lisa simpson|now don't screw it up .
lisa simpson|ah , face it , bart .
lisa simpson|our salvation isn't just gonna roll by on the back of some stupid truck .
lisa simpson|pool mobile ?
lisa simpson|time's up ?
lisa simpson|dad ^
lisa simpson|dad ^
lisa simpson|dad ^
lisa simpson|dad , as you know , we've been swimming .
lisa simpson|and we've developed a taste for it .
lisa simpson|we both agree that getting our own pool is the only way to go .
lisa simpson|now before you respond , you must understand that your refusal would result in months and months of ^
lisa simpson|canwehaveapooldad ?
lisa simpson|canwehaveapooldad ?
lisa simpson|canwehaveapooldad ?
lisa simpson|canwehaveapooldad ?
lisa simpson|canwehaveapooldad ?
lisa simpson|canwe ^
lisa simpson|etc .
lisa simpson|yes , dad .
lisa simpson|oh , look .
lisa simpson|bart's all alone .

lisa simpson|coming !
lisa simpson|dad ^
lisa simpson|you have to put chlorine in the water every day , to keep it clean .

lisa simpson|bart , i'm really sorry i've been ignoring you lately .
lisa simpson|i got carried away with being popular .
lisa simpson|but now that i'm unpopular again , i want you to know i'm here for you .
lisa simpson|bart , i'm here for you but , i'm not gonna break into somebody's house .

lisa simpson|mom , i'm auditioning for first chair in the school band and i've got to practice !
lisa simpson|fine .

lisa simpson|ooh !

lisa simpson|i never made miss hoover yowwee .
lisa simpson|hi , allison ?
lisa simpson|i'm lisa simpson .
lisa simpson|oh , it's great to finally meet someone who converses above the normal eightyearoldlevel .

lisa simpson|mom .
lisa simpson|why am i still rotting away in the second grade instead of being skipped ahead ?
lisa simpson|well , did you ever talk to anyone at the school ?
lisa simpson|make a few calls on my behalf ?
lisa simpson|maybe you could've been nicer to principal skinner , if you know what i mean .
lisa simpson|it hurts my teeth .
lisa simpson|and it doesn't have nails and broken glass in it ^
lisa simpson|i won first chair ?
lisa simpson|what's happening ^
lisa simpson|oh ^
lisa simpson|it was just a dream .
lisa simpson|i won first chair ?
lisa simpson|i need help , mom .
lisa simpson|there's another girl at school who's smarter , younger , and a better sax player than me .
lisa simpson|oh i feel so average .
lisa simpson|but she's better than me at everything that makes me special .
lisa simpson|you're thinking of bears , mom .
lisa simpson|i can't tell you either , ralph .
lisa simpson|ah , that used to be my face in the mud ^
lisa simpson|i appreciate the offer , but it goes against every moral fiber in my body .
lisa simpson|i don't need a card .
lisa simpson|you live in the room next to me .
lisa simpson|hey , i am above average !
lisa simpson|so what if allison's ahead of me ?
lisa simpson|there's no shame in being second .
lisa simpson|why would they come to our concert just to boo us ?
lisa simpson|give it to me !
lisa simpson|hey wait , there's nothing bad here .
lisa simpson|i've got to stop being so petty .
lisa simpson|i should be allison's friend , not her competitor .
lisa simpson|i mean , she is a wonderful person .
lisa simpson|i prefer my phrasing .
lisa simpson|you're a wonderful person .
lisa simpson|oh really ?
lisa simpson|i ^
lisa simpson|jeremy's iron .
lisa simpson|what's this ?
lisa simpson|you're finished already ?
lisa simpson|but the competition isn't for weeks .
lisa simpson|it's great .
lisa simpson|it's really great .
lisa simpson|look , bart .
lisa simpson|it almost killed me , but i handcrafted all seventyfive characters from oliver twist .
lisa simpson|and now the coup de grace a bitter snowstorm .
lisa simpson|is it okay ?
lisa simpson|oh who am i kidding ?
lisa simpson|there's no way i'm ever gonna beat allison !
lisa simpson|i'll do whatever it takes .
lisa simpson|relatively ?
lisa simpson|bart , her being wet won't help me win the competition .
lisa simpson|perfect !
lisa simpson|enough with the hose !
lisa simpson|it's the beating of that hideous heart !
lisa simpson|i mean , i think i hear something .
lisa simpson|why , here's allison's real diorama .
lisa simpson|it got misplaced , ^
lisa simpson|or so it would seem .
lisa simpson|after the way i've behaved , i don't deserve to win .
lisa simpson|what ?
lisa simpson|i'm really sorry about what i did , allison .
lisa simpson|it's no shame being second to you .
lisa simpson|only if we're the best .
lisa simpson|hey , ralph .
lisa simpson|want to come with me and allison to play anagrams ?
lisa simpson|not exactly .
lisa simpson|they pieced it together from old shows , and it seems new to the trusting eyes of impressionable youth .
lisa simpson|ren and stimpy do it all the time .
lisa simpson|mom , romance is dead .
lisa simpson|it was acquired in a hostile takeover by hallmark and disney .
lisa simpson|homogenized , then sold off piece by piece .
lisa simpson|happy valentine's .
lisa simpson|yes , i do .
lisa simpson|and just like your love stories , it's tragic and filled with hurt feelings and scars that will never heal .
lisa simpson|it started appropriately enough with an innocent boy being embarrassed on valentine's day ^
lisa simpson|poor ralph .
lisa simpson|here you go , ralph .
lisa simpson|it was an unusually warm february 14th , so the children walked home without jackets .
lisa simpson|sure , i guess .
lisa simpson|glad you liked it .
lisa simpson|yeah .
lisa simpson|nice gag .
lisa simpson|well , here's my house .
lisa simpson|oh , no .
lisa simpson|it's a package from ralph .
lisa simpson|oh , a malibu stacy convertible !
lisa simpson|look in the tunk .
lisa simpson|he must mean trunk .
lisa simpson|tickets to the krusty anniversary show !
lisa simpson|no , thanks .
lisa simpson|aw .
lisa simpson|oh no .
lisa simpson|please don't show me with ralph .
lisa simpson|noooo !
lisa simpson|now you listen to me i don't like you .
lisa simpson|i never liked you , and the only reason i gave you that stupid valentine is 'cause nobody else would !
lisa simpson|mom , doesn't any love story have a happy ending ?
lisa simpson|that didn't seem like a happy ending .
lisa simpson|that seems more like a detached tale of modern alienation .
lisa simpson|sorry , mom .
lisa simpson|i've decided to save my love for someone who is guaranteed not to reject me .
lisa simpson|soon , corey , soon .
lisa simpson|ah , your first kiss .
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|remember how you said that going to itchy and scratchy land would be too damned expensive ?
lisa simpson|can we ?
lisa simpson|yayyyyyy !
lisa simpson|yayyy !
lisa simpson|we're going to itchy and scratchy land !
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|bart's dead !
lisa simpson|you know , itchy and scratchy land isn't just for kids .
lisa simpson|they have a place called parents island .
lisa simpson|yeah .
lisa simpson|dancing , bowling , fashionable shops , over one hundred bars and saloons , and a world class chemical dependency center .
lisa simpson|yayyyy !
lisa simpson|okay , byebye / bye / bye , grampa .
lisa simpson|haven't we stood in five different states long enough ?
lisa simpson|cool !
lisa simpson|/ neato !
lisa simpson|ow !
lisa simpson|mom , that's veal .
lisa simpson|awww , look at that cute little baby axe .
lisa simpson|who are all these characters ?
lisa simpson|oh yeah .
lisa simpson|they weren't very funny .
lisa simpson|i wonder if this kind of violence really does desensitize us ?
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|don't do it , bart .
lisa simpson|dad , i think you're wrong about that robot trying to be your friend .
lisa simpson|dad , the flash must have scrambled their circuits .
lisa simpson|just keep taking pictures .
lisa simpson|yeah , best ever .
lisa simpson|but mom , it's exactly what you wanted in a vacation .
lisa simpson|it brought us together as a family , we got a lot of good exercise outdoors , and we have so many memories .
lisa simpson|no , mom .
lisa simpson|he's right .
lisa simpson|observe .
lisa simpson|i don't like him either mom , but i'm doing a report on local politics for my school project .
lisa simpson|dad , i had to listen to this jerk all morning .
lisa simpson|can we listen to something else ?
lisa simpson|that sounds like sideshow bob !
lisa simpson|dad , i'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't know who sideshow bob is .
lisa simpson|sideshow bob used to be krusty the clown's sidekick .
lisa simpson|but in 1990 , he framed krusty for armed robbery and bart got him put in jail .
lisa simpson|when he got out , he married aunt selma and tried to murder her .
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|your mortal enemy is on the radio !
lisa simpson|i meant your other mortal enemy , sideshow bob .
lisa simpson|uncle mayor was just saying that us kids are the most important natural resource we have !
lisa simpson|this time , he's the lesser of two evils .
lisa simpson|i hope that flu doesn't affect his performance out there .
lisa simpson|there's no councilman les wynan .
lisa simpson|i don't think bob won that election legally .
lisa simpson|i can't believe a convicted felon would get so many votes and another convicted felon would get so few .
lisa simpson|i thought this was a secret ballot .
lisa simpson|okay , aaron a .
lisa simpson|aaronson voted for ^
lisa simpson|bob .
lisa simpson|aaron l .
lisa simpson|aaronson voted for ^
lisa simpson|bob .
lisa simpson|arthur b .
lisa simpson|ablabab voted for ^
lisa simpson|bob .
lisa simpson|hey !
lisa simpson|this is so cool , bart .
lisa simpson|we're just like woodward and bernstein !
lisa simpson|no edgar neubauer .
lisa simpson|this is hopeless .
lisa simpson|they're gonna demolish our house for sure .
lisa simpson|we're gonna have to move into a motel 6 .
lisa simpson|no , bart , don't you see ?
lisa simpson|dead people can't vote !
lisa simpson|look !
lisa simpson|prudence goodwyfe , died 1641 .
lisa simpson|she voted for bob , too !
lisa simpson|so did buddy holly , richie valens , and the big bopper !
lisa simpson|even the pet cemetery voted for bob !
lisa simpson|look !
lisa simpson|mr and mrs bananas !
lisa simpson|humphrey boagart !
lisa simpson|oh , my poor dead kitty !
lisa simpson|please , not you too !
lisa simpson|all right , bob !
lisa simpson|now it's personal !
lisa simpson|i have a plan .
lisa simpson|i think we can trap him .
lisa simpson|you know , sideshow bob , i believe you when you say you're innocent ^
lisa simpson|because we all know you're a naive pawn , puppet , if you will , of the most diabolical political genius springfield has ever known birchibald t .
lisa simpson|barlow !
lisa simpson|you don't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself , do you ?
lisa simpson|you were ronnie to his nancy !
lisa simpson|ringo to his rest of the beatles !
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|we did it !
lisa simpson|now we get to keep our house , and you get to go back to fourth grade !
lisa simpson|the spoon , bart .
lisa simpson|oh no !
lisa simpson|we left grampa back at the gas station .
lisa simpson|what about grampa ?
lisa simpson|hello .
lisa simpson|we're here .
lisa simpson|hi .
lisa simpson|etc .
lisa simpson|mom , is dad gonna kill us ?
lisa simpson|dad , look !
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|your hand is jammed in the toaster !
lisa simpson|okilly dokilly .
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|are we taking the new lexus to aunt patty and selma's funeral today ?
lisa simpson|bart , does it strike you as odd that uter disappeared and suddenly they're serving us this mysterious food called uterbräten ?
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|you've gotta help !
lisa simpson|they're cooking kids in the school cafeteria !
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|remember bart , i mean , dances in underwear , we take the white man alive .
lisa simpson|don't be so hard on yourself , bart .
lisa simpson|it's not your fault jessica doesn't like you .
lisa simpson|no , bart .
lisa simpson|i just think you and jessica are too different from each other to get along .
lisa simpson|she's a sweet , kind reverend's daughter and you're the devil's cabana boy .
lisa simpson|i can't believe it , bart .
lisa simpson|i'd always thought jessica was so sweet .
lisa simpson|you gotta give her up .
lisa simpson|bart , it's naive to think you can change a person .
lisa simpson|except maybe that boy who works in the library .
lisa simpson|well read and just a little wild .
lisa simpson|if only someone could tame him .
lisa simpson|bart , be strong .
lisa simpson|you don't need that little hell cat .
lisa simpson|so here's where you're hiding .
lisa simpson|bart , we can't just let her get away with this .
lisa simpson|yeah , well i eat fruit loops for breakfast .
lisa simpson|i know most of you have already judged my brother guilty without any proof .
lisa simpson|but doesn't the bible teach us judge not lest ye be judged , reverend ?
lisa simpson|there is someone among us with a guilty conscience .
lisa simpson|after much soul searching i decided it would be wrong of me to name names , but i urge that guilty person here , under the eyes of god , to come forward to confess and save yourself from the torment of your own personal hell .
lisa simpson|i am talking to the collection money thief .
lisa simpson|only you can come forward and end this injustice .
lisa simpson|oh , what the heck , it was jessica lovejoy .
lisa simpson|if you search her room , i am certain you will find the money .
lisa simpson|that doesn't mean you don't have to do your book report .
lisa simpson|what if the weatherman is wrong ?
lisa simpson|snowball fight !
lisa simpson|i made the snowball from the frost in our freezer .
lisa simpson|grades are all i have .
lisa simpson|what could i be failing ?
lisa simpson|i'm smart and a teacher's pet .
lisa simpson|gym ?
lisa simpson|that's the stupidest thing i ever heard .
lisa simpson|that's not fair ^
lisa simpson|why is bart getting a present and i'm getting chewed out ?
lisa simpson|you mean those leagues where parents push their kids into vicious competition to compensate for their own failed dreams of glory ?
lisa simpson|mom , this is really scary .
lisa simpson|i'm gonna get my first 'f' ever .
lisa simpson|ooooh .
lisa simpson|wow bart , i'm so impressed you were able to give milhouse a concussion .
lisa simpson|cut it out , bart !
lisa simpson|i have to join the team , or i'll get an f that will haunt me for the rest of my life .
lisa simpson|he said it was just a name .
lisa simpson|please , dad , i'll be fine .
lisa simpson|you really think i did okay out there , mom ?
lisa simpson|that's very nice , dad , but it's wrong for you to reward violent , competitive behavior .
lisa simpson|however , i will sit up front with you if it's a fatherly gesture of love .
lisa simpson|lay off , guys .
lisa simpson|he's with me .
lisa simpson|don't worry , bart , they won't bother you anymore .
lisa simpson|hey milhouse , knock him down if he's in your way !
lisa simpson|jimbo !

lisa simpson|bart , that was your cherished childhood toy .
lisa simpson|bart , just get out of here .
lisa simpson|that doesn't make sense .
lisa simpson|get out !
lisa simpson|get out !
lisa simpson|okay .
lisa simpson|then i'm going to start kicking air like this .
lisa simpson|and if any part of you should fill that air , it's your own fault .
lisa simpson|bart started it .
lisa simpson|you'll have to do better than that tonight , chump .
lisa simpson|don't worry , i'm wearing my lucky rabbit's head .

lisa simpson|why are you guys jumping to such ridiculous conclusions ?
lisa simpson|haven't you heard of occam's razor ?
lisa simpson|the simplest explanation is probably the correct one .

lisa simpson|he'll be mean to them !
lisa simpson|let's go find your babies !
lisa simpson|who knows what horrible things he's doing to those innocent little puppies ?

lisa simpson|well , mr burns , i hope you've realized the folly of killing innocent animals for fashion .
lisa simpson|oh , yeah .
lisa simpson|i didn't think this was for me .
lisa simpson|i've never seen them fight like that , bart .
lisa simpson|i'm worried that all this posturing and saberrattling could lead to a teachers strike .
lisa simpson|oh no .
lisa simpson|strike ?
lisa simpson|horrible news , mom !
lisa simpson|luckily i've prepared for this , so i'm not too worried .
lisa simpson|oh yeah .
lisa simpson|but dad , by striking they're trying to effect a change in management so that they can be happier and more productive .
lisa simpson|i've got some textbooks , but without state approved syllabi and standardized testing my education can only go so far .
lisa simpson|relax ?
lisa simpson|i can't relax .
lisa simpson|nor can i yield , relent , or ^
lisa simpson|only two synonyms ?
lisa simpson|oh my god !
lisa simpson|i'm losing my perspicacity !

lisa simpson|grade me !
lisa simpson|pointless .
lisa simpson|well , my teacher's a nightmare .
lisa simpson|three kids got sick from inhaling his ointment fumes , he confiscated everything made of tin , and then he sent us home early because he got his beard caught in the pencil sharpener .
lisa simpson|there's no way i'll get into an ivy league school now .
lisa simpson|at this rate i probably won't even get into vassar .
lisa simpson|mom , i think he's serious .
lisa simpson|how're you feelin' , big brother ?
lisa simpson|i'm glad you're okay , bart .
lisa simpson|bleeding gums murphy !

lisa simpson|when was the last time you worked ?
lisa simpson|your sax !
lisa simpson|thank you so much !
lisa simpson|wow , you've had some career .
lisa simpson|although the moral seems to be that a lifetime of jazz leaves you sad and lonely .
lisa simpson|i sure am .
lisa simpson|look !
lisa simpson|i stopped brushing my teeth so i can play just like you !
lisa simpson|lift me , won't you lift me / above the old routine / make it nice , play it clean , jazzman ^

lisa simpson|hey , bleeding gums !
lisa simpson|i was great !
lisa simpson|and i owe it all to ^
lisa simpson|what happened to mr murphy ?

lisa simpson|thank you .
lisa simpson|oh dad , why did he have to die ?
lisa simpson|uh huh .
lisa simpson|yeah .

lisa simpson|how come ?
lisa simpson|uh , maybe i need to talk to somebody with a little more age and wisdom .
lisa simpson|grampa !
lisa simpson|it's only maggie .
lisa simpson|that's only the cat .
lisa simpson|that's maggie again , grampa .
lisa simpson|how come it won't stop hurting ?
lisa simpson|isn't anybody gonna show up ?
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|it was bleeding gums murphy .
lisa simpson|saxophone !
lisa simpson|he was a jazz musician .
lisa simpson|you didn't know him !
lisa simpson|nobody knew him !
lisa simpson|but he was a great man !
lisa simpson|and i won't rest until all of springfield knows the name of bleeding gums murphy !
lisa simpson|mom , i want to honor bleeding gums' memory , but i don't know where to start .
lisa simpson|hi , i have a request .
lisa simpson|i would like you to do a tribute to bleeding gums murphy , please .
lisa simpson|what if i could find it ?

lisa simpson|that was for you , bleeding gums .
lisa simpson|i don't want you to go !
lisa simpson|goodbye .

lisa simpson|when the jazzman's testifyin' a faithless man believes / he can sing you into paradise / or bring you to your knees / jazzman , take my blues away ^
lisa simpson|one more time !
lisa simpson|hey mom , is this how you caught him ?
lisa simpson|mom , was catching that guy the most incredibly exciting thing you've ever done ?
lisa simpson|mom , if someone shot at the mayor , would you have to throw yourself in front of him and take the bullet ?
lisa simpson|whatever you do , mom , we'll be proud of you .
lisa simpson|as long as it's constitutional .
lisa simpson|so , mom , what are you gonna do with your day off ?
lisa simpson|mom's police tape isn't a toy , dad .
lisa simpson|mom , i know your intentions are good , but aren't the police a protective force that maintains the status quo for the wealthy elites ?
lisa simpson|don't you think we ought to attack the roots of social problems instead of jamming people into overcrowded prisons ?
lisa simpson|bust 'im , mom !
lisa simpson|/ get 'im , mom !
lisa simpson|/ nail 'im !
lisa simpson|/ you can do it !
lisa simpson|it's been going downhill ever since the lake caught fire .
lisa simpson|i don't even want any .
lisa simpson|i just bought a pity glass ^
lisa simpson|tutoring ?
lisa simpson|the only thing bart's teaching is guerilla combat in shelbyville .
lisa simpson|no , mom !
lisa simpson|bart and some kids ran off to wage war on shelbyville .
lisa simpson|i'd like to start a jazz program for the music department .
lisa simpson|we've got a really great instructor lined up ^
lisa simpson|he's ready to give up the drudgery of the professional mambo circuit and settle into a nice teaching job .
lisa simpson|let's go now , mr puente .
lisa simpson|it is unfeasible to resurrect the dead , bart .
lisa simpson|and even if the three stooges were alive , i doubt they'd want to hang around with you .
lisa simpson|oh , no .
lisa simpson|that's awful , mr puente .
lisa simpson|what ?
lisa simpson|oh .
lisa simpson|he owns the nuclear power plant .
lisa simpson|yeah , i'd like to settle his hash , too .
lisa simpson|dad , how can you work for a man like mr burns ?
lisa simpson|marge , bart , lisa , and maggie .
lisa simpson|dad , this doesn't have your name on it .
lisa simpson|sorry , grampa .
lisa simpson|it's just that , for a second , it looked like dad had melted .
lisa simpson|he robbed the school of music !
lisa simpson|everyone in springfield had a reason to shoot mr burns .
lisa simpson|even us .
lisa simpson|bart , he broke your dog's legs .
lisa simpson|grampa , he destroyed your home .
lisa simpson|and dad , well , you kind of went berserk when he couldn't remember your name .
lisa simpson|yeah , i was just getting to me .
lisa simpson|because of mr burns , they canceled my jazz program , and my friend tito puente got fired .
lisa simpson|but i could never shoot someone .
lisa simpson|could not !
lisa simpson|could not !
lisa simpson|could not !
lisa simpson|could not !
lisa simpson|we don't have an outhouse .
lisa simpson|look at burns' suit .
lisa simpson|yeesh .
lisa simpson|actually , mom , in 95% of cases , it is .
lisa simpson|the rest of the time , it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason .
lisa simpson|well , i don't think anyone in this family is capable of attempted murder .
lisa simpson|nancy drew says that all you need to solve a mystery is an inquisitive temperament and two good friends .
lisa simpson|and i've got an inquisitive temperament !
lisa simpson|maybe i could help solve this !
lisa simpson|mr burns is the richest man in town .
lisa simpson|maybe it was about money .
lisa simpson|hey !
lisa simpson|i said that .
lisa simpson|my name is lisa simpson , and i made a chart of all the suspects in the burns case .
lisa simpson|look .
lisa simpson|mr burns hurt all these people financially nightclub owner moe szyslak .
lisa simpson|his bar was closed because of burns' negligence ;
lisa simpson|liquor connoisseur barney gumble .
lisa simpson|when moe's closed , barney lost his only means of support sucking coins out of the love tester machine .
lisa simpson|dedicated educator principal seymour skinner .
lisa simpson|his school lost millions when burns pirated its oil well ;
lisa simpson|and groundstender groundskeeper willie .
lisa simpson|he lost his job and his dream of owning a fine crystal slop bucket .
lisa simpson|tito puente ?
lisa simpson|well , he did vow revenge .
lisa simpson|but i can't see him doing something illegal he's in show business !
lisa simpson|chief wiggum ^
lisa simpson|don't eat ^
lisa simpson|the clues .
lisa simpson|this suit burns better .
lisa simpson|look .

lisa simpson|they have simpson d .
lisa simpson|n .
lisa simpson|a .
lisa simpson|it could've come from any of us .
lisa simpson|except you , since you're a bouvier .
lisa simpson|okay , mom .
lisa simpson|anyway , my point is , the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems .
lisa simpson|like those fingerprints .
lisa simpson|they could've gotten on the gun some other way .
lisa simpson|are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice cream cones ?
lisa simpson|and we don't even know whose gun that was .
lisa simpson|maybe somebody planted it there to frame dad .
lisa simpson|the scene of the crime !
lisa simpson|there must be something here that can clear dad .
lisa simpson|that's it !
lisa simpson|oh , mr pigeon , i'd kiss you if you weren't swimming with disease .
lisa simpson|so , the d .
lisa simpson|n .
lisa simpson|a .
lisa simpson|was right .
lisa simpson|it must've been ^
lisa simpson|oh , dad !
lisa simpson|stop !
lisa simpson|don't shoot my dad !
lisa simpson|he's innocent .
lisa simpson|he wouldn't hurt a fly !
lisa simpson|then with your last ounce of strength you pointed to w and s .
lisa simpson|or from your point of view , m and s ^
lisa simpson|maggie simpson .
lisa simpson|yeah , that's how fast grampa is shrinking .
lisa simpson|cheer up , bart .
lisa simpson|milhouse is still gonna need a true friend .
lisa simpson|someone to tell him he's great , someone to rub lotion on him , someone to hurl whiskey bottles at when he's feeling low .
lisa simpson|wow , mom .
lisa simpson|you didn't have to go to this much trouble .
lisa simpson|mom , you fuss over us way too much .
lisa simpson|hey , c'mon !
lisa simpson|those are prescription shoes !
lisa simpson|i need them !
lisa simpson|no i don't !
lisa simpson|ow !
lisa simpson|mah tug !
lisa simpson|printhipal thkinner , i need thum shoes .
lisa simpson|i don't know .
lisa simpson|they should be here .
lisa simpson|you don't understand .
lisa simpson|mom and dad take good care of us .
lisa simpson|that was a baby tooth ^
lisa simpson|it was loose ^
lisa simpson|yeah .
lisa simpson|it seems like our house , but everything's got a creepy pat booneish quality to it .
lisa simpson|well , when was the last time dad gave her that kind of attention ?
lisa simpson|i thought i could ride this thing out , but everything's just too weird here .
lisa simpson|and they read newsweek instead of nothing .
lisa simpson|yeah .
lisa simpson|the sun is still out .
lisa simpson|you know , maggie hasn't been a simpson as long as us .
lisa simpson|i think she's beginning to forget mom and dad .
lisa simpson|or the way dad used to call the radio station with fake traffic tips ?
lisa simpson|they're ten feet away and we can't even talk to them .
lisa simpson|i wish i could tell them how much i miss them .
lisa simpson|yay !
lisa simpson|we give up .
lisa simpson|uh , actually , the ^
lisa simpson|we were never baptized .
lisa simpson|you're gonna be bart flanders .
lisa simpson|let's see .

lisa simpson|dirt ^
lisa simpson|well , there wasn't really much dirt .
lisa simpson|oh boy !
lisa simpson|really ?
lisa simpson|nooooo !
lisa simpson|it's dripping funnysmelling water all over me !
lisa simpson|where'd you get five bucks ?
lisa simpson|i want five bucks .
lisa simpson|what ?
lisa simpson|how could you do that ?
lisa simpson|your soul is the most valuable part of you !
lisa simpson|well , whether or not the soul is physically real , bart , it's the symbol of everything fine inside us .
lisa simpson|bart , your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever .
lisa simpson|for five dollars , milhouse could own you for a zillion years .
lisa simpson|hmmm ^
lisa simpson|pablo neruda said laughter is the language of the soul .
lisa simpson|i think we should do a test .
lisa simpson|well ?
lisa simpson|that's creepy , bart .
lisa simpson|i think you really did lose your soul .
lisa simpson|how're the southwestern pizza fingers ?
lisa simpson|i would like to say grace .
lisa simpson|lord , have mercy on my soul , and mom's soul , and dad's soul , and maggie's soul , and let every soul in christendom ^
lisa simpson|with the change in my piggy bank .
lisa simpson|not in any of the ones you know about .
lisa simpson|happy to do it .
lisa simpson|but you know , bart , some philosophers believe that nobody is born with a soul that you have to earn one through suffering and thought and prayer , like you did last night .
lisa simpson|we're going to storytown village , grampa .
lisa simpson|it's an amusement park for babies .
lisa simpson|awwww .
lisa simpson|awwww .
lisa simpson|awwww .
lisa simpson|oh , you are so cute !
lisa simpson|yes you are !
lisa simpson|you are !
lisa simpson|i just love you .

lisa simpson|what's the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed me ?
lisa simpson|no , i can't !
lisa simpson|i can't eat any of them !
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|dad ^
lisa simpson|those all come from the same animal .
lisa simpson|oh , my family just doesn't understand my newfound vegetarianism .
lisa simpson|compared to them , the public schools are a haven of enlightenment .
lisa simpson|why does it talk like a lamb ?
lisa simpson|ah ^
lisa simpson|miss hoover ?
lisa simpson|i don't think i can dissect an animal .
lisa simpson|i think it's wrong .
lisa simpson|ah , excuse me ?
lisa simpson|isn't there anything here that doesn't have meat in it ?
lisa simpson|well i believe you're required to provide a vegetarian alternative .
lisa simpson|do you remember when you lost your passion for this work ?
lisa simpson|i never realized before , but some itchy and scratchy cartoons send the message that violence against animals is funny .
lisa simpson|come to homer's bbbq .
lisa simpson|the extra b is for byobb .
lisa simpson|dad , can't you have some other kind of party ?
lisa simpson|one where you don't serve meat ?
lisa simpson|mom .
lisa simpson|it's tomato soup served ice cold !
lisa simpson|they can't seriously expect us to swallow that tripe !
lisa simpson|stop it !
lisa simpson|stop it !
lisa simpson|don't you realize you've just been brainwashed by corporate propaganda ?
lisa simpson|wait dad !
lisa simpson|good news , everyone !
lisa simpson|you don't have to eat meat .
lisa simpson|i made enough gazpacho for all !
lisa simpson|it's bad enough they're all eating meat .
lisa simpson|they don't have to rub it in my face .
lisa simpson|oh , then you must think i'm a monster .
lisa simpson|i'm never ever apologizing because i was standing up for a just cause and you were wrong , wrong , wrong !
lisa simpson|now if you'll excuse me , i'm going to my room .
lisa simpson|bart , tell dad i'll only pass the syrup if it won't be used on any meat product .
lisa simpson|why don't you just eat him , dad .
lisa simpson|that's it .
lisa simpson|i can't live in a house with this prehistoric carnivore .
lisa simpson|i am out of here .
lisa simpson|yes .
lisa simpson|i'm gonna marry a carrot .
lisa simpson|the whole world wants me to eat meat .
lisa simpson|i can't fight it anymore .
lisa simpson|there !
lisa simpson|is everybody happy now ?
lisa simpson|tofu ?
lisa simpson|but why , apu ?
lisa simpson|that's cute .

lisa simpson|that's why i ran away from home .
lisa simpson|wow , paul mccartney !
lisa simpson|i read about you in history class .
lisa simpson|but where's your wife , linda ?
lisa simpson|apu , i'm sure the last thing they want to talk about is ^
lisa simpson|ewwww .
lisa simpson|when will all those fools learn that you can be perfectly healthy simply eating vegetables , fruits , grains , and cheese ?
lisa simpson|you don't eat cheese , apu ?
lisa simpson|i guess i have been pretty hard on a lot of people .
lisa simpson|especially my dad .
lisa simpson|thanks , you guys .
lisa simpson|wow , that'd be great !
lisa simpson|hi , dad .
lisa simpson|looking for me ?
lisa simpson|actually dad , this time i was wrong ^
lisa simpson|too .
lisa simpson|while i was gone , i got some really good advice from paul and linda mccartney .
lisa simpson|i still stand by my beliefs , but i can't defend what i did .
lisa simpson|i'm sorry i messed up your barbecue .
lisa simpson|hey , what's that in his footprint ?
lisa simpson|hmmmmm .
lisa simpson|if your advertising agency created all those giant characters , you must know how to stop them .
lisa simpson|like that old woman who couldn't find the beef ?
lisa simpson|but people can't help looking at them .
lisa simpson|they're wrecking the town .
lisa simpson|hey , springfield !
lisa simpson|are you suffering from the heartbreak of monsteritis ?
lisa simpson|then take a tip from mr paul anka ^
lisa simpson|guarantee void in tennessee .
lisa simpson|it worked !
lisa simpson|they're all dead !
lisa simpson|don't make us poke your eyes out , dad .
lisa simpson|oh my god !
lisa simpson|bart , groundskeeper willie was in my nightmare , too !
lisa simpson|but he got me with hedgeclippers !
lisa simpson|mom , dad martin died at school today !
lisa simpson|bart , don't you realize what this means ?
lisa simpson|the next time we fall asleep we could die !
lisa simpson|it's no use , bart .
lisa simpson|we can't stay up forever .
lisa simpson|okay , but promise you won't be grouchy .
lisa simpson|bart , you're in trouble !
lisa simpson|wake up !
lisa simpson|i'm not asleep , i'm just resting my eye uh oh .
lisa simpson|goodbye , bart !
lisa simpson|you saved us , maggie !
lisa simpson|i don't know , bart .
lisa simpson|something tells me willie's still out there , and that he could come back any time in any form and kill us in ways we can't even imagine .
lisa simpson|sorry , dad .
lisa simpson|this is our spot .
lisa simpson|well , we're calling it now .
lisa simpson|um , i would also like to take your coat .
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|well , where's my dad ?
lisa simpson|sorry .
lisa simpson|i must protest .
lisa simpson|you're abusing a program intended to help the unfortunate .
lisa simpson|have you told mom about this ?
lisa simpson|daad !
lisa simpson|obesity is really unhealthy .
lisa simpson|any doctor will tell you that .
lisa simpson|neat !
lisa simpson|mom , were you ever planning to step in and put a stop to this ?
lisa simpson|i like school .
lisa simpson|i would if i could .
lisa simpson|eww !
lisa simpson|moom !
lisa simpson|this whole thing is really creepy .
lisa simpson|are you sure you won't talk to dad ?
lisa simpson|well , maybe you'll have to hurt his feelings .
lisa simpson|the longer he lives like this , the harder it'll be to go back .
lisa simpson|dad ?
lisa simpson|umm ^
lisa simpson|mom just baked a cake .
lisa simpson|dad , what are you doing down there ?
lisa simpson|hey , leave my dad alone .
lisa simpson|just because he's overweight doesn't mean he's bad .
lisa simpson|he's a sweet man and he has real feelings .
lisa simpson|shouldn't you be working ?
lisa simpson|hey , my dad may have gained a little weight , but he's not some kind of foodcrazed maniac .
lisa simpson|i think it's ironic that dad saved the day , while a slimmer man would have fallen to his death .
lisa simpson|hi , everybody .
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|bart ran into a door frame and bit his tongue !
lisa simpson|this is so weird .
lisa simpson|it's like something out of dickens or melrose place .
lisa simpson|oh , i just keep them out to bug bart .
lisa simpson|me , too !
lisa simpson|more like preschool .
lisa simpson|me , too .
lisa simpson|oh , you didn't dumb it down !
lisa simpson|you said rapport !
lisa simpson|there .
lisa simpson|now no one should be able to hear us .
lisa simpson|all right , we don't need the dryer .
lisa simpson|just shut up and listen .
lisa simpson|there's something fishy about grandma .
lisa simpson|whenever we ask her where she's been all this time , she changes the subject .
lisa simpson|and just now when a police car drove by , she ran into the house .
lisa simpson|mona simpson , mona stevens , martha stewart , penelope olsen , muddy mae suggins ^
lisa simpson|these are the calling cards of a con artist .
lisa simpson|all right , then we'll call your husband grampa .
lisa simpson|how did you survive ?
lisa simpson|no , dad , it's a rhetorical question .
lisa simpson|dad , do you even know what rhetorical means ?
lisa simpson|you know , gramma , i used to think maybe i was adopted .
lisa simpson|i couldn't understand how i fit into this family .
lisa simpson|now that i met you , i suddenly make a lot of sense .
lisa simpson|gramma , have you ever thought about moving back to springfield ?
lisa simpson|don't you remember , dad ?
lisa simpson|he framed krusty .
lisa simpson|he tried to kill aunt selma .
lisa simpson|he rigged an election .

lisa simpson|do i understand you correctly , bartron ?
lisa simpson|do you wish me to release you from the helmet of evil thoughts with my enchanted space wand ?
lisa simpson|i will do it , bartron .

lisa simpson|i wanna look at the pets and write things on the typewriters and see if the new dictionaries are in !
lisa simpson|i admit i haven't known mom as long as you have , but i know when she's really upset .
lisa simpson|her heart won't just wipe clean like this bathroom countertop .
lisa simpson|it absorbs everything that touches it , like this bathroom rug .

lisa simpson|just buy it .
lisa simpson|you don't have to rationalize everything .
lisa simpson|do i have to go ?
lisa simpson|that country club is a hotbed of exclusionist snobs and statusseeking socialclimbers .
lisa simpson|the rich are different from you and me .
lisa simpson|i don't know what mom's thinking .
lisa simpson|this whole country club scene is so decadent ^
lisa simpson|all these spoiled brats and their smug , complacent parents .
lisa simpson|it just reinforces ^
lisa simpson|the unspoken class system of ^
lisa simpson|horses sitting on their high ^
lisa simpson|horses i'm sorry .
lisa simpson|i gotta go !
lisa simpson|mom , look !
lisa simpson|i found something more fun than complaining !

lisa simpson|know ye who read this there is more to my life than history records .
lisa simpson|ha ha ha ha ha .
lisa simpson|oh my god !
lisa simpson|our town hero is a fraud !
lisa simpson|i write this confession so that my infamy will live on long after my body has succumbed to my infectious diphtheria .
lisa simpson|oh , it's just the excitement of studying jebediah .
lisa simpson|just when i was getting over my chester a .
lisa simpson|arthritis .
lisa simpson|uh , no .
lisa simpson|what would you say if i told you jebediah springfield wasn't as great as he's cracked up to be ?
lisa simpson|look .
lisa simpson|jebediah was really a vicious pirate named hans sprüngfeld .
lisa simpson|his tongue was bitten off by a turk in a grog house fight !
lisa simpson|he had a prosthetic tongue made out of silver .
lisa simpson|he was one of the evillest men of the 1780's .
lisa simpson|he even tried to kill george washington !
lisa simpson|the next time hans sprüngfeld was seen , he had changed his name to jebediah springfield .
lisa simpson|you do ?
lisa simpson|aw , thanks , dad .
lisa simpson|but it's all true !
lisa simpson|miss hoover thought i made the whole thing up .
lisa simpson|she called me a p .
lisa simpson|c .
lisa simpson|thug .
lisa simpson|that won't help , dad .
lisa simpson|no one's ever going to believe me .
lisa simpson|we could ?
lisa simpson|no baseball bat .
lisa simpson|hi , mr hurlbut .
lisa simpson|that's jebediah's secret confession .
lisa simpson|it proves he was a fraud .
lisa simpson|but it explains why there's no record of jebediah before 1795 !
lisa simpson|he was hans sprüngfeld until then !
lisa simpson|i'm not going to give up .
lisa simpson|i refuse to believe that everyone refuses to believe the truth .
lisa simpson|i'd like 25 copies on goldenrod , 25 on canary , 25 on saffron , and 25 on paella .
lisa simpson|you don't have to help me with this , dad .
lisa simpson|hi , apu .
lisa simpson|can i put this poster in your window ?
lisa simpson|he wouldn't let me put it up .
lisa simpson|jebediah springfield was nothing more than an evil , bloodthirsty pirate who hated this town !
lisa simpson|that's a myth that got mixed up with the truth .
lisa simpson|i hope you know you're sponsoring a celebration for a murderous pirate !
lisa simpson|there is one way get the silver tongue .
lisa simpson|if jebediah's who i say he is , then it should still be in his grave .
lisa simpson|yes .
lisa simpson|don't forget to look in his shoes .
lisa simpson|when i lose something , sometimes it turns up in my shoes .
lisa simpson|i was so sure ^
lisa simpson|oh , dad , i'm really sorry .

lisa simpson|the missing piece of the puzzle ^
lisa simpson|i've got it !
lisa simpson|that's because you stole it !
lisa simpson|but when you found the truth , you couldn't take it !
lisa simpson|you couldn't stand that you'd devoted your life to a fraud !
lisa simpson|so you covered it up !
lisa simpson|didn't you ?
lisa simpson|didn't you ?
lisa simpson|stop it !
lisa simpson|where's the silver tongue ?
lisa simpson|you did .
lisa simpson|until i realized that jebediah's confession was saying more than he meant it to .
lisa simpson|how else could he have gotten this ?
lisa simpson|exactly .
lisa simpson|people of springfield , i , uh , i don't know quite how to say this ^
lisa simpson|i did a lot of research on jebediah springfield and ^
lisa simpson|jebediah springfield was ^
lisa simpson|jebediah was ^
lisa simpson|great .
lisa simpson|i , um , just wanted to say that i've done some research and , uh , he was great .
lisa simpson|because the myth of jebediah has value , too .
lisa simpson|it's brought out the best in everyone in this town .
lisa simpson|regardless of who said it , a noble spirit embiggens the smallest man .
lisa simpson|you know , dad , assisting mr burns could give your career a real shot in the arm .

lisa simpson|mom , there's a weird smell and a lot of cursing coming from the basement .
lisa simpson|and dad's upstairs .

lisa simpson|i don't understand it .

lisa simpson|thanks , dad .
lisa simpson|oh , this has been the best spring break ever !
lisa simpson|so how's the national grammar rodeo , bart ?
lisa simpson|i knew it !
lisa simpson|i knew it because why would they have our national grammar rodeo in another nation ?
lisa simpson|hmm ^
lisa simpson|you could travel for free if you were a stewardess .
lisa simpson|well , how badly do you want to get home ?

lisa simpson|there's something troubling me , dad ^
lisa simpson|but i don't think i can tell you because it's a secret .
lisa simpson|langdon alger ?
lisa simpson|oh , i don't like him anymore ^
lisa simpson|okay , but you've got to promise you won't get mad or tell anyone , especially bart .
lisa simpson|bart rented a car with a phony driver's license and drove milhouse , nelson , and martin to a wig outlet in knoxville and the car got crushed and they're out of money and they can't get home and bart's working as a courier and just came back from hong kong .
lisa simpson|no , no !

lisa simpson|uh , grampa , maybe i should moisten your washcloth ^
lisa simpson|wow , he's even more agitated than usual .
lisa simpson|maybe we should let him stay .
lisa simpson|bart's room .
lisa simpson|that's specious reasoning , dad .
lisa simpson|by your logic , i could claim that this rock keeps tigers away .
lisa simpson|it doesn't work .
lisa simpson|it's just a stupid rock .
lisa simpson|but i don't see any tigers around here , do you ?
lisa simpson|actually , dad , it's the smallest tax increase in history .
lisa simpson|that's the homeowner tax .
lisa simpson|i don't see how you can support proposition 24 , dad .
lisa simpson|but immigration is what america's all about .
lisa simpson|even the simpson family immigrated to america .
lisa simpson|right , grampa ?
lisa simpson|mom , you're the greatest .
lisa simpson|can i have this licorice ?

lisa simpson|only with advertisements everywhere and tons of security guards .
lisa simpson|generation x may be shallow , but at least they have tolerance and respect for all people .
lisa simpson|it smells like otto's jacket .
lisa simpson|wearing a jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your connection to reggae music .
lisa simpson|it may be bleak , but this music is really getting to the crowd .
lisa simpson|dad , are you okay ?

lisa simpson|hardly .
lisa simpson|how am i supposed to get home ?
lisa simpson|i feel so stupid , mom .
lisa simpson|nelson's not right for me at all .
lisa simpson|and i don't think he ever will be .

lisa simpson|mom ^
lisa simpson|oh , i know .
lisa simpson|i wonder if i could change nelson ^

lisa simpson|isn't it nice up here ?
lisa simpson|what are you thinking , nelson ?
lisa simpson|about anything .
lisa simpson|what do you feel ?
lisa simpson|what's inside you right now ?
lisa simpson|come on , nelson !
lisa simpson|you must think and feel things .
lisa simpson|i mean , look where we are a rolling green hillside , the stars coming out like god is lighting a million tiny candles , the moon looking down on us as if to say ^
lisa simpson|see , you do have a tender side .
lisa simpson|you just needed someone to bring it out .
lisa simpson|listen , you thugs , stop making fun of him or you'll be sorry !
lisa simpson|you'll be so sorry when you realize how you've hurt the feelings of a sweet young man !
lisa simpson|he's not like you anymore !
lisa simpson|he's changed !
lisa simpson|and he doesn't want to hang around with a buncha crumbbums !
lisa simpson|you got rid of them !

lisa simpson|i thought you weren't there .
lisa simpson|you lied to me .
lisa simpson|there , you did it again !
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|you don't understand , nelson .
lisa simpson|a kiss doesn't mean anything if it's dishonest .
lisa simpson|i was foolish to think i'd actually changed you .
lisa simpson|maybe i was seeing things in you that weren't really there .
lisa simpson|then why did you want to be with me ?
lisa simpson|well , i guess this is it ^
lisa simpson|let's just call it smell ya later .
lisa simpson|don't worry .

lisa simpson|we better pick up some supplies .
lisa simpson|okay , start with diagonal colors .
lisa simpson|moom , let's just grab what we can and get out of here .

lisa simpson|dad , according to junior skeptic magazine the chances are a hundred seventyfive milliontoone of another form of life actually coming in contact with ours .

lisa simpson|santa's little helper , it's your birthday ?
lisa simpson|we've got to get you a present !
lisa simpson|yes we do !

lisa simpson|we'll find a way .
lisa simpson|mom has made so many sacrifices for us it's time we gave up something for her .

lisa simpson|maestro , if you please .
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|if maggie's fussy , don't avoid her .

lisa simpson|goodbye shary bobbins !
lisa simpson|do you think we'll ever see her again ?
lisa simpson|sure , we love it !
lisa simpson|but how can we watch tv when it's so beautiful out ?
lisa simpson|ok .

lisa simpson|why is that mirror sneezing ?

lisa simpson|me !
lisa simpson|/ i would !
lisa simpson|um , excuse me , sir .
lisa simpson|the thing is , there's not really anything wrong with the itchy and scratchy show it's as good as ever .
lisa simpson|but after so many years , the characters just can't have the same impact they once had .
lisa simpson|adding a new character is often a desperate attempt to boost low ratings .
lisa simpson|you should try out , dad .
lisa simpson|you have a funny voice .
lisa simpson|no , it's not your fault , dad .
lisa simpson|you did fine .
lisa simpson|it's just that poochie was a soulless byproduct of committee thinking .
lisa simpson|you can't be cool just by spouting a bunch of wornout buzzwords .
lisa simpson|yes .
lisa simpson|terrible .
lisa simpson|i guess ^
lisa simpson|we should thank our lucky stars they're still putting out a program of this caliber after so many years .
lisa simpson|aw , mom , are you sure you want to sell a family heirloom to pay the gas bill ?
lisa simpson|i mean , what would your grandma say ?
lisa simpson|wow !
lisa simpson|an actual robot from the movie clank !
lisa simpson|clank !
lisa simpson|you're dead !
lisa simpson|ech !
lisa simpson|think of how awful it would be for the poor midget inside ^
lisa simpson|please don't construe our ownership of this as an endorsement of slavery .
lisa simpson|hic !
lisa simpson|and fluffernutters !
lisa simpson|mom , john likes itchy and scratchy as much as we do maybe more !
lisa simpson|i never realized how many celebrities humiliated themselves right in our own backyard !
lisa simpson|but , dad , it's barbaric !
lisa simpson|how does killing a deer make you more of a man ?
lisa simpson|no .
lisa simpson|they were just going to find a deer and make bart shoot it .
lisa simpson|but if there're no deer out there , then what are they hunting ?
lisa simpson|where are the dice ?
lisa simpson|this is about as tolerant as dad gets , so you should be flattered .
lisa simpson|he thinks you're gay .
lisa simpson|and vice versa .
lisa simpson|hey , you said we were going to dairy queen .
lisa simpson|i know it's hard to accept , bart , but face it sideshow bob has changed .
lisa simpson|bob's trailer at the construction site ?
lisa simpson|what were you thinking ?
lisa simpson|if i didn't know better , i'd swear bob was building a dam .
lisa simpson|bart , there must be millions of dollars there !
lisa simpson|run !
lisa simpson|then you must have had your eyes closed when you embezzled it .
lisa simpson|you cut back on building materials and kept all the money for yourself !
lisa simpson|that's what happened .
lisa simpson|but everyone will know you did this !
lisa simpson|it's hopeless .
lisa simpson|utterly , utterly hopeless .
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|um , do you know what you're doing ?
lisa simpson|bob , look !
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|no , chief , bob's innocent !
lisa simpson|it's the truth !
lisa simpson|i love everything about the world of babysitting the responsibility , the obligation , the pressure ^
lisa simpson|that's a trust , janey .
lisa simpson|a sacred trust .
lisa simpson|why hasn't anyone called ?
lisa simpson|but ^
lisa simpson|but i'm very mature for my age .
lisa simpson|people often mistake me for nine .
lisa simpson|i'll do it !
lisa simpson|i'll babysit !
lisa simpson|but i'm smart and responsible , and my parents will be right next door !
lisa simpson|please , please , please !
lisa simpson|don't worry .
lisa simpson|a moth is no more harmful than a ladybug .
lisa simpson|oh , they're going to get eaten alive in middle school .
lisa simpson|once there was a robot named todd ^
lisa simpson|yes , he had a brother robot named rod , who was two spaceyears older than him .
lisa simpson|okay , chief .
lisa simpson|enjoy bob saget !
lisa simpson|now put your left leg into the left side of the pants and you're done .
lisa simpson|thanks for the ride !

lisa simpson|you look so glamorous , mom !
lisa simpson|oh , and you smell like vanilla flowers !
lisa simpson|it'll be dark .
lisa simpson|bart , i know you're not wild about having me for a babysitter , but i'm not some ogre .
lisa simpson|i think you will find me fair and fun .
lisa simpson|you should wash up for dinner .
lisa simpson|to make it fun , you can use the mr bubble it'll be like giving your fingers a bubble bath !
lisa simpson|certainly .
lisa simpson|certainly .
lisa simpson|uh , maybe you should eat the ones you have .
lisa simpson|bart , if you don't want to have a babysitter , maybe you should stop being such a baby .
lisa simpson|even babies know how to open and close their mouths .
lisa simpson|you need a bib .
lisa simpson|oh , look , bart , now you got maggie all upset !
lisa simpson|bart , that's coffee ice cream !

lisa simpson|okay , bart , now it's really time for you to go to bed !

lisa simpson|just try not to freak out the blind man .
lisa simpson|oh , it's for my junior achievers club .
lisa simpson|we're trying to earn money by recycling .
lisa simpson|mom , mom , you're mixing polyethylene with polyurethane !
lisa simpson|and you have to cut these up first .
lisa simpson|otherwise animals get caught in them .
lisa simpson|i could still use more paper .
lisa simpson|dad !
lisa simpson|you're not supposed to have fun recycling .
lisa simpson|this is serious .
lisa simpson|yes .
lisa simpson|um , does your plant have a recycling program ?
lisa simpson|hmm .
lisa simpson|you've never heard of recycling ?
lisa simpson|it means to reuse things to conserve our natural resources .
lisa simpson|but nature's not our enemy .
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|i don't agree !
lisa simpson|but according to your most recent biography , you only have one hundred million dollars today .
lisa simpson|but we didn't do that badly .
lisa simpson|we collected enough paper to save one whole tree .
lisa simpson|i normally don't laugh at other people's misfortunes , but on behalf of the recycling community ha !
lisa simpson|it couldn't happen to anyone more deserving .
lisa simpson|dad , if you just drink one more , i'll have a full bag .
lisa simpson|there's got to be more trash around here somewhere ^
lisa simpson|thanks , dad !
lisa simpson|what do you mean you don't have anything to recycle ?

lisa simpson|not good money , really .
lisa simpson|each can'll get you a nickel .
lisa simpson|there's a can .
lisa simpson|you have to cut these sixpack holders up .
lisa simpson|otherwise fish get trapped in them .
lisa simpson|oh , i'm not doing this for the money .
lisa simpson|i'm just happy knowing that future generations will enjoy unspoiled median strips and pristine highway embankments .
lisa simpson|you guys shouldn't laugh at him .
lisa simpson|mr burns has changed .
lisa simpson|he's different now .
lisa simpson|mr burns , if you want people to do a good job , you can't bully them .

lisa simpson|oh , miss hoover , movies are a nice break , but couldn't we be doing something a little more challenging ?
lisa simpson|where's miss hoover ?
lisa simpson|it's not my nature to complain , but so far today we've had three movies , two film strips , and an hour and a half of magazine time .
lisa simpson|i just don't feel challenged .
lisa simpson|when do you expect the ringing will stop ?
lisa simpson|look at how disciplined they are .
lisa simpson|they're just like the terra cotta warriors of xian .
lisa simpson|they're discussing poetry !
lisa simpson|oh !
lisa simpson|we never do that at my school !
lisa simpson|and so am i !
lisa simpson|this school has everything i ever wanted .
lisa simpson|yes .
lisa simpson|all i want is a chance to prove myself .

lisa simpson|talk about getting off on the wrong foot ^
lisa simpson|heh heh .
lisa simpson|is there any answer i can give that won't result in more pushups ?
lisa simpson|hey , look , it's the school motto .
lisa simpson|apparently tim was someone who was with the general moments before he was shot right in the head .
lisa simpson|that's how they want you to feel .
lisa simpson|but if you just hang in there , they'll eventually accept you .
lisa simpson|hey , what about me ?

lisa simpson|and went crazy as a loon .
lisa simpson|ech , i'm tired of being an issue , bart .
lisa simpson|maybe everyone would be better off if i just quit .

lisa simpson|ralph and i could do the report together .
lisa simpson|so in 1966 , a brave young man named seymour skinner enlisted and shipped out to vietnam , where he rose to become platoon sergeant .
lisa simpson|ralph ?
lisa simpson|sgt .
lisa simpson|skinner was a hero .
lisa simpson|he risked capture many times behind enemy lines .
lisa simpson|and he survived to make it back to springfield , where he became the fine educator we salute tonight .
lisa simpson|i admit sgt .
lisa simpson|skinner seems okay ^
lisa simpson|but mr tamzarian pulled himself up from the streets and earned our respect and admiration .
lisa simpson|his name doesn't matter .
lisa simpson|a rose by any other name would smell as sweet .
lisa simpson|but dad , i'm supposed to practice an hour a day !
lisa simpson|you'll practice me ?
lisa simpson|what does that mean ?
lisa simpson|is it supposed to be some sort of threat ?
lisa simpson|look , bart .

lisa simpson|it's not how it looks , it's how it sounds .
lisa simpson|dear lisa , may your new saxophone bring you years of d'oh !
lisa simpson|that's not gonna protect us from anything .
lisa simpson|i won't .
lisa simpson|i know it's good .

lisa simpson|if they're really witches , why don't they use their powers to escape ?
lisa simpson|never mind .
lisa simpson|bart , quit it !

lisa simpson|dad , that was really mean .
lisa simpson|i don't want to make the team .
lisa simpson|i got it .

lisa simpson|dad , those peanuts aren't for you , they're for the elephant .
lisa simpson|why would a motorboat have a mast ?
lisa simpson|hey , they can't just build a parking lot on saber tooth meadow .
lisa simpson|that's where they discovered all those fossils !
lisa simpson|but they might be paving over rare specimens .

lisa simpson|look , there's more .
lisa simpson|what the heck is this thing ?
lisa simpson|oh , my goodness .
lisa simpson|it looks like a human skeleton ^
lisa simpson|but these other bones look almost like wings .
lisa simpson|but it can't be an angel !
lisa simpson|well , maybe it's , uh , uh ^
lisa simpson|a neanderthal , who got bitten by some angry fish .
lisa simpson|it could be anything .
lisa simpson|it could be a mutant from the nuclear plant .

lisa simpson|what were the results , professor ?
lisa simpson|dad , it's not fair to claim this thing is an angel .
lisa simpson|there's no proof of that .
lisa simpson|what about that sign right there ?
lisa simpson|just let me take it to the museum for one day .
lisa simpson|they can do scientific tests and prove it's not an angel .
lisa simpson|wow ^
lisa simpson|so lifelike .
lisa simpson|it's a bone scraping from that skeleton i found .
lisa simpson|quite preposterous .
lisa simpson|but no one will believe me until i can prove what it really is .
lisa simpson|can't you do a dna test or something ?
lisa simpson|oh , thank you so much !
lisa simpson|uhm ^
lisa simpson|you know i can't afford to pay you .
lisa simpson|excuse me .

lisa simpson|what grown person could believe in angels ?
lisa simpson|you ?
lisa simpson|but ^
lisa simpson|you're an intelligent person , mom .
lisa simpson|it's not that i don't have a spiritual side .
lisa simpson|i just find it hard to believe there's a dead angel hanging in our garage .
lisa simpson|don't feel sorry for me , mom .
lisa simpson|i feel sorry for you .
lisa simpson|kent .
lisa simpson|i just think it's a fantasy .
lisa simpson|if you believe in angels , then why not unicorns , or sea monsters , or leprechauns ?
lisa simpson|look , you can either accept science and face reality , or you can believe in angels and live in a childish dream world .
lisa simpson|ugh , i wish i'd never found those stupid bones !
lisa simpson|it's time to put an end to this .
lisa simpson|bart , i'm borrowing your blue crowbar .
lisa simpson|it's gone ^
lisa simpson|nothing .
lisa simpson|someone must have stolen it .
lisa simpson|hardly .
lisa simpson|anyone could have written that .
lisa simpson|will you leave me alone ?
lisa simpson|it's bad enough you're making me go to your stupid judgment day .
lisa simpson|nothing is going to happen , mom .
lisa simpson|i hate to disappoint you , but the world is not coming to an end .
lisa simpson|well , there you go .
lisa simpson|wait a second !

lisa simpson|this was all a big hoax .
lisa simpson|you exploited people's deepest beliefs just to hawk your cheesy wares ?
lisa simpson|well , we are outraged !
lisa simpson|aren't we ?
lisa simpson|i don't understand , professor .
lisa simpson|why didn't your tests show the skeleton was a fake ?
lisa simpson|well , it was just so loud and ^

lisa simpson|many people in this town / sing like we do / there's mister burns , there's krusty , and even apu .
lisa simpson|because he was singing , we overheard his plan / and could save those dogs from that mean old man .

lisa simpson|bart , get out of my anchor chair .
lisa simpson|come on , this isn't a joke .
lisa simpson|all over town , kids are just waking up from their naps , cranky and hungry for the news .
lisa simpson|thank you .
lisa simpson|our top story today in a move that could affect children townwide , the library bookpurchase committee slashed its budget by three percent .
lisa simpson|first on the chopping block , periodicals .
lisa simpson|and now , sports .
lisa simpson|sorry , bart , but you've got to take some things seriously .

lisa simpson|i don't need a coanchor .
lisa simpson|i'm a straight a student .
lisa simpson|what is zazz ?
lisa simpson|zork ?
lisa simpson|what is zork ?
lisa simpson|but that trivializes the whole idea of kids news .
lisa simpson|i mean , let's be honest .
lisa simpson|bart's not exactly the brightest penny in the fountain .
lisa simpson|look , i love bart ^
lisa simpson|but he's never even read a newspaper .
lisa simpson|between you and me , he's well ^
lisa simpson|kinda dumb .
lisa simpson|we'll bring you more on this chalk shortage as it continues .
lisa simpson|and now , bart's been looking into that alleged ham salad from yesterday's school lunch .
lisa simpson|that's kids news .

lisa simpson|that wasn't news .
lisa simpson|that was sappy manipulative drivel .
lisa simpson|you didn't feel for him either , you big fat phony .
lisa simpson|it's lisa .
lisa simpson|they want cheap sentiment ?
lisa simpson|i'll pump 'em so full of sap they'll be blowing their nose with a pancake .
lisa simpson|they call her the cat lady .
lisa simpson|people say she's crazy , just because she has a few dozen cats .
lisa simpson|but can anyone who loves animals that much really be crazy ?
lisa simpson|the old union pacific doesn't come by here much anymore ^
lisa simpson|hmm , thank you , bart , for yet another touching bart's people .
lisa simpson|that's what veterans day is for , bart .

lisa simpson|well , he's ^
lisa simpson|your son !
lisa simpson|well , not literally .
lisa simpson|but in a way , isn't he everyone's son ?
lisa simpson|for you see , that little hellraiser is the spawn of every shrieking commercial , every brainrotting soda pop , every teacher who cares less about young minds than about cashing their big , fat paychecks .
lisa simpson|no , bart's not to blame .
lisa simpson|you can't create a monster and then whine when he stomps on a few buildings .
lisa simpson|i'm lisa simpson .
lisa simpson|boy , that phony schmaltz of yours sure is powerful stuff .
lisa simpson|you know , bart , if we combined your showmanship with my integrity , we could make kids really care about the news .
lisa simpson|i can't believe they cancelled us for this stupid ^
lisa simpson|come on , mom , the stores just invented this holiday to make money .
lisa simpson|uh , what a terrible waste !
lisa simpson|it's full , dad .

lisa simpson|yes .
lisa simpson|aren't you gonna buy it , dad ?
lisa simpson|wow , dad , you're really working hard .

lisa simpson|i cheated on that test .
lisa simpson|that's one grade i truly earned .

lisa simpson|a web page is supposed to be a personal thing .

lisa simpson|mom wants you to come to bed .

lisa simpson|you can't post that on the internet .
lisa simpson|you don't even know if it's true .
lisa simpson|i'm happy you got the potholes filled , but it's still irresponsible to present rumors as facts .
lisa simpson|maybe you should quit while you're ahead .
lisa simpson|well , you can't post news if you don't have any .
lisa simpson|at least take off your pulitzer prize when you say that .
lisa simpson|oh , dad ^

lisa simpson|but , there's a simple and highly satisfying explanation .

lisa simpson|the cirque de purée .
lisa simpson|we've had tickets since septembre .

lisa simpson|dad , as intelligence goes up , happiness often goes down .
lisa simpson|in fact , i made a graph .
lisa simpson|i make a lot of graphs .
lisa simpson|oh , many things tai chi , chai tea ^

lisa simpson|he wouldn't !
lisa simpson|dad , how could you ?
lisa simpson|we were connecting in such a meaningful way .

lisa simpson|who'd want candy filled with laxatives ?
lisa simpson|does anyone else want to know why that sign is so funny ?
lisa simpson|c'mon , we're gonna be late to the blooming of the sumatran century flower .
lisa simpson|because i know every time you say pick a number from one to ten , it's always seven .

lisa simpson|oh , bart , why'd you ask him a followup question ?
lisa simpson|cyrus ?
lisa simpson|you never mentioned him before .
lisa simpson|that's quite a tale , grampa .
lisa simpson|santa must have left it .
lisa simpson|i don't know , dad .
lisa simpson|this time of year everybody does it , 'cause you don't have to pay for the music rights .

lisa simpson|my malibu stacy heads !
lisa simpson|oh no , bart blamed this on the dog !
lisa simpson|i didn't pet him for weeks !
lisa simpson|oh , i'm sorry i doubted you , boy .
lisa simpson|we've only brought in five dollars .
lisa simpson|and that came from mr flanders buying back his own stuff .
lisa simpson|well maggie , i always knew it would some day boil down to just you and me .
lisa simpson|i'll look for work in the morning .
lisa simpson|my saxophone !
lisa simpson|you're a jerk !
lisa simpson|i'm telling mom !
lisa simpson|willie ?
lisa simpson|i hope i'm not being too personal , but you seem resigned to a life of abject squalor .

lisa simpson|adequate ^
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|willie could have a better life !
lisa simpson|if only someone showed him how ^
lisa simpson|i bet i could turn him into a proper gentleman !

lisa simpson|i think you'll find that deep down , anyone can be civilized .
lisa simpson|goodnight , willie .
lisa simpson|willie , in the next few weeks i'll be teaching you poise , pronunciation and posture .
lisa simpson|let's see you stand up as straight as you can .

lisa simpson|i believe in you !

lisa simpson|i think he's got it !

lisa simpson|dad , get your own song .
lisa simpson|you're a smash g .
lisa simpson|k .
lisa simpson|that's where you're wrong , principal skinner .
lisa simpson|i did enter a project ^
lisa simpson|and it's been in plain sight the entire evening !
lisa simpson|mr g .
lisa simpson|k .
lisa simpson|willington is not who he seems .
lisa simpson|in fact , he's someone you all know quite well !
lisa simpson|i give you ^
lisa simpson|groundskeeper willie !
lisa simpson|hm ^
lisa simpson|maybe there's room on my sports wall .
lisa simpson|now you have a friend .
lisa simpson|willie , there are no more lessons .
lisa simpson|you're a proper gentleman , my work is done .
lisa simpson|i think this is the perfect job for the new you , willie .
lisa simpson|it requires sophistication , tact , and you get to meet the highest class of people .
lisa simpson|so , how you doin' , willie ?
lisa simpson|with one little difference .
lisa simpson|i understand .
lisa simpson|don't worry , bart .
lisa simpson|i brought something that'll keep you interested a nickel in a water bottle !
lisa simpson|it's so impressive .
lisa simpson|oh no !
lisa simpson|this chamber's not on the map !
lisa simpson|we could be stuck in here forever if we don't find a way out !
lisa simpson|i'll stay with you , dad .
lisa simpson|sure .
lisa simpson|oh .
lisa simpson|all right , um , i'll tell you something that happened to me last week .
lisa simpson|i was walking home from school ^
lisa simpson|when suddenly i heard ^
lisa simpson|hello , mr bighorn sheep !
lisa simpson|i've read about you .
lisa simpson|you're shy , and you rarely approach humans !
lisa simpson|and of course you'd never attack a fellow herbivore !
lisa simpson|mad beast !
lisa simpson|c'mon !
lisa simpson|maybe mr smithers will help us .
lisa simpson|you worked at moe's ?
lisa simpson|i understand .
lisa simpson|i'll just read a magazine .
lisa simpson|yeah it's like the play within a play in hamlet .
lisa simpson|let's see ^
lisa simpson|it's like when you watch old home movies of you watching tv .
lisa simpson|treasure ?
lisa simpson|well , my best recollection of burns' paraphrasing of what he read in moe's letter is that krabappel told moe ^
lisa simpson|my pearl necklace !
lisa simpson|i must have lost it , and you were just bringing it back to me .
lisa simpson|how did you find this ?
lisa simpson|i want a photo of the hero who risked his life to save me !
lisa simpson|mr burns got his plant back , and i like to think i found a shred of humanity in his withered soul .
lisa simpson|aw dad , did my story make you cry ?
lisa simpson|ready !
lisa simpson|that was awesome !
lisa simpson|i wanna go to the showbiz animal retirement home .
lisa simpson|they take in animals from the movies and tv that aren't cute anymore .
lisa simpson|uh ^
lisa simpson|sure .
lisa simpson|this is much sadder than i expected .
lisa simpson|she looks like she's crying .
lisa simpson|no , no , it's still kidnapped .
lisa simpson|the prefix applies to the victim .
lisa simpson|dad , you can't keep this up for long .
lisa simpson|maybe there's another way to solve this .
lisa simpson|bart is clearly fulfilling an emotional need for toottoot .
lisa simpson|hey , i know how we can save bart .
lisa simpson|he also happens to be toottoot's son .
lisa simpson|nelson , funny town doesn't exist .
lisa simpson|listen , we can trade mr teeny for bart .
lisa simpson|we just have to find a way to get him up there .

lisa simpson|wow , there's a rainbow outside .
lisa simpson|i already saw that exact same show on another network .

lisa simpson|i don't understand , dad .
lisa simpson|our family has so many flaws .
lisa simpson|why must we share them with the world ?
lisa simpson|but dad ^
lisa simpson|forget it .
lisa simpson|fox flew me out here to bring you back .
lisa simpson|they flew me on frito lay's air force yum !
lisa simpson|and i'm required to say come to the cool ranch and rope in flavor .
lisa simpson|yee ha .
lisa simpson|i know who donald trump is .
lisa simpson|yeah , the only thing we're known for is leading the country in heart attacks .
lisa simpson|it's so strange that the commissioner didn't show up .
lisa simpson|we're not dead ^
lisa simpson|and neither are you .
lisa simpson|suicide ?
lisa simpson|no !
lisa simpson|wait !
lisa simpson|wait !
lisa simpson|bullfighting is a cruel , pseudosport !
lisa simpson|how many bulls / must my grandfather kill ^
lisa simpson|dad , that's mac tonight .
lisa simpson|grampa , i think you should give up the bullfighting .
lisa simpson|but you just got a new lease on life .
lisa simpson|why would you want to use it to hurt poor , helpless animals ?
lisa simpson|i was always cheering for you , grampa .

lisa simpson|what about this swordfish ?
lisa simpson|i know one , about the most important sea voyage in american history .
lisa simpson|the journey of the mayflower .

lisa simpson|the year was sixteen twenty ^
lisa simpson|mother , we must protect him .
lisa simpson|look , he's praying .
lisa simpson|and i will make thee a hat from construction paper !
lisa simpson|i keep telling you , the ability to add twodigit numbers is not witchcraft !
lisa simpson|seventyfour .
lisa simpson|we haven't gotten our food yet !
lisa simpson|i'm starting to think the sea captain isn't coming back .
lisa simpson|and you've got the elderly jewish couple making their first trip to israel .
lisa simpson|we're the band .
lisa simpson|and we're on !
lisa simpson|i think we're heading for disaster / and most of you will not be saved ^
lisa simpson|unless the captain is attentive / we'll all be crushed by a huge wave ^
lisa simpson|this hatchway is jammed !
lisa simpson|okay , the engine room is just through this flooded area .
lisa simpson|somebody has to take the rope , swim through to the other side , and tie it off so we can use it as an underwater guide line .
lisa simpson|i can't wait to see this reimagining of itchy and scratchy ^
lisa simpson|by avantgarde director juliana krellner !
lisa simpson|i love the use of streamers as blood .
lisa simpson|it robs the violence of its power .
lisa simpson|yeah , one for boys and one for girls .
lisa simpson|it's so beautiful .
lisa simpson|ooh , paintings by female artists !
lisa simpson|frida kahlo , georgia o'keefe ^
lisa simpson|cathy guisewite !

lisa simpson|he forgot the volume of the carrot nose onethird base times height !
lisa simpson|oh math , i have missed you !
lisa simpson|principal skinner ?
lisa simpson|assistant groundskeeper skinner , don't you think it's wrong that i can't get the best math education because i'm a girl ?
lisa simpson|mom , the girls' school is a joke and i'm not allowed to take the boys' math .
lisa simpson|that's right .
lisa simpson|i'm toilet .
lisa simpson|well , what can i do ?
lisa simpson|they won't let me in the boys' school .
lisa simpson|mom , i don't think this will fool anybody .
lisa simpson|what're you playing ?
lisa simpson|i'm ^
lisa simpson|jake .
lisa simpson|uh ^
lisa simpson|boy ^
lisa simpson|man ^
lisa simpson|boyman .
lisa simpson|jake boyman .
lisa simpson|yeah , i guess i do .
lisa simpson|my name isn't toilet it's jake !
lisa simpson|what are you drawing ?
lisa simpson|that's easy just one , the number five .
lisa simpson|so ^
lisa simpson|do you miss having the girls around ?
lisa simpson|did you know lisa simpson ?
lisa simpson|i heard she was pretty cool .
lisa simpson|what the hell are you talking about ?
lisa simpson|i have to go .
lisa simpson|nelson , you're not really angry at me .
lisa simpson|you're full of rage 'cause your father abandoned you .
lisa simpson|and because you're poor , so you don't feel like you're good enough .
lisa simpson|you just want somebody to say i love you .
lisa simpson|i love you .
lisa simpson|eep .
lisa simpson|not yet .
lisa simpson|if i do , she'll never let me go to the boys' math class again .
lisa simpson|you'd do that for me ?
lisa simpson|that is so sweet .
lisa simpson|ow , that hurt .
lisa simpson|i'm gonna be sick .
lisa simpson|what have i become ?
lisa simpson|fine , i'll beat up ralph .
lisa simpson|uh , give me your lunch money .

lisa simpson|uh ^
lisa simpson|forgive me for this .
lisa simpson|sure !
lisa simpson|peew !
lisa simpson|peew !
lisa simpson|thank you .
lisa simpson|or should i say thank you !
lisa simpson|that's right , everyone .
lisa simpson|the best math student in the whole school is a girl !
lisa simpson|that's a lie !
lisa simpson|i always thought that boys had it easier .
lisa simpson|but now i see their world is more cruel and sadistic than i ever imagined .
lisa simpson|and i did get better at math , but it was only by abandoning everything i believed in .
lisa simpson|i guess the real reason we don't see many women in math and science is ^
lisa simpson|well , whatever the answer is , i'm glad i'm a girl and i'm glad i'm good at math .
lisa simpson|now enjoy your stupid flautist .
lisa simpson|dad , all you had to do was paint one number .
lisa simpson|now no one's gonna be able to find our house .
lisa simpson|mom , what are you doing ?
lisa simpson|this is a total stranger who cleans houses for a living .
lisa simpson|who cares what she thinks ?
lisa simpson|i'm lisa , i'm eight years old , and this might sound presumptuous , but i'm your favorite .
lisa simpson|well , talk to me in a week .
lisa simpson|the sound of the baby must have triggered a primal mnemonic response in mom's brain .
lisa simpson|this is horrible .
lisa simpson|dad , we don't want you to leave !
lisa simpson|well , now it's time for my summer activity .
lisa simpson|you promised we could go to a museum .
lisa simpson|i'm so glad you picked the museum of natural history , mom .
lisa simpson|bart , it's still history .
lisa simpson|creationism ?
lisa simpson|but that's not science .
lisa simpson|how can you teach the book of genesis as a scientific theory ?
lisa simpson|this is slander !
lisa simpson|darwin was one of the greatest minds of all time !
lisa simpson|evolution is widely acknowledged as scientific fact .
lisa simpson|it's even accepted by prominent conservatives , like george will and the late pope john paul !
lisa simpson|they're making us learn creation theory in school .
lisa simpson|today we had a test , and every answer was god did it .
lisa simpson|but they're incompatible !
lisa simpson|mom , you really have to choose here , between science and belief .
lisa simpson|dad , you're not really reconsidering evolution , are you ?
lisa simpson|i have an issue i'd like to raise !
lisa simpson|last week , the unscientific theory of creationism was introduced alongside evolution in springfield public schools .
lisa simpson|evolution and creationism cannot coexist , people .
lisa simpson|it is time to go back to teaching one single truth !
lisa simpson|i'm so glad you could all come .
lisa simpson|i'll be reading to you from the origin of species by charles darwin .
lisa simpson|chapter one when we compare the individuals of the same variety or subvariety of our older cultivated plants and animals ^
lisa simpson|there are so many worse crimes .
lisa simpson|why are you persecuting me ?
lisa simpson|i'm sorry , mom .
lisa simpson|i should have just gone with the flow like you said .
lisa simpson|thanks , mom .
lisa simpson|mr flanders , wait !
lisa simpson|i want you to know , i respect your beliefs and i can see how deeply you feel about them .
lisa simpson|i just don't think religion should be taught in our schools , any more than you'd want scientists teaching at the church .
lisa simpson|it's amazing they've gotten five hundred and twelve shows out of this premise .
lisa simpson|but , grampa , in nineteen fortytwo , they only played women's baseball here .
lisa simpson|shake it off , buck !
lisa simpson|i concur !
lisa simpson|isn't it weird that our parents are giving marital advice ?
lisa simpson|they're always fighting if you listen closely , you can hear them arguing right now .
lisa simpson|otto , help me !
lisa simpson|i'm not afraid of you .
lisa simpson|i understand .
lisa simpson|i'm not like my dad either .
lisa simpson|there's a triple a battery in my macaroni and cheese !
lisa simpson|i can't eat this .
lisa simpson|well , you're not gonna find any here .
lisa simpson|it's delicious !
lisa simpson|no , it's great !
lisa simpson|except for the bee !
lisa simpson|you could make a great chef someday .
lisa simpson|mom !
lisa simpson|oh michael , one bite of this soufflé and your father will realize your gift deserves to flower .
lisa simpson|fat tony , it's not important what other people think of you .
lisa simpson|what matters is how you feel , inside !
lisa simpson|where did you get that ?
lisa simpson|it's so great that michael's doing what he loves .
lisa simpson|why didn't you tell him it was an accident ?
lisa simpson|it was an accident , right ?
lisa simpson|michael ?
lisa simpson|michael ?
lisa simpson|you guys need a break .
lisa simpson|why don't i take bart with me to the children's bebop brunch at jazzy goodtime's ?
lisa simpson|hey bart , you wanna jam with me ?
lisa simpson|not bad for a newbie , bart !
lisa simpson|you just may be the secondbest player up here .
lisa simpson|in case you're wondering who the best one is , it's me .
lisa simpson|yes , i am .
lisa simpson|pleased to meet you .
lisa simpson|yes ^
lisa simpson|yes ?
lisa simpson|yes !
lisa simpson|oh , i can't believe ^
lisa simpson|'cause i've wanted to jam with jazz musicians all my life !
lisa simpson|how would bart like it if i just hopped on his skateboard and instantly became great ?
lisa simpson|mildmildmildmildmild !
lisa simpson|it's jazz !
lisa simpson|jazz !
lisa simpson|you don't even know the name of the thing you are stealing from me !
lisa simpson|i always wanted a jazz nickname !
lisa simpson|that is the most unfair ^
lisa simpson|bart , does that even mean anything ?
lisa simpson|mom , i'm gonna lose it !
lisa simpson|bart's on the cover of both local jazz magazines blowin' and the sugar sheet .
lisa simpson|here's the only thing i've been on the cover of .
lisa simpson|that might work .
lisa simpson|aww , they're all so cute .
lisa simpson|well , i kind of like this guy ^
lisa simpson|ooh , but this one is precious !
lisa simpson|okay , this little guy's coming home with me !
lisa simpson|who's gonna get neutered tomorrow ?
lisa simpson|you are !
lisa simpson|oh , yes you are .
lisa simpson|i did ?

lisa simpson|i won't get tired of him !
lisa simpson|i'll take him too !
lisa simpson|i'll take him too .
lisa simpson|okay , guys .
lisa simpson|no one knows you're here , so be quiet .
lisa simpson|and if you get hungry , there are rats living in the christmas decorations .
lisa simpson|shut up !
lisa simpson|i just said shut up .
lisa simpson|i'll punish myself by going upstairs .
lisa simpson|bart !
lisa simpson|what are you doing here ?
lisa simpson|no , buttercup !

bart simpson|my dog's name is santa's little helper .
bart simpson|one time he crawled under the house , and when he came out he was covered with ants .
bart simpson|then he ran into a church and drank all the holy water .
bart simpson|i thought i'd be jumping for joy the day skinner left , but now all i have is this weird hot feeling in the back of my head .

bart simpson|once chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten , he'll fire ned on the spot .
bart simpson|no problemo .

bart simpson|now here's what we do .
bart simpson|tomorrow morning when allison comes out of her house , we spray her with the hose , soaking her from head to toe , leaving us relatively dry .
bart simpson|well , there's bound to be some splashback .

bart simpson|leaving her primed for the most traumatic hosesoaking of her life .
bart simpson|lisa , here is as the french say , le fake diorama .
bart simpson|i'll create a diversion and you make the switch .

bart simpson|you shank .
bart simpson|how could you tell on me ?

bart simpson|come on , milhouse .
bart simpson|there's no such thing as a soul .

bart simpson|well , if your soul's real , where is it ?
bart simpson|uh huh .
bart simpson|what if you die in a submarine at the bottom of the ocean ?
bart simpson|how can someone with glasses that thick be so stupid ?

bart simpson|i hope they show the time where they traded guns to the indians for corn , and then the indians shot them and took the corn .

bart simpson|there's something unsettling about that .
bart simpson|what a perfect plan .

bart simpson|i never even heard about that .
bart simpson|i guess you don't need it now , but we had a plan too .
bart simpson|why did they make that one muppet out of leather ?

homer simpson|and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear .
homer simpson|well , when is he gonna act like it ?
homer simpson|herb , i don't think there's a vibrating chair in that bag for me .
homer simpson|what do i get ?
homer simpson|what do i get ?
homer simpson|it's not another punch in the face is it ?
homer simpson|because if it is , i don't want it .

homer simpson|heh , heh .
homer simpson|stick it to the man .
homer simpson|no , wait !
homer simpson|we'll call you back !
homer simpson|bart !

homer simpson|wee !
homer simpson|heh , heh , it does look like al gore .
homer simpson|marge , i agree with you , in theory .
homer simpson|in theory communism works .
homer simpson|in theory .
homer simpson|what's he yelling about ?
homer simpson|maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move it wouldn't get so hungry .
homer simpson|oh , everything's cruel according to you .
homer simpson|keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel .
homer simpson|pulling on his tail is cruel .
homer simpson|yelling in his ears is cruel .
homer simpson|everything is cruel .
homer simpson|so excuse me if i'm cruel .
homer simpson|now i've had my head in an elephant , a hippo and a giant sloth .
homer simpson|shut up .
homer simpson|plants , eh ?
homer simpson|hey , any more arboretums around here ?
homer simpson|that bird !
homer simpson|he's killing the elephant !

homer simpson|oh .
homer simpson|good luck .
homer simpson|look at these bills .
homer simpson|chain for elephant , shots for elephant ^
homer simpson|oversized decorative poncho .
homer simpson|well these bills'll have to be paid out of your allowance .
homer simpson|then that's what i'll do , smart guy .
homer simpson|for the ninth time , no !
homer simpson|wait a minute , this gives me an idea .
homer simpson|i don't have time to read .
homer simpson|just give me the gist of it , son .
homer simpson|your kid flew five feet .
homer simpson|that counts as a ride .
homer simpson|two bucks .
homer simpson|look at this , marge !
homer simpson|fiftyeight dollars !
homer simpson|and all of it profit !
homer simpson|i'm the smartest businessman in the world !
homer simpson|marge , please don't humiliate me in front of the money .
homer simpson|um , milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once .
homer simpson|right ?
homer simpson|well , that was under our old price structure .
homer simpson|under our new price structure , your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars .
homer simpson|now , you've already paid me four dollars , so that's just six hundred and ninetysix dollars more that you owe me .
homer simpson|this town is full of deadbeats .
homer simpson|we can't afford this elephant .
homer simpson|sorry , bart .
homer simpson|i'm gonna have to sell him .
homer simpson|what do you mean ?
homer simpson|it's an elephant , isn't it ?
homer simpson|he likes peanuts .
homer simpson|i only have two questions .
homer simpson|how much , and give it to me .
homer simpson|so , your bid is zero .
homer simpson|thank you .
homer simpson|thank you .
homer simpson|lisa , a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low .
homer simpson|don't worry , son .
homer simpson|i'll get you a new elephant .
homer simpson|done .
homer simpson|here's the keys .
homer simpson|i'll just keep these then .
homer simpson|he took bart too ?
homer simpson|that wasn't part of our deal , blackheart !
homer simpson|that wasn't paaaaart !
homer simpson|piece of cake .
homer simpson|all we have to do is follow the path of destruction .
homer simpson|stupid tornado .
homer simpson|look .
homer simpson|it got patty and selma .
homer simpson|elephant , honey .
homer simpson|it's an elephant .
homer simpson|and i'm sure he'll make a grand piano .
homer simpson|son , you're okay !
homer simpson|and you've led us to the precious ivory .
homer simpson|and of course your lovable pet , who it's connected to ^
homer simpson|forget it .
homer simpson|that elephant cost me thousands of dollars .
homer simpson|i'd like it fine .
homer simpson|yes , of course i would .
homer simpson|who wouldn't like that ?
homer simpson|to be part of the music scene ^
homer simpson|huh ?
homer simpson|nah , that's okay .
homer simpson|i'm pretty sure i can struggle my way out .
homer simpson|first i'll just reach in and pull my legs out .
homer simpson|now i'll pull my arms out with my face ^
homer simpson|i'm alive !
homer simpson|i'm alive .
homer simpson|and i owe it all to this feisty feline .
homer simpson|oh , i guess it wouldn't be right to sell stampy after he saved my life .
homer simpson|and , the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him .
homer simpson|on the other hand , who's to say what's right these days ^
homer simpson|what with all our modern ideas ^
homer simpson|and products .
homer simpson|all right .
homer simpson|we'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge .

homer simpson|woo hoo !
homer simpson|what do i get ?
homer simpson|woo hoo !

homer simpson|that's it , boy .
homer simpson|you're our last hope .
homer simpson|okay , boy , i wrote down exactly what to say .
homer simpson|just read it and you're a shooin .

homer simpson|it's those tv networks , marge .
homer simpson|they won't let me .
homer simpson|one quality show after another .
homer simpson|each one fresher and more brilliant than the last .
homer simpson|if they only stumbled once just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves .

homer simpson|oh , who am i kidding ?
homer simpson|i am slow ^
homer simpson|take another bath in malt liquor ?
homer simpson|oh , and how is education supposed to make me feel smarter ?
homer simpson|besides , every time i learn something new , it pushes some old stuff out of my brain .
homer simpson|remember when i took that home wine making course and i forgot how to drive ?
homer simpson|and how .
homer simpson|wait a minute , even lenny is teaching a class .
homer simpson|look at the way they admire and adore him .
homer simpson|that's it !
homer simpson|if he can teach a class , he can teach a class .
homer simpson|i mean , i can teach a class .
homer simpson|well ^
homer simpson|i can tell the difference between butter and i can't believe it's not butter .
homer simpson|i've failed again .
homer simpson|everybody can teach a class but me .
homer simpson|i'm an idiot .
homer simpson|what am i gonna tell my wife and kids ?
homer simpson|that depends .
homer simpson|is there another way to get this job ?
homer simpson|i'll do it !
homer simpson|anything to get me out of that house , away from all that nagging and noise ^
homer simpson|of a family of love .
homer simpson|sha la la la .
homer simpson|look , everyone !
homer simpson|now that i'm a teacher , i've sewed patches on my elbows .

homer simpson|very funny .
homer simpson|uh , yes , yes .
homer simpson|to the untrained eye i'm eating an orange .
homer simpson|but to the eye that has brains , i am making a point about marriage .
homer simpson|for you see , marriage is a lot like an orange .
homer simpson|first you have the skin , then the sweet , sweet innards .
homer simpson|okay .
homer simpson|but then we've got to get to work .
homer simpson|i told marge this wouldn't work the other night in bed .
homer simpson|no , that's not what i meant .
homer simpson|marge and i always talk things over in bed .
homer simpson|like the other night we were fighting about money .
homer simpson|i was telling marge that we could save some money if she only dyed her hair once a month .
homer simpson|oh yeah .
homer simpson|she's been gray as a mule since she was seventeen .
homer simpson|i went on for hours and they were hanging on my every word .
homer simpson|i really think i was born to teach .
homer simpson|come on , marge .
homer simpson|let me in !
homer simpson|there's crickets out here .
homer simpson|marge , i didn't tell 'em personal stuff .
homer simpson|oh , you mean about you .
homer simpson|all right , maybe i said some things some personal things .
homer simpson|but , you should have seen 'em , marge .
homer simpson|they really wanted to hear what i had to say .
homer simpson|look , marge , you don't know what it's like .
homer simpson|i'm the one there everyday , putting his ass on the line .
homer simpson|and i'm not out of order .
homer simpson|you're out of order .
homer simpson|the whole freakin' system is out of order .
homer simpson|you want the truth ?
homer simpson|you want the truth ?
homer simpson|you can't handle the truth .
homer simpson|'cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face , you'll know what to do .
homer simpson|forget it , marge it's chinatown .
homer simpson|yes ma'am .
homer simpson|now what is a wedding ?
homer simpson|well , webster's dictionary describes a wedding as 'the process of removing weeds from one's garden .
homer simpson|this is a place of learning , not a house of ^
homer simpson|hearing about things .
homer simpson|no , wait !
homer simpson|uh , uh , wait !
homer simpson|i , yes !
homer simpson|i do have a story about two other young marrieds .
homer simpson|now , the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom .
homer simpson|it seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow .
homer simpson|well let's just call 'em uh , mr x and mrs y .
homer simpson|so anyway , mr x would say , 'marge , if this doesn't get your motor running , my name isn't homer j .
homer simpson|simpson .
homer simpson|not tonight , marge .
homer simpson|tonight we can eat a nice , leisurely dinner at home .
homer simpson|marge , you'll never guess what .
homer simpson|my whole class is here .
homer simpson|they're going to observe the human peep show that is our lives .
homer simpson|so , little lisa , apple of my eye .
homer simpson|how are things down at the ol' schoolhouse ?
homer simpson|and how's my little major leaguer ?

homer simpson|son , i know you meant well , but that wasn't the right thing to do .
homer simpson|why you little ^
homer simpson|well , now that the little ones have toddled off to bed ^
homer simpson|all right , we're breaking early tonight , class .
homer simpson|for tomorrow , you should read pages seven through eighteen in lisa's diary .
homer simpson|huh ?
homer simpson|but i'm not in the cla ^
homer simpson|okay , marge , things were said , mistakes were made .
homer simpson|let's end this madness and get on with our lives .
homer simpson|but , i learned my lesson .
homer simpson|it'll never happen again .
homer simpson|aw , marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing .
homer simpson|honey , the door blew shut !
homer simpson|oh .
homer simpson|fine .
homer simpson|that's what you want ?
homer simpson|you got it .
homer simpson|this scene is gettin' old , man .

homer simpson|maybe i'll drop you a line someday from wherever i wind up in this crazy old world .
homer simpson|don't mind me boys , just scrubbing my undies .
homer simpson|keep up the roughhousing , son .
homer simpson|without a strong male presence in the house , you could turn sissy overnight .
homer simpson|oh , these stubborn grass stains .
homer simpson|oh , good , reverend lovejoy will make marge take me back .
homer simpson|he has to push the sanctity of marriage or his god will punish him .
homer simpson|good night , marge .
homer simpson|why didn't i take a picture ?
homer simpson|i had ten years to take a picture .
homer simpson|i love you ^
homer simpson|will you marry me , marge ?
homer simpson|you mean i'm gonna be a daddy ?
homer simpson|i hope we'll always be together ^
homer simpson|together ^
homer simpson|together ^
homer simpson|together ?
homer simpson|good news , lisa .
homer simpson|i don't need your mother anymore .

homer simpson|which they almost certainly would .
homer simpson|brothers , brothers .
homer simpson|brothers , i've learned a wonderful lesson .
homer simpson|helping others makes our own lives better and makes us better people .
homer simpson|so instead of just shooting pool and drinking beer , let us stonecutters use what we have to help the less fortunate .
homer simpson|you were right , lisa .
homer simpson|i've never felt so spiritually fulfilled .
homer simpson|and with my brothers , the stonecutters , behind me , this is the beginning of a better world for all of us .

homer simpson|it looks like we have two .
homer simpson|moom .
homer simpson|that's exciting .
homer simpson|well , i'm glad you asked .
homer simpson|it's actually a very interesting story .
homer simpson|it all began about two years ago , before maggie was even born .
homer simpson|bart , you were lisa's age and lisa you were the age bart was several years ago .
homer simpson|listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any tv show .
homer simpson|it was a tumultuous time for our nation .
homer simpson|the clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live .
homer simpson|the information superhighway showed the average person what some nerd thinks about star trek , and the domestication of the dog continued unabated .
homer simpson|i was at my work station when suddenly ^
homer simpson|not on my shift .
homer simpson|oh no you don't !
homer simpson|simpson ten , terrorists eight .
homer simpson|okay .
homer simpson|woo hoo !
homer simpson|this is it !
homer simpson|with this single glorious check , i'm finally completely out of debt .
homer simpson|yes !
homer simpson|with my bills paid off , i can finally quit this lousy job .
homer simpson|don't worry about homer j .
homer simpson|i've got a plan .
homer simpson|a plan that'll fix you good .
homer simpson|sorry , that just slipped out .
homer simpson|i'll miss ya .
homer simpson|did you hear me ?
homer simpson|i said , i quit , monty .
homer simpson|and since i quit , i can do anything i want .
homer simpson|ooh , lovely desk .
homer simpson|it would be too bad if someone , oh , i don't know ^
homer simpson|didn't use a coaster !
homer simpson|such a nice tidy office .
homer simpson|maybe it's time you started living like a pig !
homer simpson|oh , i hope i haven't upset you ^
homer simpson|bongo head !
homer simpson|that's for employing me for eight years !
homer simpson|ha ha .
homer simpson|and that is that .
homer simpson|goodbye mindnumbing , backbreaking labor forever .
homer simpson|hello dream job in paradise .
homer simpson|and now the final phase of my plan .
homer simpson|hey barney , any chance you can get me a job here ?
homer simpson|woo hoo !
homer simpson|why ?
homer simpson|don't worry , marge .
homer simpson|i've come up with a perfectly balanced budget .
homer simpson|there will be exactly enough money for you , me , bart and lisa , if we make a few small sacrifices .
homer simpson|from now on we use regular toilet paper , not that fancy quilted kind ^
homer simpson|and only one of you kids can go to college .
homer simpson|that night your mother and i went out for a romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life .
homer simpson|we began with dinner and dancing ^
homer simpson|followed by a stroll on the beach ^
homer simpson|marge ^
homer simpson|i've got sand in my underpants .
homer simpson|i love you , marge .
homer simpson|everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced .
homer simpson|i hope things stay exactly like this forever .
homer simpson|it's okay , marge .
homer simpson|they pave the way for this kind of filth in school .
homer simpson|actually , your mother hadn't told me yet .
homer simpson|at that time , i had no idea maggie even existed .
homer simpson|hi maggie .
homer simpson|so anyhoo , back then there was no way for me to know your mother was pregnant .
homer simpson|marge , you tie up the bathroom every morning .
homer simpson|i've got to wash my hair .
homer simpson|the next few weeks at my dream job were like a wonderful waking coma .
homer simpson|mmm ^
homer simpson|bowling fresh .
homer simpson|mmm ^
homer simpson|urinal fresh .
homer simpson|no .
homer simpson|i slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley , like where the pins go after they're knocked down .
homer simpson|i was in heaven .
homer simpson|if horse racing is the sport of kings , then surely bowling ^
homer simpson|is a very good sport as well .
homer simpson|i'm gonna make it after all !
homer simpson|can't talk , praying .
homer simpson|dear lord , the gods have been good to me and i am thankful .
homer simpson|for the first time in my life , everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is .
homer simpson|hey , wait a minute .
homer simpson|what are all these presents ?
homer simpson|it looks like you're showering marge with gifts .
homer simpson|well , it was my major .
homer simpson|so here's the deal you freeze everything as it is , and i won't ask for anything more .
homer simpson|if that is okay , please give me absolutely no sign .
homer simpson|okay , deal .
homer simpson|in gratitude , i present you this offering of cookies and milk .
homer simpson|if you want me to eat them for you , give me no sign .
homer simpson|thy will be done .
homer simpson|ah ^
homer simpson|another perfect day in my perfect life with my perfect job .
homer simpson|thank you .
homer simpson|thank you very much .
homer simpson|it is nice work .
homer simpson|it's true , the bundle is little .
homer simpson|but i'm not in it for the money .
homer simpson|this is getting very abstract , but thank you .
homer simpson|i do enjoy working at the bowling alley .
homer simpson|man .
homer simpson|it's windy as hell out there .
homer simpson|hmmm .
homer simpson|with little , tiny , babysized gifts .
homer simpson|well ^
homer simpson|i'll be in the tub .

homer simpson|marge is pregnant ?
homer simpson|nooooo !
homer simpson|oh just that one time .
homer simpson|you're pregnant ?
homer simpson|you're pregnant again ?
homer simpson|well who wouldn't be upset ?
homer simpson|that new baby in your mother's womb was a ticking time bomb threatening to blow this family eight ways from sunday !
homer simpson|hey , where're you going ?
homer simpson|you're pregnant !
homer simpson|we're gonna have to have a baby !
homer simpson|all our financial plans are ruined .
homer simpson|we're doomed !
homer simpson|doomed i tells ya !
homer simpson|yeah .

homer simpson|bowling here !
homer simpson|come bowl now !
homer simpson|get yer bowling !
homer simpson|who's ready ?
homer simpson|bowling !
homer simpson|my marketing plan attracted a record number of police and fire officials , but few stayed to bowl .
homer simpson|i failed .
homer simpson|quitting my dream job was the hardest thing i've ever done .
homer simpson|this was the happiest time of my life .
homer simpson|i'll never forget you guys .
homer simpson|especially you , joey .
homer simpson|don't worry , joey .
homer simpson|we'll make it to california some day .
homer simpson|i needed more money to support my growing family .
homer simpson|and there was only one place in town that a man like me could make it .
homer simpson|actually , i quit and i came to get my job back .
homer simpson|seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it .
homer simpson|thanks for giving me my old job back .
homer simpson|i've never been so miserable in all my life .
homer simpson|but i can't take it out on marge and the kids .
homer simpson|i've got to carry the burden all by myself .
homer simpson|hi honey , how are you ?
homer simpson|i can't go on with this charade any longer .
homer simpson|i hate my job .
homer simpson|i hate my life .
homer simpson|and ever since i found out about this baby there's been nothing but bad luck .
homer simpson|it's just in one ear and out the other with you isn't it , marge .
homer simpson|it's wonderful !
homer simpson|it's magical !
homer simpson|oh boy , here it comes another mouth .

homer simpson|and then i sped away without anyone seeing my license plate .
homer simpson|yeah , except i forgot to go to work .
homer simpson|will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet ?
homer simpson|it's going to be destroyed .
homer simpson|didn't you hear what the guy in the building said ?
homer simpson|lisa , the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time .
homer simpson|just like that rain forest scare a few years back .
homer simpson|our officials saw there was a problem , and they fixed it .
homer simpson|didn't they ?
homer simpson|there's that word again .
homer simpson|well then , i have a backup plan .
homer simpson|see , while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going doodoodoodeedoododoo ^
homer simpson|i'm getting to that .
homer simpson|so anyway , they're going , doodeedoododoo ^
homer simpson|so anyway we get in our car and take the bridge out of town , while all the while they're still going , doodeedoododoo ^
homer simpson|all right !
homer simpson|it's at times like this i wish i were a religious man .
homer simpson|just a second .
homer simpson|what's everyone so worked up about ?
homer simpson|so there's a comet .
homer simpson|big deal .
homer simpson|it'll burn up in our atmosphere , and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head .
homer simpson|of course i'm right .
homer simpson|if i'm not , may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow .
homer simpson|okay , if you're that worried about it , let's go down to the bomb shelter .

homer simpson|wow .
homer simpson|kids are so naïve .
homer simpson|lisa , when you get to be our age , you'll learn a few things , like when a sign says do not feed the bears , man , you'd better not feed the bears .
homer simpson|now get to school , boy .
homer simpson|man , these are primo seats .
homer simpson|i could really go for a hot dog .

homer simpson|i blew it again .

homer simpson|easy now , sweetheart .
homer simpson|homie's here .
homer simpson|you did what ?
homer simpson|nothing .
homer simpson|i'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop .
homer simpson|marge , you being a cop makes you the man , which makes me the woman .
homer simpson|and i have no interest in that , besides occasionally wearing the underwear , which , as we discussed , is strictly a comfort thing .
homer simpson|aw , thanks , honey .
homer simpson|marge , i want you to take care of yourself out there .
homer simpson|you've become very dear to me .
homer simpson|oh marge , one squirt and you're south of the border .

homer simpson|that's why it was so funny .
homer simpson|but they're not .
homer simpson|the girls of the internet .
homer simpson|ooh , i'd go on line with them any day .
homer simpson|are you kidding ?
homer simpson|being a cophusband is one mighty sweet deal this police radio entertains me with other peoples' miseries ;
homer simpson|we get a free funeral for marge , god forbid ;
homer simpson|hey , hurry it up with the cards , lenny .
homer simpson|i've got you clocked at two miles per hour .
homer simpson|all the more reason to hurry up .
homer simpson|marge , you chased away all my poker buddies .
homer simpson|oh , you've become such a cop !
homer simpson|and , not that long ago , you were so much more to me you were a cleaner of pots , a sewer of buttons , an unplugger of hairy clogs .
homer simpson|you're cooking what for dinner ?
homer simpson|hey , marge .
homer simpson|how's my little piglet ?
homer simpson|that's okay .
homer simpson|i'm supposed to be workin' , too .
homer simpson|i'll just be a second , marge .
homer simpson|i'm going to get some beer for those kids over there .
homer simpson|i'll be right back .
homer simpson|now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop .
homer simpson|c'mon , we're family .
homer simpson|i'll make you a deal .
homer simpson|you rip up that ticket , and i'll give you back your hat .
homer simpson|wuh , wuh , wuh !
homer simpson|hee , heehee !
homer simpson|what're you gonna do about it ?
homer simpson|what're you gonna do ?
homer simpson|ooh , i'm officer marge , i'm gonna arrest you !
homer simpson|whoa !
homer simpson|etc .
homer simpson|whuh !
homer simpson|marge , not here .
homer simpson|hey , you're not really arresting me ^
homer simpson|i choose to waive that right .
homer simpson|lemme just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte .
homer simpson|i have nothing more to say to you , marge .
homer simpson|i'm drawing a line down the center of the house à la i love lucy you stay on your side and i'll stay on my side .
homer simpson|boy , when marge first told me she was going to the police academy , i thought it'd be fun and exciting , you know , like that movie , spaceballs .
homer simpson|but instead , it's been painful and disturbing , like that movie police academy .
homer simpson|all right guys , pipe down .
homer simpson|i've got some more in the garage .
homer simpson|hmm ^
homer simpson|i wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage .
homer simpson|well , what do you call it ?
homer simpson|hey herman , i had to come out here to see what's so funny a counterfeit jeans ring operating out of my car hole !
homer simpson|i'm gonna tell everyone !
homer simpson|wait here .
homer simpson|okay .
homer simpson|herman , how could you ?
homer simpson|we've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another , but what about the victims ?
homer simpson|hard working designers , like calvin klein , gloria vanderbilt , or antoine bugle boy .
homer simpson|these are the people who saw an overcrowded marketplace and said , me too .
homer simpson|herman , your beef is with me .
homer simpson|leave the girl out of this .
homer simpson|it's too late for me , marge !
homer simpson|sell the jeans and live like a queen .
homer simpson|marge !
homer simpson|oh , marge .
homer simpson|you saved my life !
homer simpson|i'm sorry i teased you .
homer simpson|you're a really good cop .
homer simpson|i'm proud of you .
homer simpson|he's gettin' away !
homer simpson|you blew it , marge !
homer simpson|marge , how did you know ^
homer simpson|no , what i was wondering is ^

homer simpson|yes , bart's a tutor now .
homer simpson|tute on , son !
homer simpson|tute on !
homer simpson|now , marge , you can't blame all of bart's problems on your one little speech .

homer simpson|and let's not forget your little speech ^
homer simpson|yes , there is .
homer simpson|come on , everybody , let's go into shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves !

homer simpson|maybe we did fake a kidnapping , but is that really such a crime ?
homer simpson|all your son wanted was a little attention , a little love .
homer simpson|i'm a father myself , sir .
homer simpson|and sure , sometimes my kids can be obnoxious ^
homer simpson|or boring ^
homer simpson|but they can always count on one thing their father's unconditional love .

homer simpson|i'm sure we will , honey .
homer simpson|i'm sure we will .
homer simpson|yeah , hi , roy .
homer simpson|hey , they're having open casting for the voice of poochie .
homer simpson|i do not !
homer simpson|i prefer to listen to cheap trick .
homer simpson|hey , this is homer simpson sayin' howdy to all the girls out there in radioland .
homer simpson|hey , this is homer simpson sayin' i don't sound like that , do i ?
homer simpson|oh , i don't like having such a hilarious voice .
homer simpson|ruff ruff !
homer simpson|i'm poochie the rockin' dog .
homer simpson|oh , no attitude , eh ?
homer simpson|not inyourface , huh ?
homer simpson|well , you can cram it with walnuts , ugly !
homer simpson|huh ?
homer simpson|i can't .
homer simpson|i don't remember what i did .
homer simpson|oh , i don't get the job , do i ?
homer simpson|well , boohoo , i don't get to be a cartoon dog .
homer simpson|oh , now i got the job , huh ?
homer simpson|oh .
homer simpson|thank you .
homer simpson|she smells sheet smells by the sheet store .
homer simpson|wait , wait .
homer simpson|lemme try it again .
homer simpson|you ?
homer simpson|but you're a lady .

homer simpson|how'd you get to be so good ?
homer simpson|you mean meep meep ?
homer simpson|uh , i guess .
homer simpson|is this episode going on the air live ?
homer simpson|i'll field this one .
homer simpson|let me ask you a question why would a man whose shirt says genius at work spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show ?
homer simpson|what the hell are you talking about ?
homer simpson|quiet !
homer simpson|you're missing the jokes !
homer simpson|well ?
homer simpson|what did everybody think ?
homer simpson|so it was pretty okay , huh ?
homer simpson|well , at least i liked it .
homer simpson|didn't i ?
homer simpson|i'm the worst poochie ever .
homer simpson|then they said they were gonna kill poochie off !
homer simpson|you're right , marge !
homer simpson|it's not my fault !
homer simpson|i'm not gonna let 'em treat poochie like dirt anymore just 'cause he's the new guy !
homer simpson|put a sock in it , roy .
homer simpson|no i am not .
homer simpson|never !
homer simpson|you can't just kill off a classic tv character .
homer simpson|poochie could be bigger than curly fries , but first he has to win back the audience .
homer simpson|that's why i'm gonna read these lines i wrote myself with my own two hands .
homer simpson|yes .
homer simpson|i certainly do .
homer simpson|hello there , itchy .
homer simpson|i know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish i would go away , but i think we got off on the wrong foot .
homer simpson|i know i can come off a little proactive , and for that i'm sorry .
homer simpson|but if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted , i know we can make 'em laugh and cry until we grow old together .
homer simpson|now , kids i know you loved the old poochie ^
homer simpson|but the new one's going to be better than ten superbowls .
homer simpson|i don't want to oversell it .
homer simpson|judge for yourselves .
homer simpson|hey , that wasn't supposed to happen !
homer simpson|those finks doublecrossed me !
homer simpson|well , i guess i learned my lesson .
homer simpson|the thing is , i lost creative control of the project .
homer simpson|and i forgot to ask for any money .
homer simpson|well , live and learn .
homer simpson|nine hundred dollars ?
homer simpson|well , we'll have to dip into the retirement fund again .
homer simpson|aw , nuts .
homer simpson|hello ?
homer simpson|china ?
homer simpson|little help ?
homer simpson|that is so true .
homer simpson|what happened ?
homer simpson|give her a break !
homer simpson|her husband was killed !
homer simpson|okay , so maybe that thing's a hunk of junk , but look at what you're selling !
homer simpson|fifty bucks for a toy ?
homer simpson|no kid is worth that .
homer simpson|no .
homer simpson|how can you love a box , or a toy , or graphics ?
homer simpson|you're a grown man .
homer simpson|oh , yeah .
homer simpson|like when a clown dies .
homer simpson|and that kind of stuff is worth money ?
homer simpson|man , you should come over to our place .
homer simpson|it's full of valuable , worthless crap !
homer simpson|i practically insist .
homer simpson|shall we say , 5 o'clock ?
homer simpson|the snacking hour ?
homer simpson|do i know you ?
homer simpson|ow !
homer simpson|why you little ^
homer simpson|oh .
homer simpson|i'll just be another minute , john .

homer simpson|so , do those records have camp value ?
homer simpson|that john is the greatest guy in the world .
homer simpson|we've gotta have him and his wife over for drinks sometime .
homer simpson|oh , a swinging bachelor , eh ?
homer simpson|well , there's lots of foxy ladies out there ^
homer simpson|couldn't agree more .
homer simpson|happy as a clam .
homer simpson|who doesn't ?
homer simpson|right ^
homer simpson|ohmygod !
homer simpson|ohmygod !
homer simpson|ohmygod !
homer simpson|ohmygod !
homer simpson|i danced with a gay !
homer simpson|marge , lisa , promise me you won't tell anyone .
homer simpson|promise me !
homer simpson|am i , marge ?
homer simpson|am i ?
homer simpson|think of the property values !
homer simpson|now we can never say only straight people have been in this house !
homer simpson|whoa , not me .
homer simpson|and not because john's gay , but because he's a sneak .
homer simpson|he should at least have the good taste to mince around and let everyone know that he's that way .
homer simpson|you know me , marge i like my beer cold , my tv loud , and my homosexuals flaming .
homer simpson|no !
homer simpson|no , no , no , no ^
homer simpson|no , no !
homer simpson|i'm not setting foot outside this house until that man is gone !
homer simpson|how'd it go ?
homer simpson|tell me everything that happened !
homer simpson|he didn't give you gay , did he ?
homer simpson|did he ?
homer simpson|oh , and i'm not .
homer simpson|bart !
homer simpson|where'd you get that shirt ?
homer simpson|uhh ^
homer simpson|huh .
homer simpson|marge , the boy was wearing a hawaiian shirt !
homer simpson|there's only two kinds of guys who wear those shirts gay guys , and big fat partyanimals .
homer simpson|and bart doesn't look like a big fat partyanimal to me .
homer simpson|right .
homer simpson|thank you .
homer simpson|i hope you realize this is all your fault .
homer simpson|i mean , do you have to be so effeminate around the boy ?
homer simpson|all right , boy !
homer simpson|come on !
homer simpson|you !
homer simpson|i should have known !
homer simpson|look , john , you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all .
homer simpson|just stay the hell away from my family !
homer simpson|no .
homer simpson|you know .
homer simpson|it's ^
homer simpson|it's not ^
homer simpson|usual !
homer simpson|if there was a law , it would be against it !
homer simpson|no i'm not , marge !
homer simpson|they're embarrassing me !
homer simpson|they're embarrassing america !
homer simpson|they turned the navy into a floating joke !
homer simpson|they ruined all our best names , like bruce and lance and julian !
homer simpson|those were the toughest names we had , now they're just ^
homer simpson|yeah !
homer simpson|and that's another thing !
homer simpson|i resent you people using that word .
homer simpson|that's our word for making fun of you .
homer simpson|we need it !
homer simpson|well , i'm taking back our word and i'm taking back my son !
homer simpson|homer storms out .
homer simpson|don't worry , boy .
homer simpson|we're gonna set you straight .

homer simpson|ohh , my son doesn't stand a chance !

homer simpson|well , this time i'm drunk on love ^
homer simpson|and beer .
homer simpson|oh , why can't they just play through ?
homer simpson|ohh , why are people always trying to kill me ?
homer simpson|marge , can we trade ?
homer simpson|i don't trust these guys .
homer simpson|okay !

homer simpson|yeah , the british tabloids will have a field day .
homer simpson|there's only one thing left to do .
homer simpson|grab onto the handles , marge .
homer simpson|okay , i think i've figured this thing out .
homer simpson|it can go up and down , but not side to side , or back in time .
homer simpson|these have pleats ^
homer simpson|i'm okay , honey .
homer simpson|now listen very carefully .
homer simpson|i want you to pull on the thing that's near the other thing .

homer simpson|why don't you take a picture ?
homer simpson|it lasts longer .
homer simpson|dads especially !
homer simpson|scary ways .
homer simpson|but we never intended it to end like that .
homer simpson|with thousands of people staring at our naked bodies .
homer simpson|who's in the mood for miniature golf ?
homer simpson|can't you just write on your arm like i do ?
homer simpson|yo , apu , gimme the usual .
homer simpson|hey , this hot dog tastes different .
homer simpson|uh , yeah , but without the grease all you can taste is the hog anus .
homer simpson|people buy grease ?
homer simpson|used grease is worth money ?
homer simpson|then my arteries are clogged with yellow gold .
homer simpson|i'm rich , apu !
homer simpson|rich , i !
homer simpson|money in the bank .
homer simpson|okay , this bacon's done .
homer simpson|and now for the profit taking .

homer simpson|marge , if you don't mind , i'm a little busy right now achieving financial independence .
homer simpson|no , through savings and wise investments .
homer simpson|of course with grease !
homer simpson|where do you think you're goin' ?
homer simpson|not for you it isn't .
homer simpson|you're in the grease business now .
homer simpson|okay , boy , this is where all the hard work , sacrifice , and painful scaldings pay off .
homer simpson|woo hoo !
homer simpson|yeah , but your mom paid for that .
homer simpson|and i get my money from grease .
homer simpson|what's the problem ?
homer simpson|wow , look at that load of grease .
homer simpson|boy , if we're ever gonna earn paper money , we have to expand our operation .
homer simpson|oh , you'll miss plenty .
homer simpson|i have a feeling this business is going to consume our whole lives .
homer simpson|lisa , i can't imagine anyone being more likable than you .
homer simpson|but apparently this new girl is .
homer simpson|so my advice would be to start copying her in every way .
homer simpson|uhuh , think .
homer simpson|is that what alex would say ?
homer simpson|oh i'll say .
homer simpson|look at that redheaded kid .
homer simpson|there must be twenty dollars' worth of grease on his forehead alone .
homer simpson|all right .
homer simpson|we'll try it your way .
homer simpson|my god , you're greasy .
homer simpson|if she didn't want her car ruined , she should've done a better job hiding her keys .
homer simpson|hey , what the ^
homer simpson|hey , hey , you're taking our grease !
homer simpson|hey , that's my shovel .
homer simpson|oh , i can't believe those goons muscled me out of my grease business .

homer simpson|oh , what's the point ?
homer simpson|emus ?

homer simpson|oh , that's pretty crazy ^

homer simpson|okay , send the truck .
homer simpson|no , i don't deserve sugar .
homer simpson|i'm halfway to my grave , and i haven't accomplished anything .
homer simpson|oh , i am not looking forward to my funeral .
homer simpson|marge , no matter what happens in the future , promise me you won't vote for lenny .
homer simpson|oh yeah , they'll put me on a stamp for that .
homer simpson|i've wasted half my life , marge .
homer simpson|do you know how many memories i have ?
homer simpson|three !
homer simpson|standing in line for a movie , having a key made , and sitting here talking to you .
homer simpson|thirtyeight years and that's all i have to show for it .
homer simpson|cold .
homer simpson|oh .
homer simpson|i see you're having a party .
homer simpson|i'll come back later .
homer simpson|oh , all right .
homer simpson|maybe i can pinpoint where my life went wrong .
homer simpson|all we did was grow some space tomatoes and sabotage mir .
homer simpson|no .
homer simpson|hike .
homer simpson|oh , i shoulda punted .
homer simpson|turn it off !
homer simpson|turn it off !
homer simpson|stupid movies .
homer simpson|who invented these dumb things anyway ?
homer simpson|was it you , bart ?
homer simpson|no one man can do all that .
homer simpson|you're a liar , honey .
homer simpson|a dirty , rotten liar .
homer simpson|really ?
homer simpson|a restaurant ?
homer simpson|well , now i don't know what to think .
homer simpson|cut it out , boy !
homer simpson|reading about this edison character .
homer simpson|they won't let me in the big people library downtown .
homer simpson|there was some unpleasantness .
homer simpson|i can never go back .
homer simpson|ooh , look at all the inventions edison came up with .
homer simpson|the stock ticker , the storage battery , even wax paper .
homer simpson|and look at him dance .
homer simpson|de de de de de .
homer simpson|and these hardy boys books are great , too .
homer simpson|this one is about smugglers .
homer simpson|no , not this one .
homer simpson|the smugglers of pirate cove .
homer simpson|it's about pirates .
homer simpson|i think it's pretty obvious that i am .
homer simpson|go school !
homer simpson|not the way i quit .
homer simpson|oohwho .
homer simpson|yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , great story , lenny .
homer simpson|but here's one that's even more spellbinding .
homer simpson|once upon a time there was a man named thomas edison .
homer simpson|and he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph ^
homer simpson|and he was a firm believer in fletcherism , and he played the organ , and his favorite flower was the heliotrope oh , and his middle name was alva .
homer simpson|and he never , ever , ever wore pajamas .
homer simpson|and ^
homer simpson|well , i remember where edison worked .
homer simpson|it was menlo park .
homer simpson|that's where he came up with the tasimeter , the ore separator and ^
homer simpson|that's boring .
homer simpson|you're boring everybody .
homer simpson|quit boring everyone !
homer simpson|and then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead .
homer simpson|some kind of scary telephone i guess .
homer simpson|or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell .
homer simpson|ohh , that's where you're wrong , marge .
homer simpson|he was a shameless selfpromoter .
homer simpson|marge , that's it !
homer simpson|that's why i haven't done anything with my life !
homer simpson|i need to be more like thomas edison !
homer simpson|and i'm starting right now .
homer simpson|no more lousy pajamas !
homer simpson|from this day forward , i am an inventor !
homer simpson|well , i quit my job just like you said to .
homer simpson|yes , you did .
homer simpson|i remember your exact words .
homer simpson|you said i should quit my job and become an inventor or you'd torch the house .
homer simpson|at my age edison had already invented 203 things .
homer simpson|ohh , i've got a lot of work to do to catch up to him .
homer simpson|let's see now ^
homer simpson|inventions ^
homer simpson|inventions ^
homer simpson|what ?
homer simpson|eh .
homer simpson|eh .
homer simpson|let me handle the creative end of this , marge .
homer simpson|you don't understand how the creative mind works like i do .
homer simpson|you look at this table and what do you see ?
homer simpson|just a table .
homer simpson|now , a creative person , like me , looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things but no tables .
homer simpson|my files !
homer simpson|uh , this isn't working .
homer simpson|i've got to try a different approach .
homer simpson|yes .
homer simpson|thomas edison smoked several cigars a day .
homer simpson|shutup .
homer simpson|as long as you're here annoying me , let's have a brainstorming session .
homer simpson|now , here's how it works lisa , you say one thing , then bart , you say another .
homer simpson|just toss out things and i'll use my inventive mind to combine them into a brilliant original idea .
homer simpson|okay .
homer simpson|uhhuh .
homer simpson|a wait a minute !
homer simpson|these aren't exciting new products !
homer simpson|you're not even trying .
homer simpson|okay , that's it .
homer simpson|both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves .
homer simpson|i don't see why not .
homer simpson|they're my kids .
homer simpson|i own 'em .
homer simpson|okay , we own 'em .
homer simpson|ohhh , it's no use .
homer simpson|i can't work like this , cut off from the scientific community .
homer simpson|you stay here and guard the sandwich .
homer simpson|look , i just want to know how to invent things .
homer simpson|tell me .
homer simpson|you mean like an electric blanketmobile ?
homer simpson|hamburger earmuffs !
homer simpson|thanks , sucker !
homer simpson|okay , i have here the four greatest inventions in the history of mankind .
homer simpson|first , my allpurpose electric hammer .
homer simpson|for all your pounding needs .
homer simpson|ow !
homer simpson|probably needs to be more powerful .
homer simpson|now , here's my everything's okay alarm .
homer simpson|this will sound every three seconds unless something isn't okay .
homer simpson|it can't be turned off .
homer simpson|but it does break easily .
homer simpson|now this next one's for the ladies .
homer simpson|how many times have you gals been late for a highpowered business meeting , only to realize you're not wearing makeup ?
homer simpson|that's why i invented this revolutionary makeup gun .
homer simpson|it's for the woman who only has fourfifths of a second to get ready .
homer simpson|close your eyes , marge .
homer simpson|and now you're ready for a night on the town .
homer simpson|eh .
homer simpson|oh .
homer simpson|okay , this time try to keep your nostrils closed .
homer simpson|oh , look what you did .
homer simpson|now i have to get my cold cream gun .
homer simpson|women will like what i tell them to like .
homer simpson|now here's something for everyone .
homer simpson|in the olden times , if you were watching tv and nature called , you'd have to get up and walk to the bathroom .
homer simpson|it was the hardest thing in the world to do .
homer simpson|but now , with the lazy man reclining toilet chair , you can just lean back and let 'er rip .
homer simpson|sure !
homer simpson|believe me , every man in america will want to have one .
homer simpson|yes ?
homer simpson|yes ?
homer simpson|yes ?
homer simpson|yes ?
homer simpson|what ?
homer simpson|but this is the best i could do .
homer simpson|i guess i'm no better at being thomas edison than i was at being homer simpson .
homer simpson|all week , my life long dream was to be the next thomas edison , but now it's over .
homer simpson|i guess i'll just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father .
homer simpson|oh , that .
homer simpson|i stuck a couple of extra legs on there 'cause i kept tipping over when i was trying to invent stuff .
homer simpson|really ?
homer simpson|you think it's a good idea ?
homer simpson|i did it !
homer simpson|i'm gonna be rich !
homer simpson|look , mr edison , i did it .
homer simpson|i'm an inventor !
homer simpson|and i owe it all to you .
homer simpson|see ?
homer simpson|it's just a regular chair , but i attached a couple of extra legs to the back ^
homer simpson|kinda like the ones on the back of your ^
homer simpson|awdammit !
homer simpson|i thought i had a great idea , but i must've seen it on this poster .
homer simpson|it's not ?
homer simpson|maybe he never told anyone about it .
homer simpson|that chair might be the only one he made .
homer simpson|so , we've got to go to the edison museum and smash it !
homer simpson|then i'll be an inventor !
homer simpson|aw , to hell with him !
homer simpson|takingbartacrossstatelinesbacksoon .
homer simpson|i borrowed your wallet !
homer simpson|oh , son , you're young and headstrong , just like thomas edison , jr .
homer simpson|you know , he started a mushroom farm , and an auto parts company , and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company .
homer simpson|oh , and later , he raised turkeys .
homer simpson|that was on his turkey farm .
homer simpson|now let's take care of business .
homer simpson|outta the way .
homer simpson|this is one invention you're not getting credit for , you inspiration hog !
homer simpson|invent your way out of this , edison .
homer simpson|look , son .
homer simpson|edison was just like me .
homer simpson|no !
homer simpson|we both lived in another man's shadow .
homer simpson|this oldtimey nerd and i have suffered the same frustration and heartache .
homer simpson|we're not rivals .
homer simpson|we're just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high .
homer simpson|i can't destroy your work , my friend .
homer simpson|no , but we'll stop off at the da vinci museum on the way home ^
homer simpson|oh .
homer simpson|well then , we'll take it out on eli whitney .
homer simpson|yay !
homer simpson|/ all right !
homer simpson|/ woohoo !
homer simpson|that's my tommy .

homer simpson|that's a story for another day .
homer simpson|i realized i could never find the gold without your help .

homer simpson|and now i'm using sarcasm to confess the whole thing , so later i can say that i already told you .
homer simpson|oh , you're so right .
homer simpson|i guess i should be more concerned with bart's safety than covering my own butt .
homer simpson|and maybe i'm talking like this because i can't stop .
homer simpson|help me , lisa !
homer simpson|i have serious mental problems !
homer simpson|bart !
homer simpson|bart !
homer simpson|when the monkey falls asleep , i'll sneak you out in this trash bag .

homer simpson|for the love of god , make sure the party boat has a moonbounce .
homer simpson|and when you pushed me off the bridge , it's 'cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure i got here .

homer simpson|things happened between your mother and me that we're not proud of .
homer simpson|it was the middle of a wild decade known as the nineteen nineties .
homer simpson|oh , it was a wonderful time .
homer simpson|the iraq war was over once and for all , a struggling matt groening created futurama , and young people believed in their dreams , thanks to a tv show called melrose place ^
homer simpson|your mother and i were dating and we had just moved into our first apartment together .
homer simpson|we didn't have a lot of money , but we were young and in love .
homer simpson|like all young people , i had a musical dream .
homer simpson|a dream called inoffensive urban light hiphop smooth grooves .
homer simpson|but marge's education was worth all the pistol whipping in the world .
homer simpson|marge !
homer simpson|marge !
homer simpson|where are you ?
homer simpson|i was so depressed , i spent all my time in a bar .
homer simpson|i had finally realized every rock star's dream ^
homer simpson|hating being famous .
homer simpson|a tale of two young outlaws in love ^
homer simpson|i had become diabetic from drinking too many frappuccinos .
homer simpson|with the nineties drawing to a close , and the sydney olympics to look forward to , our love rekindled ^
homer simpson|and one moonlit night , i finally had fun at a minigolf course .
homer simpson|yep , that professor couldn't keep me and marge apart .
homer simpson|i mean , unless he had been a little nicer at the beach .
homer simpson|and once we were back together , i was too happy ever to grunge again .
homer simpson|good , 'cause i'm parking at it right now .

homer simpson|one moment .
homer simpson|you'd think so , but ^
homer simpson|they were the bonnie and clyde of their day .
homer simpson|their names were ^
homer simpson|bonnie and clyde .
homer simpson|even love is boring when you're stuck in a tunnel of it .
homer simpson|why can't this be the tunnel of hockey fights ?
homer simpson|happy valentine's day , and shut your gob .
homer simpson|loa ^
homer simpson|ner ?
homer simpson|wow .

marge simpson|homer !

marge simpson|when i was young , i always hated knowing my parents were fighting .
marge simpson|homer , do you remember the way you acted at the party last night ?
marge simpson|homer , i like to think that i'm a patient , tolerant woman , and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you .
marge simpson|but last night , you didn't just cross that line , you threw up on it !
marge simpson|i'm going to church alone today .
marge simpson|you're going to stay here and explain to bart why you scarred him for life .
marge simpson|we'll be there !
marge simpson|we're going to this retreat to give our marriage a tuneup and that's all .

marge simpson|hello , reverend .
marge simpson|we're glad we could come .
marge simpson|oh , hello helen .
marge simpson|oh , homer .
marge simpson|well , it's not that i don't love the guy .
marge simpson|i'm always sticking up for him .
marge simpson|it's just that he's so selfcentered .
marge simpson|he forgets birthdays , anniversaries , holidays both religious and secular he chews with his mouth open , he gambles , he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes ^
marge simpson|he blows his nose on the towels , and puts them back in the middle ^
marge simpson|he drinks out of the carton .
marge simpson|he never changes the baby .
marge simpson|when he goes to sleep , he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises .
marge simpson|oh ^
marge simpson|oh ^
marge simpson|and he scratches himself with his keys .
marge simpson|i guess that's it .
marge simpson|oh no .
marge simpson|wait .
marge simpson|he kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow .
marge simpson|that's all i can think of right now .
marge simpson|i guess you're all tired and i want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest .
marge simpson|homer , you're sneaking out to go fishing ?
marge simpson|i can't believe your selfishness .
marge simpson|you can go fishing anytime , but we're here trying to save our marriage .
marge simpson|you're thinking about fishing , even when i'm talking ^
marge simpson|right now .
marge simpson|right ?
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|get back in bed .
marge simpson|sure .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|do i have to do this ?
marge simpson|we came to this retreat because i thought our marriage was in trouble , but i never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble .
marge simpson|homer , how can you expect me to believe ^
marge simpson|to who ?
marge simpson|all this fish represents is just how selfish you are .
marge simpson|oh yeah , sure .
marge simpson|ohhh , homer .
marge simpson|oh my , the house looks wonderful .
marge simpson|grampa , what's your secret ?
marge simpson|kids , could you lighten up a little ?
marge simpson|we're here !
marge simpson|so , did you kids have fun ?
marge simpson|ohhh .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|don't gloat , homer .
marge simpson|you know , bart , when i was your age , the one thing i wanted more than anything in the world was a childsized electric lightbulb oven .
marge simpson|my parents wouldn't give me the money , so i went to my sisters , patty and selma ^
marge simpson|for months , i worked and worked , while my sisters smoked and smoked ^
marge simpson|but the big day finally came .
marge simpson|and because i'd worked for it , all those lightbulbwarmed treats always tasted extragood .
marge simpson|so maybe a parttime job is the answer .
marge simpson|the poor boy is so desperate .
marge simpson|he wants to earn money to buy a comic book .
marge simpson|i don't think so .
marge simpson|did you make any money ?
marge simpson|well , i think what you're doing for mrs glick is very nice .
marge simpson|the poor old thing doesn't have anybody .
marge simpson|i thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s'mores .
marge simpson|homer , it's really coming down .
marge simpson|could you check on the boys ?
marge simpson|boys , you better come in the house .
marge simpson|you don't want to get the sniffles .
marge simpson|now come on ^
marge simpson|you can play your little tieup game inside .
marge simpson|i've got some cocoa on the stove .
marge simpson|who wants imitation marshmallows ?
marge simpson|what are you doing , honey ?
marge simpson|lisa , we did the best we could ^
marge simpson|what's a zebu ?
marge simpson|apositive .
marge simpson|a mother knows everything about her family .
marge simpson|four b .
marge simpson|sixteen permanent , eight baby .
marge simpson|xl .
marge simpson|i don't want you wearing rings , it looks cheap , but three .
marge simpson|butterscotch and imitation butterscotch .
marge simpson|glow in the dark monster makeup .
marge simpson|oh , homie , you have lots of hair ^
marge simpson|why did you want to know your blood type ?
marge simpson|bart does .
marge simpson|bart , you have to help someone in need .
marge simpson|it's the only decent thing to do .
marge simpson|the meaning of what ?
marge simpson|homer , you don't do things like that to be rewarded .
marge simpson|you do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand .
marge simpson|we got exactly what we wanted out of this we gave an old man a second chance .
marge simpson|but he's your boss .
marge simpson|do you have to mail it right this minute ?
marge simpson|you're still angry , homer .
marge simpson|why don't you sleep on it ?
marge simpson|please , homie ?
marge simpson|for me ?
marge simpson|homer ^
marge simpson|breakfast is ready .
marge simpson|oh ^
marge simpson|thank you .
marge simpson|homer , i don't think it's in the cornstarch canister .
marge simpson|homer , you encouraged him .
marge simpson|you should be strangling yourself .
marge simpson|honey , what's done is done .
marge simpson|no matter what happens , we'll pull through .
marge simpson|we always do .
marge simpson|oh , my !
marge simpson|it's mr burns .
marge simpson|it doesn't do anything .
marge simpson|whatever it does , it's doing it now .
marge simpson|homer , it's the thought that counts .
marge simpson|the moral of this story is , a good deed is its own reward .
marge simpson|well then , i guess the moral is , no good deed goes unrewarded .
marge simpson|well ^
marge simpson|then i guess the moral is , the squeaky wheel gets the grease .
marge simpson|but it certainly was a memorable few days !
marge simpson|bart , watch maggie while i get the laundry .
marge simpson|maggie !
marge simpson|bart , i asked you to watch your sister !
marge simpson|i washed it .
marge simpson|now homer , don't panic .
marge simpson|you have plenty of white shirts .
marge simpson|i don't know how this could have happened .
marge simpson|homer , please .
marge simpson|no one's going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work .
marge simpson|homer , this is an intimate psychological profile .
marge simpson|i can't fill this out for you .
marge simpson|oh my god !
marge simpson|mother was right .
marge simpson|i told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house .
marge simpson|i said crazy house !
marge simpson|crazy house !
marge simpson|crazy house !
marge simpson|doctor , if you just talked to him for five minutes without mentioning our son , bart , you'd see how sane he is .
marge simpson|oh , homie .
marge simpson|well , at least we got a free sample of reading digest .
marge simpson|no , it is not the truth , homer .
marge simpson|it's well documented that women are safer drivers than men .
marge simpson|you've certainly taken a shine to that magazine .
marge simpson|homer , he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article .
marge simpson|homie ^
marge simpson|put down your magazine for a minute ^
marge simpson|i thought you might want to snuggle .
marge simpson|thank you , homie .
marge simpson|it certainly has enriched our lives .
marge simpson|bart , maybe this is something you'd like to do , too .
marge simpson|how's it going , honey ?
marge simpson|well , when i used to get stuck like this , i'd go for a bike ride .
marge simpson|do kids go on bike rides anymore ?
marge simpson|i don't know , i thought maybe bikes weren't cool anymore .
marge simpson|do kids still use that word , cool ?
marge simpson|oooh , look , homer .
marge simpson|the irs .
marge simpson|here we are , kids !
marge simpson|the watergate .
marge simpson|homer , look !
marge simpson|they give you a shower cap , and body gel and bathrobes ^
marge simpson|ooh , and a welcoming mint on your pillow .
marge simpson|wow , the president's bathroom !
marge simpson|lisa , the contest isn't for three hours .
marge simpson|i know , honey , but just sit still .
marge simpson|lisa , what's gotten into you ?
marge simpson|imprisoned congressman becomes bornagain christian .
marge simpson|no , that was about the budget gap .
marge simpson|this is the trading gap .
marge simpson|i think it means he's having a barbecue .
marge simpson|he's trying to be friendly .
marge simpson|oh , homer .
marge simpson|hi , ned .
marge simpson|homer sends his apologies , but uh ^
marge simpson|there was some important work at the plant that only he could take care of .
marge simpson|bart , how many hours a day do you watch tv ?
marge simpson|don't you think you should get a little fresh air and maybe some exercise ?
marge simpson|that's the problem .
marge simpson|even as we speak , millions of children are staring at the tv instead of getting some muchneeded exercise .
marge simpson|those children's parents should be ashamed of themselves .
marge simpson|that sounds fine , bart .
marge simpson|so bart , what did you learn in karate school today ?
marge simpson|bart , don't use the touch of death on your sister .
marge simpson|homer , this is the flanders' entire living room set .
marge simpson|how much did you pay for this ?
marge simpson|seventyfive dollars ?
marge simpson|ned must be desperate !
marge simpson|you got a job ?
marge simpson|doing what ?
marge simpson|bart , your father and i don't want you doing that .
marge simpson|homer , say something .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|i know it's good for a boy to have a parttime job , but i'm not sure about the people bart's working for .
marge simpson|i thinks they're criminals .
marge simpson|well , bart's been acting very strangely .
marge simpson|and that pizza delivery truck has been parked across the street for two weeks .
marge simpson|how long does it take to deliver a pizza ?
marge simpson|homer , i want you to go down to that club and talk to them .
marge simpson|just see what kind of people they are .
marge simpson|please , homie ?
marge simpson|homer , what did you find out ?
marge simpson|oh , bart .
marge simpson|why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys .
marge simpson|principal skinner !
marge simpson|well , they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us .
marge simpson|oh my lord !
marge simpson|homie , please be all right .
marge simpson|dear lord , if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground , i'll try to be a better christian .
marge simpson|i don't know what i can do ^
marge simpson|ummm , oooh , the next time there's a canned food drive i'll give the poor something they'd actually like instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix .
marge simpson|homer , did you go out and buy a twenty pound ham ?
marge simpson|and what's all this ?
marge simpson|for heroic competence ^
marge simpson|for narrowly averting a meltdown and proving , without question , that nuclear power is completely safe ^
marge simpson|employeeofthemonth !
marge simpson|ohh , homer !
marge simpson|how are you enjoying your ham , homie ?
marge simpson|bart , don't feed your sister hotels !
marge simpson|i think that game is too old for her .
marge simpson|why don't you go play with milhouse ?
marge simpson|you mean you still haven't made up with him ?
marge simpson|mrs van houten , i'm bart's mother we met in the emergency room when the boys drank paint .
marge simpson|look , i know bart can be a handful but i also know what he's like inside .
marge simpson|he's got a spark .
marge simpson|it's not a bad thing ^
marge simpson|of course it makes him do bad things ^
marge simpson|well , i can't defend everything he does .
marge simpson|but let's face it , all bart and milhouse have is each other .
marge simpson|they're too young for girls .
marge simpson|and they're a popular target for bullies .
marge simpson|and in the christmas pageant , they're always sheep .
marge simpson|please , please , let them be friends !
marge simpson|well , i knew his mother would come to her senses .
marge simpson|what makes you think i did it ?
marge simpson|you be good .
marge simpson|hello ?
marge simpson|oh hello , mrs pennycandy .
marge simpson|oh , dear .
marge simpson|this is the fifth time he's cancelled .
marge simpson|how can he hurt someone who loves him so ?
marge simpson|well , thank you for calling .
marge simpson|goodbye .
marge simpson|sweetie , i'm sorry , but krusty isn't coming to dinner again .
marge simpson|bart , wipe your feet .
marge simpson|i've got some good news .
marge simpson|krusty the clown is coming to dinner tonight .
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|who wants to say grace ?
marge simpson|krusty , why don't you tell us what's wrong ?
marge simpson|you'll feel better .
marge simpson|well , look at the time .
marge simpson|almost midnight .
marge simpson|homer , maybe you better take milhouse home .
marge simpson|we're home !
marge simpson|now children , you can have one piece of candy tonight and save the rest for ^
marge simpson|if you eat too much you'll have nightmares .
marge simpson|look everybody !
marge simpson|my purse exploded !
marge simpson|ugghh , homer .
marge simpson|where did you get that ugly thing ?
marge simpson|homer , there's something i don't like about that severed hand .
marge simpson|oh , my land !
marge simpson|ooh , a new pacifier .
marge simpson|homer , maybe fame and fortune aren't as bad as they say .
marge simpson|oh homer , this is awful .
marge simpson|good morning , dear .
marge simpson|much better !
marge simpson|oh good , the curtains are on fire !
marge simpson|now hadn't you better get ready for school ?
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|that's it , young man .
marge simpson|you're coming with me ^
marge simpson|please ?
marge simpson|my goodness , what's wrong ?
marge simpson|it's your father , he's missing .
marge simpson|he's been gone for two days .
marge simpson|did you have a nightmare , homie ?
marge simpson|don't worry , honey , i'm sure your father is ^
marge simpson|maybe .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|that's a long shot .
marge simpson|bingo .
marge simpson|don't worry , he'll be here .
marge simpson|look homer , lisa's taking her first steps .
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|did you hear that , homer ?
marge simpson|homer , if you want to make up with lisa just spend some time with her .
marge simpson|homie , you've got to stop looking for the quick fix .
marge simpson|if you keep spending time with lisa , she'll forgive you .
marge simpson|we can't afford to buy a pony .
marge simpson|that's ridiculous .
marge simpson|that's no reason to buy a pony !
marge simpson|stick to the subject .
marge simpson|let's be realistic .
marge simpson|a pony is very expensive and we have enough trouble paying bills as it is .
marge simpson|you sound like you're going to buy a pony .
marge simpson|promise me you won't .
marge simpson|what was that ?
marge simpson|was that a yes or a no ?
marge simpson|those aren't even words !
marge simpson|i am very upset with you .
marge simpson|homer , just where were you planning to keep this horse ?
marge simpson|that's illegal .
marge simpson|hmm , oh dear , we're in serious trouble here .
marge simpson|we're just going to have to cut down on luxuries .
marge simpson|actually , i was thinking we could cut down on your beer .
marge simpson|then i'm afraid there's no choice but to give up the pony back .
marge simpson|homer ^
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|you got us into this , you get us out .
marge simpson|homer , where have you been ?
marge simpson|i was so worried .
marge simpson|homie , how long do you plan to do this ?
marge simpson|thirty years ?
marge simpson|he's just exhausted .
marge simpson|lisa , do you know how much it costs to keep a pony ?
marge simpson|well , it's a lot .
marge simpson|in fact , your father had to take a second job .
marge simpson|the kwikemart .
marge simpson|lisa , i hope you realize that your father can't keep this up .
marge simpson|lisa , we can't make you give up that pony .
marge simpson|no , bart .
marge simpson|no one's going to make her .
marge simpson|this is something lisa has to decide for herself .
marge simpson|homer , can you get the door ?
marge simpson|it's my sisters .
marge simpson|homer , be nice .
marge simpson|what's the matter , can't you find a hair style you like ?
marge simpson|ed asner ?
marge simpson|homer , are you ordering junk off the tv again ?
marge simpson|who's using the power tools ?
marge simpson|well , we're going to the beauty parlor .
marge simpson|maybe you should do something with the kids while i'm gone .
marge simpson|i don't know .
marge simpson|homie , we're back .
marge simpson|homer , could you turn off the tv ?
marge simpson|there's a little test i want you to take .
marge simpson|this is from the national fatherhood institute .
marge simpson|it evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father .
marge simpson|question one name one of your child's friends ^
marge simpson|they want a name , homer , not a vague description .
marge simpson|hank ?
marge simpson|hank who ?
marge simpson|homer , you made that up .
marge simpson|question two who is your son's hero ?
marge simpson|that's your hero .
marge simpson|name another dad you talked to about parenting .
marge simpson|what are your son's hobbies ?
marge simpson|he hasn't done that since he was two .
marge simpson|oh really ?
marge simpson|well , maybe you should go out in the garage and see .
marge simpson|now , don't pout .
marge simpson|don't you at least have something to say to bart ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|i've always said you were a good father .
marge simpson|i've always defended you when people put you down .
marge simpson|but i guess i was wrong .
marge simpson|you are a bad father .
marge simpson|bart , you know there is such a thing as being a bad winner .
marge simpson|honey , what's wrong ?
marge simpson|homie , why don't you just go down to moe's and talk to him ?
marge simpson|i bet he'd be willing to share some of his success with you .
marge simpson|so , mr hutz , does my husband have a case ?
marge simpson|well homer , maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy .
marge simpson|well , duh .
marge simpson|bart , are you going to moe the lawn today ?
marge simpson|i moe , i moe .
marge simpson|of course .
marge simpson|all work and moe play makes moe a moe moe .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|turn to the financial channel !
marge simpson|aunt patty says our stock is skyrocketing !
marge simpson|your father's stock is worth fiftytwo hundred dollars !
marge simpson|it's the miracle we've been waiting for .
marge simpson|we'll have a savings account .
marge simpson|we've never had one .
marge simpson|kids , i think everything is going to be okay from now on .
marge simpson|oh , homer !
marge simpson|we heard !
marge simpson|isn't it wonderful ?
marge simpson|we have some great plans for that money .
marge simpson|what do you mean ?
marge simpson|you spent fiftytwo hundred dollars on beer ?
marge simpson|look at all those worried faces except for lenny .
marge simpson|he looks great .
marge simpson|homie , come to bed .
marge simpson|don't worry .
marge simpson|whatever happens , we'll pay the bills somehow .
marge simpson|well , if you can't sleep , why don't you do something constructive ?
marge simpson|now , bart , lisa did a wonderful job on my hair and we saved forty dollars for the family .
marge simpson|we all have to pull together 'til your father gets a new job .
marge simpson|that's very clever .
marge simpson|hmmm , you shouldn't do that .
marge simpson|that's good , lisa .
marge simpson|i want you to take baths , bart .
marge simpson|bart , i want you to go down to moe's tavern .
marge simpson|i need you to bring your father home .
marge simpson|barnacle bill's home pregnancy test ?
marge simpson|homer , shouldn't we have gone with a betterknown brand ?

marge simpson|hmmm , what do you think about ?
marge simpson|it's homer !
marge simpson|you don't know homer like i do .
marge simpson|he's sensitive and sweet .
marge simpson|homer , do you ever think about the future ?
marge simpson|no , i mean how you plan to earn a living .
marge simpson|i can't imagine that job of yours is very stimulating .
marge simpson|i think about you , too .
marge simpson|oh , homer .
marge simpson|you light up my days / and fill my nights / with song ^
marge simpson|our song .
marge simpson|actually , she was singing about god .
marge simpson|you don't have to do that .
marge simpson|homer , maybe it's the champale talking , but i think you're pretty sexy .
marge simpson|what if we get caught ?
marge simpson|i need you to drive me to the doctor , homer .
marge simpson|well , that unforgettable night we ^
marge simpson|joined the castle club ^
marge simpson|so you've ruined your life .
marge simpson|well , i haven't said no to you lately , have i ?

marge simpson|oh , homer , this is the most beautiful moment of my life !

marge simpson|marge .

marge simpson|homer , i don't know how we can afford all these things on your salary .

marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|be polite .
marge simpson|wha'd you say ?
marge simpson|i can't understand you with all that distortion .

marge simpson|testing ^
marge simpson|testing ^

marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|sting , you look tired .
marge simpson|maybe you should take a rest .
marge simpson|oh bart , i've missed you so much .
marge simpson|homer , all those fatty , deepfried , heavily salted snacks can't be good for your heart .
marge simpson|oh , look at that , a shoe box house .
marge simpson|lisa , you're so clever .
marge simpson|well ^
marge simpson|do you ever take an interest in anything he does ?
marge simpson|hmmm , well , if you want to get closer to him then maybe you should bridge the gap .
marge simpson|i do it all the time .
marge simpson|i pretend i'm interested in looking at power tools , going to those silly car chase movies , and ^
marge simpson|some things i'll tell you about when you're older .
marge simpson|do you understand ?
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|bart ?
marge simpson|i was thinking that while your father and lisa watch the game , it might be fun if the two of us went clothes shopping .
marge simpson|oh really ?
marge simpson|hmm ^
marge simpson|now bart , i think you'd look very sharp in this shirt .
marge simpson|no , no , no , you have to try it on .

marge simpson|well , we had fun too .
marge simpson|right now , bart is modeling his new clothes for his friends .
marge simpson|look at these prices .
marge simpson|we could finally get rid of those termites for the cost of this meal .
marge simpson|homer , i can't help wondering where you're getting the money from ?
marge simpson|hmm , i guess so .
marge simpson|ooh , perfume .
marge simpson|meryl streep's versatility .
marge simpson|homer , those are very thoughtful presents .
marge simpson|but you have to tell me where you got the money from .

marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|i did not !
marge simpson|i promised i would get mad !
marge simpson|she's an eightyearold girl .
marge simpson|but gambling is illegal .
marge simpson|well , i just don't know .
marge simpson|you're a very selfish man .
marge simpson|homer , i think that chip's got enough dip on it .
marge simpson|i am not cleaning that ^
marge simpson|ah , who am i kidding ?
marge simpson|now maggie , when you grow up you can suck your pacifier all you want .

marge simpson|and from now on i hope you'll help me out a little more than you're used to .
marge simpson|well , i could use a little more .
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|name me one person who's gotten rich by doing yoyo tricks .
marge simpson|maybe we should let the dog in ?
marge simpson|i think he needs a dog house .
marge simpson|i'll bet we could buy a nice doghouse for fifty dollars .
marge simpson|i am not !
marge simpson|oh , i don't know ^
marge simpson|how was detention today , dear ?
marge simpson|of course i saved them .
marge simpson|although actually there's only one .
marge simpson|and it's more of a love postcard , from some brewery he visited .
marge simpson|well , you know , maybe he's right .
marge simpson|actually , homer , you brought up ned flanders .
marge simpson|no , you're not .
marge simpson|when my father got out of the navy , he used to curse a blue streak .
marge simpson|it almost cost him his job as a baby photographer .
marge simpson|so , my mom put a swear jar in the kitchen .
marge simpson|every time he said a bad word , he put in a quarter .
marge simpson|what do you think ?
marge simpson|yes , homer .
marge simpson|no , homer .
marge simpson|yes , homer .
marge simpson|uh ^
marge simpson|that's okay .
marge simpson|there was more than enough in the swear jar .
marge simpson|and if you look inside the doghouse , there's a little surprise .
marge simpson|no , behind her .
marge simpson|where's maggie ?
marge simpson|where's maggie ?
marge simpson|there's maggie !
marge simpson|oh , my special little guy has a sweetheart .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|bart , you did a very cruel thing .
marge simpson|no , homer .
marge simpson|the truth would humiliate her .
marge simpson|we'll all help .
marge simpson|that's disgusting .
marge simpson|and besides , when a woman loves a man , it doesn't matter that a crocodile bit off his face .
marge simpson|homer , for the last time , i am not putting that in .
marge simpson|oh , that's very good , lisa .
marge simpson|how shall we end it ?
marge simpson|oh , that's sweet .
marge simpson|homie , come to bed .
marge simpson|homer , go back to the garage .
marge simpson|and the next man wants to hit the ball too .
marge simpson|and he does .
marge simpson|and there he goes off in that direction .
marge simpson|and everyone is happy .
marge simpson|that's all right dear .
marge simpson|i can do it .
marge simpson|you hit so many home runs this year .
marge simpson|what makes you think this darryl strawberry character is better than you ?
marge simpson|oh , homie .
marge simpson|you're good at lots of things .
marge simpson|like snuggling ^
marge simpson|children , that's not very nice .
marge simpson|oh , dear .
marge simpson|children , tell me when your father stops scratching himself .
marge simpson|kids ?
marge simpson|oh , dear .
marge simpson|ohh , well , i guess he'll be happy when he comes to .
marge simpson|lisa , it's not that bad .
marge simpson|that's nice , bart .
marge simpson|you know your father wanted to be a policeman for a little while .
marge simpson|but they said he was too heavy .
marge simpson|honey , if that's what you want , we'll do anything we can to help .
marge simpson|so you think she has talent ?
marge simpson|do you think she could be a professional some day ?
marge simpson|morning , honey .
marge simpson|lisa , i know you're down on homemaking , but it can really let you be creative .
marge simpson|see , this morning i turned bacon , eggs and toast into a nice smiley face for bart and homer .
marge simpson|oh well , you'd be surprised .
marge simpson|bad dog !
marge simpson|very bad dog .
marge simpson|oh ^
marge simpson|oh ^
marge simpson|unng ^
marge simpson|oh , bart .
marge simpson|lisa , why aren't you at band practice ?
marge simpson|oh , honey , right now you're discouraged .
marge simpson|but deep down , you know you love the saxophone .
marge simpson|i think you should stay in the band .
marge simpson|lisa , there are a lot of people in the world who like to tell you what you can't do .
marge simpson|but they don't always know what they're talking about .
marge simpson|so you see , my sisters were wrong .
marge simpson|except about the cities on the moon .
marge simpson|i was wrong about that .
marge simpson|so ^
marge simpson|well , you can see how anyone can be wrong .
marge simpson|bart's grades are up a little this term .
marge simpson|but lisa's are way down .
marge simpson|we have three kids , homer .
marge simpson|no , maggie !
marge simpson|but we never ever ^
marge simpson|i buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon .
marge simpson|we each play our birthday .
marge simpson|and that's enough excitement for me .
marge simpson|homer , we're on a tight budget here .
marge simpson|promise me you won't get carried away .
marge simpson|you can still win some money if you have five out of six .
marge simpson|homer , the odds are three hundred and eighty million to one .
marge simpson|oh well ^
marge simpson|we lost the money , but at least we've still got each other .
marge simpson|well , he's not dead , but he is awfully sick .
marge simpson|hmm , how much will it cost ?
marge simpson|oh dear !
marge simpson|oh , honey .
marge simpson|sevenhundred and fifty dollars is a lot of money .
marge simpson|we really can't afford this operation .
marge simpson|bart , watch your language .
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|you did .
marge simpson|sorry .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|you are not going to perform that operation yourself .
marge simpson|i've found a way we can pay for the operation .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i'm afraid we're just going to have to make a few sacrifices .
marge simpson|homer , you're going to have to give up beer for a while .
marge simpson|bart , from now on you'll have to get your hair cut for free at springfield barber college .
marge simpson|i'm going to give up buying my weekly lottery ticket , and i found a way to stretch the food budget .
marge simpson|fried chicken night will now be organ meat night .
marge simpson|ham night will be spam night .
marge simpson|and porkchop night ^
marge simpson|will now be chub night .
marge simpson|lisa , i'm afraid we'll have to stop getting you those volumes of encyclopedia generica from the grocery store .
marge simpson|we all have to make sacrifices , dear .
marge simpson|maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer ^
marge simpson|i don't think you've thought this through .
marge simpson|you wouldn't want what he's eating .
marge simpson|it's mostly just snouts and entrails .
marge simpson|what's that ?
marge simpson|oh no !
marge simpson|those are my numbers !
marge simpson|if it wasn't for that dog , i would've won !
marge simpson|not now .
marge simpson|homie , did you close the gate ?
marge simpson|the dog will get out !
marge simpson|here boy !
marge simpson|not one that i want the public to see .
marge simpson|homer get ahold of yourself .
marge simpson|even if he has passed on , there's no reason to cry .
marge simpson|remember doggie heaven .
marge simpson|you can pet the cat .
marge simpson|oh , there's a spot , dear .
marge simpson|that spot says compact only .
marge simpson|so , what are we going to see ?
marge simpson|well , since we'll never agree , why don't you kids pick a movie , your dad and i will pick a movie , then we'll all meet in the lobby later .
marge simpson|hmm ?
marge simpson|maybe we could see something a little more adult .
marge simpson|ooh !
marge simpson|the paper called it a taut political thriller .
marge simpson|well of course he's a spy .
marge simpson|you just saw him go through spy school !
marge simpson|oh , shut up , homer !
marge simpson|no one wants to hear what you think !
marge simpson|homer , if it makes you feel any better , most of what they threw at you splattered on me .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homie , aren't you coming inside ?
marge simpson|where were you all night ?
marge simpson|you should have called .
marge simpson|i was very worried .
marge simpson|well , it's nice .
marge simpson|but who is this woman ?
marge simpson|i don't like you hanging around with some cocktail waitress !
marge simpson|i don't want to .
marge simpson|i'm mad at you .
marge simpson|i'm sick of that waitress and all the time you've been spending with her , and this whole country music thing .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|where did you get that suit ?
marge simpson|was it lurleen ?
marge simpson|don't lie to me .
marge simpson|are you having an affair with this woman ?
marge simpson|have you kissed her ?
marge simpson|has she kissed you ?
marge simpson|i want you to stop seeing her .
marge simpson|her manager ?
marge simpson|that's ridiculous .
marge simpson|i won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family .
marge simpson|your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie .
marge simpson|and you did it at the county fair last year .
marge simpson|remember ?
marge simpson|fine .
marge simpson|see if i care .
marge simpson|homer , how much did you just give that man ?
marge simpson|mrs homer simpson .
marge simpson|hmmm .
marge simpson|i thought you said she was overweight !
marge simpson|what does that mean ?
marge simpson|all our money's tied up in this woman .
marge simpson|if she fails , we're broke .
marge simpson|if she succeeds , i have no husband .
marge simpson|i don't know what to root for .
marge simpson|i gotta go .
marge simpson|homer ^
marge simpson|just so you know , while you and lurleen were out judging that greased pig contest , maggie cut her first tooth .
marge simpson|you're not even listening to me !
marge simpson|kids , will you come in here ?
marge simpson|you've got a wonderful family , homer .

marge simpson|now , now , he's an exconvict .
marge simpson|he's paid his debt to society .
marge simpson|i'm just not .

marge simpson|now remember everyone , be understanding and forgiving for the sake of family unity .
marge simpson|selma , i've never seen you so happy .

marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|stop that .
marge simpson|oooh , there's krusty the clown !
marge simpson|krusty , krusty , say something funny .
marge simpson|because he wants his honeymoon to be romantic .
marge simpson|i guess you're just too young to understand .
marge simpson|go ahead , patty .
marge simpson|well , he fooled almost everyone .
marge simpson|but there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust .
marge simpson|my little guy's first rock concert .
marge simpson|i hope the spinal taps don't play too loud .
marge simpson|hmmm , well , all right , but make sure they don't pick up any of the band's attitudes towards women ^
marge simpson|liquor ^
marge simpson|religion ^
marge simpson|politics ^
marge simpson|really anything .
marge simpson|hmmm , i hope my poor little baby's okay .
marge simpson|oh , oh ^
marge simpson|thank god !
marge simpson|we'll discuss it later .
marge simpson|is milhouse okay ?
marge simpson|homer , i've been thinking about what bart said .
marge simpson|if he's really interested in being a musician , maybe we should buy him a guitar .
marge simpson|i meant a real guitar .
marge simpson|and it came with a free instruction book .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|bart , what's going on ?
marge simpson|what conversation ?
marge simpson|that's not my voice !
marge simpson|i don't understand this .
marge simpson|why can't you stay with your parents ?
marge simpson|i know we didn't ask for this , homer , but doesn't the bible say , whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers , that you do unto me ^
marge simpson|otto , you can't just sit there watching tv all day .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|otto , i think you should get a job .
marge simpson|so get that piece of paper !
marge simpson|i know how you feel , but he is good with the kids .
marge simpson|but homer , we're the only family he's got ^
marge simpson|well , before you do that , maybe you should take the driving test again .
marge simpson|i wish they had never invented fried cheese !
marge simpson|oh , homer , i love you just the way you are .
marge simpson|lisa , what's that number ?
marge simpson|operator , i'd like to place an order for my husband .
marge simpson|hmmm ^

marge simpson|they don't open their mouths do they ?
marge simpson|how cute .
marge simpson|i don't know if that tape is working .
marge simpson|you ate three desserts tonight .
marge simpson|there's another thing i've been wanting to talk to you about ^
marge simpson|what in god's name are you talking about ?
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|you mean a spoon ?
marge simpson|how was your day at work , dear ?
marge simpson|hands across america ^
marge simpson|this chair is $2 , 000 .

marge simpson|this money was a blessing .
marge simpson|we can't just spend it on some creature comfort .
marge simpson|herb !
marge simpson|how have you been ?
marge simpson|can't complain .
marge simpson|homer , he knows how to work a light switch .
marge simpson|i got the recipe from the utility grade beef counsel .
marge simpson|maybe we should play another game .
marge simpson|that was your idea .
marge simpson|well , i really think we need to replace the washer and dryer .
marge simpson|homer , wait .
marge simpson|herb , what're you talking about ?
marge simpson|that's a very clever idea !
marge simpson|whoooa !
marge simpson|well , it's pretty ingrained .
marge simpson|maggie , you talked !
marge simpson|homer , every mother in the country is going to want one of these .
marge simpson|don't worry , he can't stay mad at you forever .
marge simpson|he is your brother .
marge simpson|herb , i appreciate your generosity , but i don't need any gift from you .
marge simpson|homie , you do remember your promise to the children ?
marge simpson|bart , where's your bathing suit ?

marge simpson|kids , i won't be home tonight , so i'm leaving you some lowcal microwavable tv dinners .
marge simpson|i'm auditioning for a play !
marge simpson|it's a musical version of a streetcar named desire .
marge simpson|isn't that exciting ?
marge simpson|i haven't been in a play since high school , and i thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults .

marge simpson|homer , can you run some lines with me ?
marge simpson|it'll just take a sec .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , llewellyn .

marge simpson|kids , your father doesn't really mean that .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|are you actually giving up your faith ?
marge simpson|i can't believe you're giving up church , homer .
marge simpson|lord , my husband is by no means perfect , but he's a kind , decent man .
marge simpson|please show him the error of his ways .
marge simpson|no , homer .
marge simpson|he doesn't mean to be sacrilegious , lord .
marge simpson|he just likes to sleep in on sundays ^
marge simpson|reverend lovejoy , i had a bit of an ulterior motive in inviting you to dinner .
marge simpson|no , it's nothing bad .
marge simpson|i'm just concerned , because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately .
marge simpson|homer , you're crazy .
marge simpson|tell him this is all crazy .
marge simpson|let's go , kids .
marge simpson|i have a responsibility to raise these children right and unless you change , i'll have to tell them their father is ^

marge simpson|lisa , i know a song that will cheer you up .
marge simpson|there once was an ugly duckling ^
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|i meant you were one of the goodlooking ducks ^
marge simpson|that makes fun of the ugly one .
marge simpson|homer , lisa's already sensitive about her looks .
marge simpson|this is the last thing she needs .
marge simpson|you're looking at her through a father's eyes .
marge simpson|honey , no one's going to force you to do anything ^
marge simpson|but do you know how your father got the money to enter you in this pageant ?
marge simpson|he sold his ride on the duff blimp .
marge simpson|oh , i don't know that she's as attractive as jack nicklaus ^
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|well , yes , that's what i meant , too .

marge simpson|you keep your hands to yourself , mister .
marge simpson|i think you're making him angry .
marge simpson|oh hi , homie .

marge simpson|maybe you should eat more vegetables and less people .
marge simpson|he's not dead .
marge simpson|don't worry , homie .
marge simpson|i'll take care of you .
marge simpson|oh , homer .
marge simpson|now kids , instead of candy , i thought i'd serve an array of healthy fresh fruits .

marge simpson|i really don't see how this helps bart .
marge simpson|homer , we have a problem here .
marge simpson|we're talking about bart .
marge simpson|well , we try , but he has this way of making us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in .
marge simpson|and what if we don't ?
marge simpson|oh , my poor baby .
marge simpson|well , we brought some pizza .
marge simpson|now this is exactly what bart's teacher was talking about .
marge simpson|our son did something wrong and you look the other way .

marge simpson|kitty ?
marge simpson|hmmm , i don't think so .
marge simpson|oh , maggie , when are you going to talk ?

marge simpson|but the story of lisa's first word is very cute .
marge simpson|well , this story begins in this unforgettable spring of 1983 ms .

marge simpson|you're going to have a little brother or sister to play with !
marge simpson|who did this ?

marge simpson|you don't have a cousin frank .
marge simpson|that afternoon , we left bart with my sisters and went househunting .
marge simpson|oh dear .
marge simpson|what's that stench ?
marge simpson|let's keep looking .
marge simpson|we were about to give up , when we found a house that was perfect ^

marge simpson|homie ^
marge simpson|i think the baby's coming .
marge simpson|according to this magazine , bart might be jealous of her .
marge simpson|well , bart , what do you think of little lisa ?
marge simpson|i saved this newspaper from the day lisa was born .
marge simpson|everyone agreed that lisa was a beautiful baby ^
marge simpson|here she is !
marge simpson|i'm sorry , bart , you're too little .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|well , i'm not surprised .
marge simpson|lisa's crazy about you .
marge simpson|she thinks you hung the moon .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|don't write on the rug !
marge simpson|honey , you really shouldn't eat so much in bed .
marge simpson|it's not good for your heart .
marge simpson|homie , what is it ?

marge simpson|my husband is still alive !
marge simpson|oh , that's wonderful !

marge simpson|well , i think we should spend the money on something the whole town can be proud of .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|oooh , it looks like everyone in springfield showed up for this .
marge simpson|my name is marge simpson and i have an idea .
marge simpson|it may sound a little boring at first ^
marge simpson|well surely you've all noticed the terrible condition main street is in .
marge simpson|many of us have destroyed it by leaving winter chains on our tires and carrying too much weight .
marge simpson|and those potholes are becoming a real nuisance .
marge simpson|but main street's still all cracked and broken .
marge simpson|i still think we should have spent the money to fix main street .
marge simpson|homer , no ^
marge simpson|your lifelong dream was to run out on the field during a baseball game , and you did it last year , remember ?
marge simpson|according to this book , the monorail goes over a hundred and fifty miles an hour .
marge simpson|what if something goes wrong ?
marge simpson|it frightens me that you want to work on something that's so unsafe .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|goodnight , homer .
marge simpson|homer , there's a family of opossums in here !
marge simpson|i'm going to see mr lanley .

marge simpson|how fast are they going ?
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer , there's a man here who thinks he can help you .
marge simpson|no , he's a scientist .
marge simpson|it's not batman !
marge simpson|and that was the only folly the people of springfield ever embarked upon except for the popsicle stick skyscraper ^
marge simpson|and the fifty foot magnifying glass ^
marge simpson|and that escalator to nowhere .
marge simpson|kids , i have some bad news .
marge simpson|your great aunt gladys has ^
marge simpson|passed on .
marge simpson|no honey , gladys looked more like your aunt patty .
marge simpson|the funeral's in little neck falls .
marge simpson|looks like we'll have to go to duff gardens another time .
marge simpson|oh homer , quit pouting .
marge simpson|if you don't mind !
marge simpson|we're on our way to a funeral .
marge simpson|homer , that's very rude of you .

marge simpson|you look terrible .

marge simpson|i didn't realize people saw me that way .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i'm fine .
marge simpson|i'm going to my sisters' now .
marge simpson|i'm watching a videotape that could change our lives .
marge simpson|shhh !
marge simpson|that video really opened my eyes .
marge simpson|i can see that i'm just a passiveaggressive coculprit .
marge simpson|by nagging you when you do foolish things , i just enable your lifescript .
marge simpson|exactly !
marge simpson|so from now on , i'm going to quit nagging and have more fun .
marge simpson|homer , did you eat my whole pan of brownies ?
marge simpson|i'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame .
marge simpson|i'm feeling annoyance and frustration , but also tolerance .
marge simpson|good .
marge simpson|i'm glad we had this talk .
marge simpson|brad goodman is coming to town !
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|be quiet !
marge simpson|oh , thank you .
marge simpson|his name is bart .
marge simpson|uh , i don't want to judge the rightness of your ego orientation , but my inner critic says you should've done your job !
marge simpson|i knew it .
marge simpson|if only i had nagged more ^
marge simpson|that's not fair .
marge simpson|the lesson here is that selfimprovement is better left to people who live in big cities .
marge simpson|homer , i have to go out to pick up something for dinner .
marge simpson|money's too tight for steak .
marge simpson|sure , steak .
marge simpson|i know you think the junior campers are square and ^
marge simpson|uncool , but they also do a lot of neat things , like singalongs and flag ceremonies .
marge simpson|homer , you should be more supportive .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|still no help .
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|hi , hober .
marge simpson|dote kiss be , i'b all stuffed up .
marge simpson|oh that's sweet .
marge simpson|guess what .
marge simpson|there's a new place at the mall they'll put your picture on a tshirt .
marge simpson|i got two dollars off because mine got smeared .
marge simpson|good news , honey .
marge simpson|two weeks are up .
marge simpson|you don't have to wear your glasses anymore .
marge simpson|and your scalp and posture seem fine .
marge simpson|this was a wonderful idea , homie .
marge simpson|hey , there's a turkey behind the bed .
marge simpson|actually , i think it might really help our economy .
marge simpson|this could be a whole new beginning for springfield .
marge simpson|in honor of legalized gambling , why not go as the state of nevada ?
marge simpson|then how 'about going as florida ?
marge simpson|you enjoy orange juice , and old people like you .
marge simpson|why ?
marge simpson|your lifelong dream was to be a contestant on the gong show .
marge simpson|and you did it in 1977 , remember ?
marge simpson|hi , homie .
marge simpson|i was for the casino !
marge simpson|legalized gambling is a bad idea .
marge simpson|you can build a casino over my dead body !
marge simpson|blah , blah , blah , blah , blah .
marge simpson|blah , blah , blah .
marge simpson|blah , blah , blah , blah , blah ^
marge simpson|i wonder if they have a lost and found .
marge simpson|oh , what the hey .
marge simpson|oh my god , barney , thank you .
marge simpson|i would never have forgiven myself .
marge simpson|now you stay put , young lady .
marge simpson|i'll catch up to you .
marge simpson|i'll walk .
marge simpson|yeah .
marge simpson|go home .
marge simpson|you're bad luck !
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i won sixty dollars last night .
marge simpson|what happened here ?
marge simpson|oh , i'm sorry .
marge simpson|i have been spending too much time at the casino .
marge simpson|i'll be around more from now on .
marge simpson|sure , honey .
marge simpson|i promise .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|what is it ?
marge simpson|slow down .
marge simpson|think before you say each word .
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|lisa's costume .
marge simpson|homer , i didn't realize .
marge simpson|i'm so sorry .
marge simpson|you know , you're right , homer .
marge simpson|maybe i should get some professional help .
marge simpson|that's true .
marge simpson|will you forgive me ?
marge simpson|homer , when you forgive someone , you can't throw it back at them like that .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|and my necklace .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|that necklace was a priceless bouvier family heirloom .
marge simpson|well ^
marge simpson|yes , i do .
marge simpson|but they're all heirlooms , too .
marge simpson|you have just been robbed by the springfield cat burglar ^
marge simpson|cute .
marge simpson|homer , tell your child what you bought when i sent you to town to get some insurance .
marge simpson|oh , stop blaming the beans .
marge simpson|and don't take candy from strangers .
marge simpson|i don't think the guns are a good idea , homer .
marge simpson|homer , wasn't the whole point to catch the cat burglar ?
marge simpson|oh my !
marge simpson|i had no idea how much this town loved that zirconia .
marge simpson|bart , i've asked you not to whistle that annoying tune .
marge simpson|just a minute !
marge simpson|don't hang up !
marge simpson|what is it ?
marge simpson|oh , it sounds like you really learned something on your field trip .
marge simpson|think you'd be interested in a career as a box maker ?
marge simpson|i don't know , bart .
marge simpson|you're only ten .
marge simpson|well ^
marge simpson|bart , it's time to get ready for the show .
marge simpson|honey , i know you feel a little silly saying the same four words over and over , but you shouldn't .
marge simpson|you're making people happy .
marge simpson|and that's a very hard thing to do .
marge simpson|the best performance of your life ?
marge simpson|i saved these for you , bart .
marge simpson|you'll always have them to remind you of the time when you were the whole world's special little guy .
marge simpson|yes , he's raking leaves .
marge simpson|if he wants to make it up to you so badly , i think you should let him .
marge simpson|it certainly is exotic .
marge simpson|lisa , is that too spicy for you ?
marge simpson|apu , we usually store our cans in the cupboard .
marge simpson|hmm .
marge simpson|oh , we're low on milk for maggie .
marge simpson|you wanna come with me to the kwikemart ?
marge simpson|well , i guess we could go to that new monstromart ^
marge simpson|ooh .
marge simpson|that's a good price for twelve pounds of nutmeg .
marge simpson|but that's the longest .
marge simpson|apu , you've been so helpful .
marge simpson|if it weren't for him , we'd still be in line at the monstromart .
marge simpson|their floors are stickymart .
marge simpson|i guess we've learned that happiness is wherever you find it .
marge simpson|how did it go ?
marge simpson|oh , that'll work out great .
marge simpson|we're out of lucky charms .
marge simpson|that sounds like a good movie .
marge simpson|that toy isn't safe for a baby like maggie .
marge simpson|i understand , honey .
marge simpson|when i was your age there was a ^
marge simpson|hm .
marge simpson|i don't know if it's a good idea to do that while you're driving .
marge simpson|lisa ordinarily , i'd say you should stand up for what you believe in , but you have been doing that an awful lot lately .
marge simpson|i had a malibu stacy when i was little , and i turned out all right .
marge simpson|now let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream .
marge simpson|honey , you're not going to throw red paint at the executives , are you ?
marge simpson|the keebler people were very upset ^
marge simpson|i'm sorry , homie .
marge simpson|well , we respect you .
marge simpson|bart , i told you , don't draw on your father's skull .
marge simpson|pride ?
marge simpson|you know , homer , when i found out about this i went through a wide range of emotions .
marge simpson|first i was nervous , then anxious , then wary , then apprehensive , then kinda sleepy , then worried , and then concerned .
marge simpson|but now i realize that being a spaceman is something you have to do .
marge simpson|homer , when i met you , you weren't an astronaut .
marge simpson|you didn't even know how to use a touchtone .
marge simpson|but i still respected you , and i always will , no matter what .
marge simpson|homer , you already dialed .
marge simpson|but on the other hand , when you don't take advantage of an opportunity , you can end up regretting it for the rest of your life .
marge simpson|oh , i am so proud of you .
marge simpson|and i know it's going to go just fine ^
marge simpson|don't worry , kids , i'm sure your father's all right .
marge simpson|who wants ginger snaps ?
marge simpson|homie , you should be proud .
marge simpson|only a handful of people have done what you've done .
marge simpson|bart , do you have something nice to say to your father ?
marge simpson|those aren't tickets to the game , homer .
marge simpson|oooh , the walls are melting again .
marge simpson|homer , that's not god , that's just a waffle that bart tossed up there .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|are you planning to hit ned flanders with that pipe and take his tickets ?
marge simpson|homer , that's our wedding photo .
marge simpson|homey , i'm very proud of you , but don't you think you're spending too much time with ned ?
marge simpson|your family needs you too .
marge simpson|that was you !
marge simpson|there .
marge simpson|i hope the children enjoy my special fruit punch .
marge simpson|but , why would the advisory board give us bad advice ?
marge simpson|that was a very nice thing you did , homey .
marge simpson|sandwich .
marge simpson|underpants .
marge simpson|bowling ball ^
marge simpson|more underpants ^
marge simpson|no one's going anywhere .
marge simpson|we're going to clean the whole house from top to bottom .
marge simpson|i think you'll find that escape is impossible .
marge simpson|now each one of you take a floor and get started .
marge simpson|fine .
marge simpson|oh bart .
marge simpson|cleaning doesn't have to be a chore .
marge simpson|here ^
marge simpson|work to the music .
marge simpson|you're not done .
marge simpson|i want you to throw away these old calendars and tv guides .
marge simpson|stop remembering tv and get back to work .
marge simpson|homer , what's going on down there ?
marge simpson|then stop screaming so loud .
marge simpson|there !
marge simpson|isn't that a lot better ?
marge simpson|now you can do whatever you want .
marge simpson|but don't mess up the house .
marge simpson|or doubleply windows !
marge simpson|they look just like regular windows but they'll save us four percent on our heating bill ^
marge simpson|well , they will .
marge simpson|homer , it looks like it could gore .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|i really think this is a bad idea .
marge simpson|ew , homer , there is a bird on your head ?
marge simpson|stampy's food bill today was three hundred dollars .
marge simpson|oh my lord !
marge simpson|a female deer .
marge simpson|get a rope , bart !
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|this is just what happened at the caramel factory .
marge simpson|gosh , i thought he'd be happier in his true habitat .
marge simpson|then why is he attacking all those other elephants ?
marge simpson|bart , this isn't the kind of thing i normally would think was a good idea , but you wouldn't have to live with mr burns , you'd just get all of his money someday .
marge simpson|this could provide for your entire future .
marge simpson|uh , sure .
marge simpson|i've gotta stop fantasizing about lee majors .
marge simpson|ah , one more .
marge simpson|no it's not .
marge simpson|i think bart and lisa are feeling a little upset right now .
marge simpson|isn't there something you'd like to say ?
marge simpson|are you thinking what i'm thinking ?
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|you know , bart , since he is giving you all of his money , maybe it would be nice if you spend some time with him .
marge simpson|c'mon , honey .
marge simpson|bart , don't throw peas at your sister .
marge simpson|homer , say something .
marge simpson|i'm very concerned .
marge simpson|mr burns has stolen our son and he won't give him back .
marge simpson|you know we should really stop hiring him .
marge simpson|are you sure you can get him back for us ?
marge simpson|what about peter fonda ?
marge simpson|homer , that's hans moleman .
marge simpson|lisa , what are you doing ?
marge simpson|that's sweet , honey .
marge simpson|the point is the real simpson family missed you a lot and we're really glad you're home .
marge simpson|homer , i want that thing out of my house .
marge simpson|i'm not sure if i'm comfortable with the idea of your classmates laughing at our family's private moments .
marge simpson|how would you like it if , twenty years from now , people were laughing at things you did ?
marge simpson|why don't you bring this potato ?
marge simpson|it's pretty big .
marge simpson|i just think they're neat .
marge simpson|the dog has had enough excitement .
marge simpson|ned , homer and i are a little concerned with the way the school's being run .
marge simpson|what's going on in there ?
marge simpson|it says freddy quimby beat a waiter half to death .
marge simpson|those quimby children are so wild and rich .
marge simpson|i hope he finally gets what's coming to him .
marge simpson|well , bart , your uncle arthur used to have a saying , shoot 'em all and let god sort 'em out .
marge simpson|unfortunately , one day he put his theory into practice .
marge simpson|it took seventyfive federal marshals to bring him down .
marge simpson|now , let's never speak of him again .
marge simpson|hmm ?
marge simpson|honey , you should listen to your heart , and not the voices in your head , like a certain uncle did one grey december morn .
marge simpson|good for you , homie .
marge simpson|you know , a lot of things happened around here while you were gone .
marge simpson|give me those ^
marge simpson|and those .
marge simpson|and those !
marge simpson|homer , you didn't do a very good job frosting maggie's birthday cake .
marge simpson|hey , hey , hey hey , stop it !
marge simpson|i made a special cake for you to ruin .
marge simpson|it's over there .
marge simpson|everybody get ready !
marge simpson|here comes the birthday girl in her very first dress !
marge simpson|uhoh .
marge simpson|maggie , we have a surprise for you .
marge simpson|homey , you know , it's funny both my mother and your father seem pretty lonely .
marge simpson|yeah .
marge simpson|anyway , maybe they could go to a matinee together , or shopping , or to that room in the library that's always full of old people .
marge simpson|periodicals , that's it .
marge simpson|homer , would you please stop reading that ross perot pamphlet ?
marge simpson|say !
marge simpson|i've got a neat idea .
marge simpson|why don't you go in and pick up my mother , and we'll all go out to dinner .
marge simpson|that's not my mother .
marge simpson|you know , mom , you and abe have a lot in common .
marge simpson|umm , you both got swindled by that telemarketing scam .
marge simpson|well , i think it's wonderful that your father has fallen in love with my mother .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|homer , what possible reason could you have against grampa being in love ?
marge simpson|hello , mom ?
marge simpson|fine .
marge simpson|you know , abe had a very nice time with you last sunday ^
marge simpson|grampa , sssh !
marge simpson|i know my mother .
marge simpson|if you come on too strong , she's going to get scared away .
marge simpson|uh ^
marge simpson|i love ya , mom !
marge simpson|i love ya !
marge simpson|i love ya !
marge simpson|i love ya !
marge simpson|i love ya !
marge simpson|i love ya !
marge simpson|i love ya !
marge simpson|i love ya , mom !
marge simpson|gotta go !
marge simpson|mom's almost ready for her date .
marge simpson|she sure seems taken by this new beau .
marge simpson|i feel so bad for grampa .
marge simpson|he's an awful , awful , awful man , but i guess if he makes mom happy , that's all that really matters .
marge simpson|mom , you can't marry mr burns !
marge simpson|he's an evil man !
marge simpson|what about abe simpson ?
marge simpson|don't you have any feelings for him ?
marge simpson|we're all aware of grampa's problems , but compared to mr burns , he's judge freaking reinhold !
marge simpson|hm ?
marge simpson|hm ?
marge simpson|we don't think you're slow .
marge simpson|but , on the other hand , it's not like you go to museums or read books or anything .
marge simpson|oh homie , if you feel so bad about yourself , there's always things you can do to feel better .
marge simpson|there's that .
marge simpson|or , you could take an adult education course .
marge simpson|that's because you were drunk !
marge simpson|homer , that's supposed to be leather patches on a tweed blazer , not the other way around .
marge simpson|you've ruined a perfectly good jacket .
marge simpson|whatever do you mean ?
marge simpson|i don't dye my hair ^
marge simpson|i don't know what you're talking about .
marge simpson|that's nice .
marge simpson|homer , i really don't like you telling personal secrets in your class .
marge simpson|today at the kwikemart everybody knew i dyed my hair .
marge simpson|mmhmm .
marge simpson|i'm happy about that .
marge simpson|but , i think you can be a good teacher and still respect our privacy .
marge simpson|homer , don't ever tell them personal stuff about me again .
marge simpson|homer , don't you have to get to class ?
marge simpson|oh , well that will be ^
marge simpson|what the darn ^
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|i want this to end now !
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|okay .
marge simpson|everybody out !
marge simpson|get out !
marge simpson|get out !
marge simpson|get out !
marge simpson|you , too .
marge simpson|get out !
marge simpson|you just don't get it , do you , homer ?
marge simpson|you told personal things about our lives even after you promised you wouldn't .
marge simpson|i can't trust you anymore .
marge simpson|kids , your father and i are going through a really tough time right now .
marge simpson|and i don't know what's going to happen , but just remember that both your mom and your dad love you very very much .
marge simpson|but , isn't that a sin ?
marge simpson|funny ^
marge simpson|the way everything reminds me of homer .
marge simpson|oh my .
marge simpson|i'm very flattered , but i'm not really interested .
marge simpson|why don't you come inside for a drink of water ?
marge simpson|here's your water , moe .
marge simpson|homer , what happened to you ?
marge simpson|oh , here , let me help you .
marge simpson|homer , that's not a good thing .
marge simpson|but , how do i know i can trust you ?
marge simpson|i must admit , you really do make a gal feel needed .
marge simpson|and i have a special present for you , but i'll give it to you later tonight .
marge simpson|homer , the fridge wasn't meant to be used this way .
marge simpson|although i must say , it's certainly refreshing .
marge simpson|won't this overload the motor ?
marge simpson|is it true we should wait at least an hour after eating before we go in ?
marge simpson|who could that be ^
marge simpson|bart ^
marge simpson|are all these children friends of yours ?
marge simpson|oh , look .
marge simpson|there's bart .
marge simpson|wave to him .
marge simpson|hmm , maybe we should spend more time with bart .
marge simpson|he's becoming isolated and weird .
marge simpson|this was a lovely idea , homie .
marge simpson|come here and kiss me .
marge simpson|i wish you'd stop spreading bad rumors about people .
marge simpson|remember how you got grampa tarred and feathered ?
marge simpson|my , these seas are certainly heaving .
marge simpson|does that earring mean you're a pirate ?
marge simpson|lisa , stop blowing my sex !
marge simpson|i mean , stop blowing your sax .
marge simpson|your sax .
marge simpson|stop it .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , but i sacrificed a very expensive camera just to get some quiet time .
marge simpson|what !
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|i don't know , honey .
marge simpson|i guess that's the school's decision to make .
marge simpson|lisa !
marge simpson|i am nice .
marge simpson|homer , i really appreciate you making dinner , but this food tastes a little strange .
marge simpson|but the grocery store sells sugar for thirtyfive cents a pound .
marge simpson|well , you'll always be number one to me ^
marge simpson|uh ^
marge simpson|i meant , my number one girl .
marge simpson|oh , for chri ^
marge simpson|honey , if you get too competitive you'll never be happy .
marge simpson|no matter how good you are there's always gonna be someone better than you .
marge simpson|i always thought i had the tallest hair .
marge simpson|but that trip to graceland really opened my eyes .
marge simpson|believe me , honey .
marge simpson|she's more scared of you than you are of her .
marge simpson|while you were out earning that dollar , you lost forty dollars by not going to work .
marge simpson|the plant called and said if you don't come in tomorrow , don't bother coming in monday .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer , homer !
marge simpson|i want you to forget about guarding this stupid sugar .
marge simpson|you're being completely paranoid .
marge simpson|homer , when are you gonna give up this crazy sugar scheme ?
marge simpson|look , just get rid of the sugar , okay ?
marge simpson|i'm sorry , homie .
marge simpson|this romance is so full of heartfelt passion .
marge simpson|i can really identify with this cornfed heroine .
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|are you awake ?
marge simpson|this is important , give me some sign you're awake .
marge simpson|wake up !
marge simpson|homie , do you think that the romance has gone out of our lives ?
marge simpson|wake up !
marge simpson|it's nine thirty p .
marge simpson|m .
marge simpson|and you spent your whole saturday drinking beer in maggie's kiddy pool .
marge simpson|i can hit that one pin all right .
marge simpson|but the rest of them don't even wobble .
marge simpson|homer , young people learn about love from adults , and we've been setting a terrible example for our children and the community in general .
marge simpson|i want us to deal with the issues raised by this book .
marge simpson|i knew i shouldn't have put a fireplace in the bedroom .
marge simpson|how many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon ?
marge simpson|yes , they do , and when was the last time you heard anyone talk about ren and stimpy ?
marge simpson|children , your father and i have fed you and clothed you , but we've neglected something more important .
marge simpson|it's time to learn about love .
marge simpson|i mean romance not love .
marge simpson|that's not true .
marge simpson|romance is all around us .
marge simpson|in our neighborhoods ^
marge simpson|even on our jobs ^
marge simpson|all you have to do is think about your most cherished memories .
marge simpson|no , no , no .
marge simpson|no , ask your heart what its fondest desire is .
marge simpson|no , think about people .
marge simpson|about moments in your life that have been very romantic .
marge simpson|that's not the idea at all .
marge simpson|okay , well this story isn't ideal , i've never told it to you before .
marge simpson|i got a very thoughtless birthday present from someone who shall remain nameless .
marge simpson|so i actually went to the bowling alley to spite him , or her ^
marge simpson|oh !
marge simpson|i'm awfully sorry .
marge simpson|oh , no , no .
marge simpson|homer is my ^
marge simpson|ball's name .
marge simpson|i'm marge .
marge simpson|no ^
marge simpson|no , thank you , mr .
marge simpson|uh ^
marge simpson|brunswick .
marge simpson|jacques .
marge simpson|hmmm .
marge simpson|sure .
marge simpson|never .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|oh , i don't want to trouble you .
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|but i'm not very good .
marge simpson|oh !
marge simpson|but ^
marge simpson|you're a very good teacher !
marge simpson|you didn't have to drop me off .
marge simpson|oh , jacques , i'm a married woman .
marge simpson|what's brunch ?
marge simpson|you didn't have to drop me off .
marge simpson|he seemed to know a lot about brunch .
marge simpson|but it turned out he wasn't interested in brunch at all .
marge simpson|that doesn't shock me .
marge simpson|is thursday okay ?
marge simpson|thank goodness i drove down an ironic street .
marge simpson|i made the right decision to stay with my homie , and there was no harm done .
marge simpson|so if you kind of mentally snip out the part where i already had a husband , that's my idea of romance .
marge simpson|okay , homer .
marge simpson|this was a wonderful idea , homie .
marge simpson|yes , what did happen to her ?
marge simpson|good .
marge simpson|does anyone else have a love story ?
marge simpson|lisa , not all romances turn out that way .
marge simpson|bart , do you have a love story that doesn't end in heartbreak ?
marge simpson|well , as jerry lee lewis would say there's a whole lotta frowning going on .
marge simpson|of course .
marge simpson|remember when ^
marge simpson|your aunt selma got married ?
marge simpson|oh , wait , wait , that's no good .
marge simpson|i know , your grandfather .
marge simpson|it all started on an outing for dinner ^
marge simpson|say !
marge simpson|i've got a neat idea .
marge simpson|why don't you go in and pick up my mother , and we'll all go out to dinner .
marge simpson|that's not my mother .
marge simpson|they hit it off right away .
marge simpson|but there were rivals for the fair lady's hand ^
marge simpson|but in the end , just when things looked worse , true love triumphed .
marge simpson|i give up .
marge simpson|did anybody learn anything about love tonight ?
marge simpson|there's that side of it .
marge simpson|but there's also ^
marge simpson|help me out here , lisa .
marge simpson|well , kids , i tried .
marge simpson|maybe you're right .
marge simpson|gee , artie .
marge simpson|artie wait .
marge simpson|i don't know .
marge simpson|i mean , it was it was a beautiful evening .
marge simpson|let's not ruin it .
marge simpson|artie , please !
marge simpson|no , oh , artie !
marge simpson|now , really , i mean it .
marge simpson|now stop it !
marge simpson|take me home , artie .
marge simpson|yeah , right .
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|yeah , you want a ride ?
marge simpson|you know homer , when i got home , i realized who i should have gone to the prom with .
marge simpson|my prom date .
marge simpson|why so glum ?
marge simpson|mmmm , homie ^
marge simpson|see kids , that's what i meant by romance .
marge simpson|no , i've already planned our vacation .
marge simpson|we're going to the highway 9 bird sanctuary .
marge simpson|i understand they've installed a new bird feeder this year .
marge simpson|it's shaped like a diner .
marge simpson|and it's on this really tall pole .
marge simpson|hmm ?
marge simpson|oooh .
marge simpson|reciperelated bumper cars .
marge simpson|now wait a minute .
marge simpson|i'm not sure about this .
marge simpson|every time we've ever gone on vacation , i end up being horribly embarrassed , we end up in a big fight , and we come home more miserable than when we left .
marge simpson|you have to promise me that this isn't going to happen this time .
marge simpson|well , there was our trip to the amish country ^
marge simpson|even worse was our trip to sandy beach .
marge simpson|this year i want us to do things together as a family and get a lot of good exercise outdoors so we'll have a lot of wonderful memories of our vacation .
marge simpson|and remember , every morning give one bowl of kibble to santa's little helper .
marge simpson|do you want me to write any of this down ?
marge simpson|what's the matter with you , homer ?
marge simpson|we don't have any fruits or vegetables in the car .
marge simpson|we'd better find a motel and stop for the night .
marge simpson|homer , no .
marge simpson|you're going to get lost .
marge simpson|such a violent motif .
marge simpson|oh , please .
marge simpson|it was just a figure of speech .
marge simpson|when do you show the consequences ?
marge simpson|on tv , that mouse pulled out that cat's lungs and played them like a bagpipe .
marge simpson|but in the next scene , the cat was breathing comfortably .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|we just got here and already i'm mortified beyond belief by your embarrassing behavior .
marge simpson|oh , i see .
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|i'll have the baby guts .
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|you're sure she'll have fun here ?
marge simpson|tortureland , explosion land , searing gas pain land , unnecessary surgery land ^
marge simpson|it's cute , but i'm sure it's very sharp , and probably dirty .

marge simpson|that's why your robot never worked .
marge simpson|this is just what i was hoping for .
marge simpson|spending the day together as a family .
marge simpson|ah , you know , part of spending time together as a family is spending time apart as individuals .
marge simpson|yuhhuh .
marge simpson|i'm sure we'll appreciate each other all the more when we meet up at dinner .
marge simpson|are you kids gonna be alright ?
marge simpson|kids ?
marge simpson|hey , the bartender even looks like john travolta .
marge simpson|it must be wonderful to ring in the new year over and over and over .

marge simpson|i wish there was a hole i could just crawl into and die .
marge simpson|stay away from me , homer !
marge simpson|i have nothing to say to you .
marge simpson|how were you a political prisoner ?
marge simpson|oh for gosh sakes , what now ?
marge simpson|i knew we should have gone to the bird sanctuary .
marge simpson|oh my , it looks like we're doomed !
marge simpson|i don't approve of that .
marge simpson|are you two bonkers ?
marge simpson|we almost got killed , not to mention all the embarrassment i suffered .
marge simpson|you know , you're right .
marge simpson|this truly was the best vacation ever .
marge simpson|now , let us never speak of it again .
marge simpson|i hope you realize now that violence on tv may be funny , but it's not so funny when that violence is happening to you .
marge simpson|oh my .
marge simpson|lisa , go to your room .
marge simpson|this sounds awfully controversial .
marge simpson|lisa , you know i don't like controversy in this house .
marge simpson|bart , i wish you wouldn't lie like that .
marge simpson|homer , we've got to stop them .
marge simpson|homer , did you remember to lock the front door of the house ?
marge simpson|when you locked the front door , did you remember to lock the back door ?
marge simpson|homer , i'm impressed .
marge simpson|you're taking this quite well .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|we're just gonna have to wait and see .
marge simpson|homer !

marge simpson|you're back with your family now , where there's nothing to be afraid of except that fog that turns people inside out .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|lisa !
marge simpson|time for church .
marge simpson|you just answered your own question with that commode mouth .
marge simpson|besides , you kids need to learn morals and decency , and how to love your fellow man .
marge simpson|i don't want you playing with something that has such bizarre hair .
marge simpson|awful , awful hair .
marge simpson|oh that's sweet , homer .
marge simpson|our son is growing up , isn't he ?
marge simpson|have you noticed any change in bart ?
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|he looks like something might be disturbing him .
marge simpson|i guess we could get more involved in bart's activities .
marge simpson|but then i'd be afraid of smothering him .
marge simpson|that's not what i meant .
marge simpson|time for church , bart .
marge simpson|i bet your little friend jessica will be there .
marge simpson|thirty cents off shake 'n bake .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homer , stop that .
marge simpson|i believe him .
marge simpson|that's what he wore to church .
marge simpson|bart honey , do you know who did take the money ?
marge simpson|we really shouldn't have let them do this .
marge simpson|it can't be helping his self esteem .
marge simpson|uh , i think you all owe my son an apology .
marge simpson|lisa , your father and i are very concerned about this warning .
marge simpson|i really hope you try harder .
marge simpson|cheer up .
marge simpson|so you're not good at sports .
marge simpson|it's a very small part of life .
marge simpson|i think lisa needs to feel a little special tonight .
marge simpson|how about letting her ride up front , too ?
marge simpson|well , i think women should be able to play any sport men play , but hockey is so violent and dangerous .
marge simpson|look at milhouse's teeth .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i can't even watch .
marge simpson|i don't know how you two can sit here laughing at poor lisa while she's out there probably scared to death .
marge simpson|absolutely , honey .
marge simpson|by blocking the net i really think you helped your team .
marge simpson|bart , i can spend some time with you .
marge simpson|don't have a stereotypical view of me just because i'm your mother .
marge simpson|i know .
marge simpson|how about we play the basketball ?
marge simpson|i'm no harvey globetrotter , but ^

marge simpson|moe , i think you should leave .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|homer , we can't root for one child over the other .
marge simpson|you wouldn't like it if the kids played favorites with us .

marge simpson|i demand vengeance !
marge simpson|i want vengeance !
marge simpson|i've never been so proud of them .
marge simpson|oh , well thank you homer .
marge simpson|but take one of the kids .
marge simpson|homer , are all these pockets necessary ?
marge simpson|well , that's the babysitter .
marge simpson|no one in town will sit for you two anymore .
marge simpson|i had to choose between a grad student at the university and a scarylooking hobo .
marge simpson|well there's also a baby somewhere upstairs !
marge simpson|will you two stop saying gummy so much .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i won't make a spectacle out of myself any further .
marge simpson|oooh ^
marge simpson|how'd they get there ?
marge simpson|i'm sure it'll turn up .
marge simpson|take the babysitter home now .
marge simpson|she's been sitting in the car for twenty minutes .
marge simpson|well why don't we give it to some needy children , then ?
marge simpson|at any rate , i believe you and i think you should go outside and straighten this out .
marge simpson|some of their chants are very catchy and memorable .
marge simpson|they seem to be building some sort of a shantytown .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|wake up !
marge simpson|wake up !
marge simpson|i already talked to the indignation coordinator out on the lawn today .
marge simpson|i told her you were a decent man .
marge simpson|but she wouldn't listen .
marge simpson|besides standing by you and supporting you , there isn't anything more i can do .
marge simpson|homer , that's your solution to everything , to move under the sea .
marge simpson|it's not gonna happen .
marge simpson|look , maybe this whole thing will blow over .
marge simpson|yes , yes , yes .
marge simpson|that's fine .
marge simpson|good , good .
marge simpson|oh really ?
marge simpson|i hope you kept the homie fires burning ^
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|the kids have a great idea on how you can clear your name !
marge simpson|well , we can dress it up a bit .
marge simpson|we can bring a fern ^
marge simpson|and a folding chair from the garage ^
marge simpson|and the most decorative thing of all the truth .
marge simpson|there are only fortynine stars on that flag .
marge simpson|you know , the courts might not work anymore , but as long as everybody is videotaping everyone else , justice will be done .
marge simpson|groundskeeper willie saved you , homer .
marge simpson|hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything you hear ?
marge simpson|is there something wrong , homie ?
marge simpson|don't turn on the light !
marge simpson|don't turn on the light !
marge simpson|oh , bart .
marge simpson|it's just an old golf umbrella stuck in a tree .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|we need to talk about the ^
marge simpson|marital difficulties we've been having lately .
marge simpson|i simply can't wait that long .
marge simpson|maybe we should get some help ^
marge simpson|how 'bout a book ?
marge simpson|a tasteful book .
marge simpson|shh .
marge simpson|i don't want people to see us looking at these books .
marge simpson|oh , i'm just reading up on , artillery .
marge simpson|this one's a good choice , and it's not too smutty .
marge simpson|it's a book on tape by paul harvey , you know , that nice midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of grampa .
marge simpson|sane planning sensible tomorrow .
marge simpson|homeie , i can't quite ^
marge simpson|so am i .
marge simpson|kids ?
marge simpson|kids ?
marge simpson|the arabian nights room looks nice ^
marge simpson|this isn't very erotic .
marge simpson|i think it's an actual utility room .
marge simpson|here he is , rex harrison and paul anka rolled into one !
marge simpson|that tonic really works !
marge simpson|you and grampa should bottle it and go into business together .
marge simpson|you could make a lot of money .
marge simpson|you threw them out the window in a fit of passion .
marge simpson|you said you were never going to need them again .
marge simpson|homie , are you really going to ignore grampa for the rest of your life ?
marge simpson|you didn't want to have bart .
marge simpson|you tell bart all the time .
marge simpson|you told him this morning .
marge simpson|what if you pretended that this couch were a bar ?
marge simpson|then you could spend more nights at home with us .
marge simpson|huh ?
marge simpson|i just left my first session and i haven't even opened my mouth yet .
marge simpson|i don't know , homer .
marge simpson|we're right in the middle of the busy housekeeping season .
marge simpson|i don't want to be a wet blanket , but getting on a plane like that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden .
marge simpson|oh , i forgot to clean the lint basket in the dryer .
marge simpson|if someone broke into the house and did laundry , it could start a fire .
marge simpson|i think i'll go get a picture of the plane taking off .
marge simpson|homer , i've never told you this before , but i'm not a good flyer .
marge simpson|i have to get off the plane .

marge simpson|the kids at school were even worse .
marge simpson|they do so !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|but it's true .
marge simpson|they didn't write their own songs or play their own instruments .

marge simpson|undersecretary for international protocol .
marge simpson|brat and punk division .

marge simpson|you'll just have to find some other country to have relations with .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|that's better .
marge simpson|homer , that's enough .
marge simpson|australia was originally founded as a settlement for british convicts .

marge simpson|it's clever , just like you .
marge simpson|huh ?
marge simpson|huh ?
marge simpson|we have them in america .
marge simpson|they're called bullfrogs .
marge simpson|i can't believe our government would set up bart like that .
marge simpson|i must say , i'm very angry at the state department right now .
marge simpson|oh , for the love of criminy !
marge simpson|gimme that !
marge simpson|i know bart did something wrong , but he's my son and i'm going to punish him myself .
marge simpson|our countries may have their differences , but as human beings i think we can all agree there's no substitute for the discipline of a loving parent .
marge simpson|he wants to talk to you .
marge simpson|no deal !
marge simpson|this is my son we're talking about .
marge simpson|sure he's not perfect , but who is in this workaday world ?
marge simpson|i'm glad you're okay honey , but i wish you'd chosen a more tasteful way to be patriotic .
marge simpson|this is a special occasion .
marge simpson|patty and selma just got promoted at the dmv .
marge simpson|i'm sorry .
marge simpson|homer doesn't mean to be rude , he's just a very complicated man .
marge simpson|i wish you wouldn't put homer down like that .
marge simpson|he may not be a big success like you , but i can always count on him to provide for the family .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homer , wake up .
marge simpson|there's still a few minutes 'til our usual bedtime .
marge simpson|money problems ?
marge simpson|homer , are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble ?
marge simpson|bart , i told you before , stop gnawing on the drywall .
marge simpson|patty , selma .
marge simpson|what are you doing here ?
marge simpson|homer , be careful with my sisters' heads .
marge simpson|their necks are brittle .
marge simpson|what's that supposed to mean ?
marge simpson|this has been such a nice , peaceful dinner , it calls for a celebration .
marge simpson|i'm going to make the most international coffee in the house , montreal morn .
marge simpson|i'm sorry .
marge simpson|all we have is nescafe .
marge simpson|i'm very , very sorry .
marge simpson|you are ?
marge simpson|what's going on in here ?

marge simpson|homer , is this projection accurate ?
marge simpson|did you borrow money from my sisters ?
marge simpson|homer , homer why didn't you tell me ?
marge simpson|not too good , lisa .
marge simpson|frankly , he's underneath the table .
marge simpson|but i like to make you breakfast .
marge simpson|tested , homer , god tested moses .
marge simpson|and try to be nice to my sisters .
marge simpson|it's very hard on me to have you fighting all the time .
marge simpson|so homer , how'd you do ?
marge simpson|that's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters .
marge simpson|no , homie .
marge simpson|you see .
marge simpson|you see , this is the stuff i've been telling you about that you never see .
marge simpson|no , homer .
marge simpson|i think we should call a town meeting .
marge simpson|if we don't do something soon , we won't get any tourists at all .
marge simpson|i'm marge simpson , and i have an idea .
marge simpson|now i know you haven't liked some of my past suggestions .

marge simpson|homer , please pay attention .
marge simpson|there's just one more movie .
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|it's time to vote for the grand prize .
marge simpson|second .
marge simpson|why don't we all take a five minute break ?
marge simpson|it'll clear our heads .

marge simpson|homie , you voted for the right movie .
marge simpson|i'm glad you were on the jury .
marge simpson|well , jay , i hope you tell your new york friends that people in small towns aren't quite as dumb as they think .
marge simpson|well , it was a lovely festival .

marge simpson|oh really ?
marge simpson|did you see the loom ?
marge simpson|i took loom in high school .
marge simpson|lisa !
marge simpson|hello !
marge simpson|how're you doing in england ?
marge simpson|remember , an elevator is called a lift , a mile is called a kilometer , and botulism is called steak and kidney pie .
marge simpson|all right !
marge simpson|lisa , that's wonderful .
marge simpson|if only your father was still with us ^
marge simpson|but he left for work a few minutes ago .
marge simpson|oh , don't worry , honey .
marge simpson|i guarantee your father will behave .
marge simpson|this ?

marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|maggie !
marge simpson|company eating rules .
marge simpson|maggie !

marge simpson|lisa , i can't believe it's your wedding day already .
marge simpson|oh , milhouse doesn't count .
marge simpson|here .
marge simpson|all right , who broke my vase ?
marge simpson|well , i'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves , now did they ?

marge simpson|yes , the dog ^
marge simpson|excuse me , we're having a problem with our dog ^
marge simpson|no , no , our dog is out of control .
marge simpson|he's wild , destructive , and has little or no respect for authority .
marge simpson|homer , hold on to the wheel !
marge simpson|oh , this place is so big .
marge simpson|do you think we should split up and look for them , homie ?
marge simpson|homie ?
marge simpson|she's the fastest ^
marge simpson|homer , i don't think that means necessarily ^
marge simpson|uhoh ^
marge simpson|i think they're in love .
marge simpson|but she's not our dog .
marge simpson|but won't you miss her loyalty and companionship ?
marge simpson|okay , you can go out and play , but ^
marge simpson|no more you know what in front of the house , all right ?
marge simpson|hey , what did i just say ?
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|don't ever say that word again !
marge simpson|well , i'm going to write the dictionary people and have that checked .
marge simpson|it feels like a mistake to me .
marge simpson|oh , my god !
marge simpson|she's having babies !
marge simpson|oh , i'm sorry , girl .
marge simpson|i thought you were just getting fat .
marge simpson|homer , homer find a place for all these little miracles .
marge simpson|oh , my .
marge simpson|i've never seen anything like this .
marge simpson|oh , homie , aren't they adorable ?
marge simpson|look at branford ii !
marge simpson|isn't that cute ?
marge simpson|he thinks he's one of the models , inc .
marge simpson|well , it's just easier this way .
marge simpson|yeeesch !
marge simpson|this house stinks !
marge simpson|you're not just putting the new newspapers over the old ones , are you ?
marge simpson|now i know we love the puppies very much , but i think they're getting to be a problem .
marge simpson|all right , we'll give the dogs one more chance .
marge simpson|as long as the puppies don't do anything else wrong , they stay .
marge simpson|on a completely unrelated topic , i'm having a very , very important dinner party tonight .
marge simpson|rev .
marge simpson|lovejoy , your old army drill sergeant , and the regional director of the irs .
marge simpson|we've got to be realistic , kids .
marge simpson|who's gonna have a big enough heart to take care of twentyfive puppies ?
marge simpson|she's right , homer .
marge simpson|there's something about his face i don't trust .
marge simpson|my , he certainly took that well .
marge simpson|dogs !
marge simpson|chief , you're getting powdered sugar all over my floor !
marge simpson|dinner's on , dogs !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|for the love of god , no .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|lisa !
marge simpson|what are you two doing home so early ?
marge simpson|bart , leave that crowbar here .
marge simpson|you know i don't like you prying and jimmying .
marge simpson|honey , maybe you should relax a little ?
marge simpson|i'm worried about the kids , homie .
marge simpson|lisa's becoming very obsessive .
marge simpson|this morning i caught her trying to dissect her own rain coat .
marge simpson|and bart isn't doing very well either .
marge simpson|he needs boundaries , and structure .
marge simpson|there's something about flying a kite at night that's so unwholesome .
marge simpson|that's it .
marge simpson|we have to get them back to school .
marge simpson|hello class .
marge simpson|hi bart .
marge simpson|over here , sweetie .
marge simpson|it's me , mom .
marge simpson|hi .
marge simpson|hey .

marge simpson|i'm bart simpson's mother .
marge simpson|thank you .
marge simpson|ohh ^
marge simpson|kids have been doing that one since my day .
marge simpson|exhausting .
marge simpson|it took the children forty minutes to locate canada on the map .
marge simpson|i'd be thrilled .
marge simpson|you can start right now .
marge simpson|and i'm gonna keep teaching your class .
marge simpson|like it or lump it .
marge simpson|i hate it when he gets in there .
marge simpson|ah , here you go , precious .
marge simpson|now go off with your friends .
marge simpson|that's a very nice jig , kearney .
marge simpson|now , isn't dancing much more fun than bullying ?
marge simpson|bart , are you ready for your history test ?
marge simpson|ok .
marge simpson|who was george washington carver ?
marge simpson|bart , you said you were going to study .
marge simpson|you just don't want to take that test .
marge simpson|homer , this is an operation !
marge simpson|how's my special little guy ?
marge simpson|marge !
marge simpson|lisa , it's normal to be sad when a friend dies , and bleeding gums was a good friend to you .
marge simpson|but nobody is really gone as long as we remember them .
marge simpson|homer , this is a cemetery .
marge simpson|what do you do , follow my husband around ?
marge simpson|hm , maybe you can get the local jazz station to do a tribute to him .
marge simpson|that's mary had a little lamb .
marge simpson|that's the same thing !
marge simpson|you just replaced dees with doos !
marge simpson|aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture ?
marge simpson|ah , c'mon , homer , there's lasers .
marge simpson|you like lasers .
marge simpson|homie , these games are fixed .
marge simpson|he looks and acts just like the dealer .
marge simpson|i think they're related or at least in cahoots .
marge simpson|homer , he cheated you .
marge simpson|it's people like you who are ruining our downtown promenades and piazzas .
marge simpson|how dare you prey on the greedy and stupid , like this .
marge simpson|somebody stop him !
marge simpson|he's getting away !
marge simpson|c'mon !
marge simpson|c'mon !
marge simpson|uh , i must warn you , um , uh , sometimes ordinary people ggget a surge of uh adrenaline .
marge simpson|weeaah !
marge simpson|see ?
marge simpson|ah , i think i'm okay .
marge simpson|it was scary , but , in a weird way , it was also kind of exhilarating .
marge simpson|oh for crying out loud ^
marge simpson|lisa , unhand your brother .
marge simpson|well , it was pretty exciting , but celery soup's pretty exciting too .
marge simpson|strange , regular ham doesn't thrill me anymore .
marge simpson|i'm crossing over to deviled ham .
marge simpson|whoa !
marge simpson|thanks benevenstanciano .
marge simpson|death sports .
marge simpson|excuse me ^
marge simpson|actually , i'm interested in becoming a police officer .
marge simpson|you got it , little buddy .
marge simpson|homer , there's no reason for you to feel threatened .
marge simpson|you'll always be the man of this house .
marge simpson|hey everybody , mom's home .
marge simpson|they didn't have my size shirt , but you get the idea .
marge simpson|oh , homie , of course i will .
marge simpson|i suppose i would .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|well , thank you , honey .
marge simpson|homer , give me my pepper spray .
marge simpson|hello , mr hutz .
marge simpson|i just wanted to say hello .
marge simpson|two hundred .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|i mean , i mean nothing .
marge simpson|i don't take bribes .
marge simpson|apu , no .
marge simpson|that's better .
marge simpson|i got a report on a domestic disturbance at this address .
marge simpson|umhmmm .
marge simpson|who called the police ?
marge simpson|look , why don't you two settle down .
marge simpson|i'm sure you can get another pillow .
marge simpson|i just want to relax and forget that i'm part of that thin blue line which stands between civilization and chaos .
marge simpson|bart , it's illegal for you to operate that class nine vehicle without pads and a helmet .
marge simpson|it's for your own safety .
marge simpson|don't stop talking on account of me .
marge simpson|i may be a cop , but i'm still your friend .
marge simpson|so , how are you , mrs krabappel ?
marge simpson|moe , i've never seen you here before .
marge simpson|you don't have to call me officer .
marge simpson|i'm not on duty here .
marge simpson|whoa !
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|uh , a looks nice .
marge simpson|it's a , it's a good length for you .
marge simpson|and that's the drunk tank , and this is mommy's desk .
marge simpson|look , lisa .
marge simpson|it's mcgriff the crime dog .
marge simpson|hello , lisa .
marge simpson|help me bite crime .
marge simpson|ruff , ruff .
marge simpson|illegal gambling in my house ?
marge simpson|i didn't mean to .
marge simpson|i'm still all those things .
marge simpson|only now i'm cleaning up the city , sewing together the social fabric , and unplugging the clogs of our legal system .
marge simpson|everywhere i look , someone is breaking the law .
marge simpson|dog , no leash .
marge simpson|man littering .
marge simpson|horse not wearing diaper .
marge simpson|car parked across three handicapped spaces ^
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homer , i'm on duty .
marge simpson|you have to move your car .
marge simpson|i'm gonna pretend i didn't hear that , but you have to move your car now .
marge simpson|oh , that's it .
marge simpson|i'm gonna write you a ticket .
marge simpson|you're breaking the law .
marge simpson|homer , taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense .
marge simpson|you have the right to remain silent ^
marge simpson|i'm sorry i had to arrest you , homer .
marge simpson|but what i did was right .
marge simpson|someday , when you really need it , you'll be happy there are dedicated cops like me out there .
marge simpson|i don't think that's a very good idea .
marge simpson|no , it's officer simpson of the police !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|go back to bed !
marge simpson|don't make me come up there !
marge simpson|freeze !
marge simpson|freeze !
marge simpson|every mother knows the secret entrance to her son's tree house .
marge simpson|i don't think so .
marge simpson|that the pants would rip ?
marge simpson|years of buying pants for two active children and a fullseated husband has given me a sixth sense for shoddy stitching , which these jeans have in spades .
marge simpson|that's it !
marge simpson|there's too much corruption on this force .
marge simpson|i quit !
marge simpson|bart , you've graffitotagged public property .
marge simpson|i can't believe you vandalized your own home town , bart .
marge simpson|what would jebediah springfield say ?
marge simpson|oh , homer , would you please help me make a big deal of this ?
marge simpson|well , i am just shocked by this whole family .
marge simpson|whatever happened to good oldfashioned town pride ?
marge simpson|now just a darned minute !
marge simpson|this town is a part of who you are .
marge simpson|this is a springfield isotopes cap .
marge simpson|when you wear it , you're wearing springfield .
marge simpson|when you eat a fish from our river , you're eating springfield .
marge simpson|when you make lemonade from our trees you're drinking springfield .
marge simpson|bart , you have roots in this town and you ought to show respect for it .
marge simpson|this town is a part of us all , a part of us all , a part of us all .
marge simpson|sorry to repeat myself but it'll help you remember .
marge simpson|this town is a part of us all ^
marge simpson|a part of us all ^
marge simpson|a part of us all ^
marge simpson|where you going , bart ?
marge simpson|i choose to take that literally .
marge simpson|it's almost lunch time .
marge simpson|do you know where your brother is tutoring ?
marge simpson|well , do you have a number where we can reach him ?
marge simpson|homer , come quick !
marge simpson|bart's quit his tutoring job and joined a violencegang !
marge simpson|this is my fault .
marge simpson|i tried to teach bart about town pride , but the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness .
marge simpson|isn't there anything we can do ?
marge simpson|i'm happy for the school .
marge simpson|it sounds like this money is gonna provide a lot of new opportunities .
marge simpson|i have an idea .
marge simpson|when my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye , he sent her a box of candy with his photo in it .
marge simpson|after that , she never forgot him .
marge simpson|holy christmas .
marge simpson|i must say mr burns is being awfully inconsiderate .
marge simpson|selfish , even .
marge simpson|strained carrots for maggie ^
marge simpson|strained carrots for grampa .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|put that down !
marge simpson|guns are very dangerous , and i won't have them in this house .
marge simpson|i'm going to bury it in the yard where little hands can't get to it .
marge simpson|he's causing us all to yell !
marge simpson|that's odd .
marge simpson|where's homer ?
marge simpson|and bart ?
marge simpson|and lisa ?
marge simpson|and grampa ?
marge simpson|where is everybody ?
marge simpson|i don't think we'll ever know who did this .
marge simpson|everyone in town's a suspect .
marge simpson|the police already have a suspect .
marge simpson|it's mr smithers .
marge simpson|i guess it's never the most likely suspect .
marge simpson|i think you're a little young to be investigating an attempted murder .
marge simpson|why don't you try to solve the mystery of who put that mud in the freezer ?
marge simpson|grampa , i found your cigar box dug up in the backyard , but the gun wasn't there .
marge simpson|have you seen it ?
marge simpson|i was just asking if you'd seen it .
marge simpson|there's no need to be a prickly pear .
marge simpson|were you talking to me , grampa ?
marge simpson|the police have such a strong case against homer .
marge simpson|mr burns said he did it , they have homer's d .
marge simpson|n .
marge simpson|a ^
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|no , no .
marge simpson|when i took your father's name , i took everything that came with it , including d .
marge simpson|n .
marge simpson|a .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|we can't start thinking that way about our own family members .
marge simpson|suspicion could tear us apart .
marge simpson|well , i'm just relieved that homer's safe and you've recovered and we can all get back to normal .
marge simpson|if maggie could talk i'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you .
marge simpson|besides , she didn't mean it .
marge simpson|it was an accident .
marge simpson|bart , why are you talking like that ?
marge simpson|growing half an inch in one day is still pretty good , bart .
marge simpson|here's your toast , maggie .
marge simpson|i melbafied it myself .
marge simpson|oh , lisa , honey , i tracked down those old newspapers for your history project .
marge simpson|oh , it was no trouble .
marge simpson|the hobos at the dump were very helpful .
marge simpson|except one man who seemed to have mental problems .
marge simpson|bart , it's class photo day .
marge simpson|no dracula fangs .
marge simpson|no they didn't .
marge simpson|and don't put signs on your sister .
marge simpson|now , keep the lettuce separate until 1130 .
marge simpson|that way , the lettuce stays moist and the bread stays dry !
marge simpson|eh ?
marge simpson|eh ?
marge simpson|enjoy it now , because when you're a grown up , you'll have to take care of yourself .
marge simpson|you did the right thing by telling me .
marge simpson|shoo !
marge simpson|get outta here !
marge simpson|good for a three hour getaway at the mingled waters health spa .
marge simpson|mineral bath , facial , massage ^
marge simpson|how did you afford these ?
marge simpson|homie , this is so sweet .
marge simpson|but i can't possibly go now ^
marge simpson|the sink is full of dirty dishes , the trash needs to be taken out , the living room is a mess ^
marge simpson|what about maggie ?
marge simpson|don't do that !
marge simpson|well , all right , but i'm taking some of the ironing with me in the car .
marge simpson|this is so relaxing .
marge simpson|homie , this was a wonderful idea .
marge simpson|it's like i'm on some wonderful drug !
marge simpson|what's going on here ?
marge simpson|squalid hell hole ^
marge simpson|toilet paper hung in improper overhand fashion ^
marge simpson|dogs mating on dining room table ?
marge simpson|what are you doing with my children ?
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|you can't !
marge simpson|i won't let you !
marge simpson|parents are not to communicate with children and must stay at least 100 feet away at all times ^
marge simpson|i can't believe i put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family .
marge simpson|that is so like me .
marge simpson|can you see them ?
marge simpson|that's it .
marge simpson|we're going downtown to get our kids back .
marge simpson|right now !
marge simpson|we've always tried to be good parents .
marge simpson|please , i'm begging you , one mother to another you must have a family .
marge simpson|it's maggie !
marge simpson|and then i saw my boy in a burlap sack and they told me he had lice !
marge simpson|this is so humiliating .
marge simpson|it's so quiet here without the kids .
marge simpson|i miss the way bart would say something and then say dude .
marge simpson|you mean maggie ?
marge simpson|we've never been separated from the kids for so long .
marge simpson|i don't know how much more i can take .
marge simpson|there's bart's ring !
marge simpson|well , look at the other side .
marge simpson|oh , my .
marge simpson|the only thing i'm high on is love .
marge simpson|love for my son and daughters .
marge simpson|yes , a little l .
marge simpson|s .
marge simpson|d .
marge simpson|is all i need .
marge simpson|we missed you so much !
marge simpson|he's going to baptize our children ?
marge simpson|where we going ?
marge simpson|where we going ?
marge simpson|oh , maggie , you're a simpson again !
marge simpson|so , what was it like at the flanders' house ?
marge simpson|aw , honey , you're not a monster .
marge simpson|hmm .
marge simpson|bart , what's wrong ?
marge simpson|there's something a little off about your hug .
marge simpson|uh , uh , uh , let me guess .
marge simpson|a mother can always tell .
marge simpson|hmm , it's not fear of nuclear war .
marge simpson|hmm , it's not swim test anxiety .
marge simpson|it almost feels like you're missing something .
marge simpson|something important .
marge simpson|an alligator with sunglasses ?
marge simpson|now i've seen everything !
marge simpson|street signs ?
marge simpson|indoors ?
marge simpson|whatever .
marge simpson|oooh .
marge simpson|these look good .
marge simpson|guiltfree steakfish filets .
marge simpson|ooo , tres bien .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|i think it's nice we're doing something maggie will enjoy for once .
marge simpson|besides , i'm sure storytown village is also fun for everyone ^
marge simpson|from 8 , to ^
marge simpson|god only knows .
marge simpson|this is where the wolf blows down the pigs' house !
marge simpson|that's it , honey .
marge simpson|get into the spirit .
marge simpson|you're supposed to feed them pellets from the machine over there .
marge simpson|oh my .
marge simpson|see ?
marge simpson|it was a good idea to come here after all .
marge simpson|well , it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting .
marge simpson|why thank you , homie .
marge simpson|you might say the extra ingredient is salt .
marge simpson|what's wrong lisa ?
marge simpson|didn't you get enough lamb chops ?
marge simpson|bart , sensible bites !
marge simpson|all right lisa .
marge simpson|if you don't want lamb chops , there's lots of other things i can make chicken breast , rump roast , hot dogs ^
marge simpson|you don't win friends with salad / you don't win friends with salad ^
marge simpson|i didn't mean to take sides .
marge simpson|i just got caught up in the rhythm .
marge simpson|bart , no !
marge simpson|sorry , force of habit .
marge simpson|lisa , no !
marge simpson|please pass your father the syrup , lisa .
marge simpson|tell him yourself .
marge simpson|you're ignoring lisa , not bart .
marge simpson|homer , you're not not talking to me .
marge simpson|and secondly , i heard what you said .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|where did you get that ?
marge simpson|that giant donut .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|just give him the donut .
marge simpson|once he has it , that will be the end of all this horror .
marge simpson|sometimes .
marge simpson|these monsters are destroying everything and everyone we hold dear !
marge simpson|and you kids should have jackets on .
marge simpson|homer , stop looking !
marge simpson|i don't see what that has to do with groundskeeper willie .
marge simpson|kids , it's time we told you the true story and put your fears to rest .
marge simpson|it's a story of murder and revenge from beyond the grave .
marge simpson|it all started on the thirteenth hour of the thirteenth day of the thirteenth month .
marge simpson|we were there to discuss the misprinted calendars the school had purchased .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|get ready .
marge simpson|patty and selma will be here any minute .
marge simpson|just a second !
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|where are you ?
marge simpson|do you see towels ?
marge simpson|if you see towels , you're probably in the linen closet again .
marge simpson|we better call ned .
marge simpson|he has a ladder .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|bart , no !
marge simpson|bart , what happened ?
marge simpson|oh , homie ^
marge simpson|here's your lemonade and here's your beer .
marge simpson|oh , you're such a vigorous young gogetter .
marge simpson|when's your next coffee break ?
marge simpson|hi .
marge simpson|ah , er , there's something i've been meaning to ask you .
marge simpson|did you put on a little weight this week ?
marge simpson|have you lost your mind ?
marge simpson|have you thought about your health ?
marge simpson|or your appearance ?
marge simpson|normally your father's crackpot schemes fizzle out as soon as he finds something good on tv .
marge simpson|but this season ^
marge simpson|i'd like to , honey , but i'm not sure how .
marge simpson|your father can be surprisingly sensitive .
marge simpson|remember when i giggled at his sherlock holmes hat ?
marge simpson|he sulked for a week and then closed his detective agency .
marge simpson|you're right .
marge simpson|maybe if i use my least nagging tone of voice .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|that's it .
marge simpson|that's the one .
marge simpson|all right , send him on in .
marge simpson|homer , we need to have a serious talk .
marge simpson|let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons of your controversial plan , shall we ?
marge simpson|con you're endangering your health .
marge simpson|con you're setting a bad example for the children .
marge simpson|con you're running the air conditioner nonstop .
marge simpson|it's freezing in here .
marge simpson|con i am finding myself less attracted to you physically .
marge simpson|there's no cake .
marge simpson|good .
marge simpson|good for you .
marge simpson|i'm going out .
marge simpson|i run errands during the day .
marge simpson|i'm so proud .
marge simpson|that's my husband wedged in that hatch .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|what are you talking about ?
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|that's ridiculous .
marge simpson|homer's not dead , he's right out back in the hammock .
marge simpson|a tombstone ?
marge simpson|get out of here , you ghouls !
marge simpson|oy , yoy yoy yoy yoy .
marge simpson|uh , excuse me , sir , i think there's been a mistake .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|when i asked you if that dummy was to fake your own death , you told me no .

marge simpson|i don't know what to say .
marge simpson|i finally have a motherinlaw .
marge simpson|no more living vicariously through my girlfriends !
marge simpson|she's nice .
marge simpson|i just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who abandoned you for twentyfive years .
marge simpson|you could get hurt again .

marge simpson|and they're violent and they distract you from your schoolwork .
marge simpson|tuckin time !
marge simpson|all aboard the sleepy train / to visit mother goose / barty's stop is snoozy lane / to rest his sweet caboose .

marge simpson|maybe i mother him too much .
marge simpson|here's your hot chocolate .
marge simpson|i think you're old enough to do it yourself now .
marge simpson|i didn't think you'd mind .
marge simpson|i figured you were getting a little too old for this .
marge simpson|but you can still make one .
marge simpson|there's some snow left under the car .

marge simpson|homie , you want pork chops ?
marge simpson|those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter .
marge simpson|no , i will not pay you five hundred dollars for sex !
marge simpson|it's sick !
marge simpson|and i don't have that kind of money to spend on sex !
marge simpson|maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team .
marge simpson|like mr burns .
marge simpson|for what ?
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|uhhuh .
marge simpson|ooh .
marge simpson|who knocked down the pins ?
marge simpson|good for him !

marge simpson|he's phenomenal !
marge simpson|wow !
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|where do you pick up words like that ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|watch your mouth !
marge simpson|homer , maybe mr burns will bowl a great game and you will win your championship .
marge simpson|why don't you read something ?
marge simpson|well , you could hand out these flyers for the neighborhood rummage sale .
marge simpson|you'd get some fresh air and exercise .
marge simpson|can we get rid of this ayatollah tshirt ?
marge simpson|khomeini died years ago .
marge simpson|i don't care who's consolidating their power .
marge simpson|well , we don't need this .
marge simpson|who's disco stu ?
marge simpson|are you interested in that motorized tie rack , principal skinner ?

marge simpson|you didn't vote for anybody .
marge simpson|homie .
marge simpson|as long as you keep the car full of gas , i'm happy .

marge simpson|president bush is driving on our lawn !
marge simpson|he must be lost .
marge simpson|well homer , too .
marge simpson|they're so much alike .
marge simpson|bye bye !
marge simpson|we can't afford to shop at any store that has a philosophy .

marge simpson|honey , i don't think these clothes are us ^
marge simpson|oh , it's beautiful .
marge simpson|can it be real chanel ?
marge simpson|it is .
marge simpson|90 dollars ?
marge simpson|it fits like a dream , too .
marge simpson|but we can't afford $90 even if it is a bargain .

marge simpson|you had your debutante balls and skinnydipping , and i had my home shoe repair course .
marge simpson|bart , comb your hair .
marge simpson|homer , i don't think you should wear a shortsleeved shirt with a tie .
marge simpson|if detective sipowicz jumped off a cliff , would you do that , too ?

marge simpson|i thought it was so opulent like the playboy mansion , but nonsexual .
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|they're better .

marge simpson|and it sounds like he's gotten into the horseradish again .
marge simpson|but where are we going to put him ?
marge simpson|bart's room .

marge simpson|a magical way for two people to renew their love .
marge simpson|an automatic dialer ?
marge simpson|is that legal ?
marge simpson|i don't want you getting arrested , homer ^
marge simpson|or swindling our neighbors .
marge simpson|but you're going to annoy thousands of people just to make a few measly dollars .
marge simpson|it's nothing but panhandling !
marge simpson|well , most women will tell you that you're a fool to think you can change a man ^
marge simpson|but those women are quitters !
marge simpson|when i first met your father , he was loud , crude , and piggish .

marge simpson|you've got to go back to your house .
marge simpson|something incredible has happened !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|come on !
marge simpson|i started making some calls last night , and before i knew it , practically all of springfield was offering to help .
marge simpson|the man who lived next door until his house blew down .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homer , i happen to like handicrafts much more than stuffing my face .
marge simpson|well , don't look at me ^
marge simpson|just because i'm holding a pair of scissors .
marge simpson|scissors which i need ^
marge simpson|to uh ^
marge simpson|to gussyup these curtains .
marge simpson|well , i just felt like filling the house with the rich , satisfying smell of tobacco .
marge simpson|no , homie , wait !
marge simpson|all right , i was trying to keep it from you , but i had a good reason .
marge simpson|every time you go to that cookoff , you get drunk as a poet on payday .
marge simpson|remember last year ?
marge simpson|okay , we'll go to the chili cookoff .
marge simpson|but i want you to promise me you won't have any beer .
marge simpson|mmm , i suppose i could ^
marge simpson|ooh , look at that adorable spice rack !
marge simpson|eight spices !
marge simpson|oh , some must be doubles .
marge simpson|oruhgahno ?
marge simpson|what the hell ^
marge simpson|remember your promise no drinking .
marge simpson|thank you for your concern , helen .
marge simpson|homer isn't drinking today .
marge simpson|it looks so complicated ^
marge simpson|do you know how ?
marge simpson|woowoo !
marge simpson|you promised you wouldn't drink !
marge simpson|has anyone seen homer ?
marge simpson|no beer , huh ?
marge simpson|i guess i know what a promise from homer j .
marge simpson|simpson is worth .
marge simpson|your father decided he'd rather come home in a taxi .
marge simpson|or a police car .
marge simpson|i'm cranky because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in front of the entire town .
marge simpson|you broke your promise , homer .
marge simpson|don't soul mate me !
marge simpson|oh , homer , thank goodness you're safe !
marge simpson|i woke up and you weren't there , and i was so worried ^
marge simpson|well , i was sure you'd be on foot , because you always say public transportation is for losers .
marge simpson|and i was sure you'd head west , because springfield slopes down that way .
marge simpson|and then i saw the lighthouse , and i remembered how you love blinking lights ^
marge simpson|like the one on the waffle iron ^
marge simpson|yeah .
marge simpson|we had a fight ?
marge simpson|and you're from mars .
marge simpson|homer , don't you see ?
marge simpson|our differences are only skindeep ^
marge simpson|a profound mystical understanding ?
marge simpson|space coyote ?

marge simpson|hello , can i help you ?
marge simpson|iis this about that pen that i took from the post office ?
marge simpson|ii swear i didn't know i put it in my purse .
marge simpson|then i was going to bring it back , but the dog chewed it up and that just made things worse ^
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|come .
marge simpson|come in .
marge simpson|i don't believe you , homer .
marge simpson|you're not listening .
marge simpson|you're only hearing what you want to hear .
marge simpson|homer , please !
marge simpson|i try to be supportive , but this has gone too far .
marge simpson|please just let it be .
marge simpson|please , let's just go to sleep .
marge simpson|no , i'm not .
marge simpson|these shirts are a hundred per cent cotton !
marge simpson|and look at the fine stitching on dope !
marge simpson|oh homie !
marge simpson|homie , i'm so sorry i doubted you !
marge simpson|well , you said you'd bring them peace and love and it looks like you did it .
marge simpson|i'm proud of you , homie .
marge simpson|i'm not wild about these highrisk ventures .
marge simpson|they sound a little risky .
marge simpson|i guess i'm just not comfortable with the whole idea of investing ^
marge simpson|all right , helen , if i'm not wanted , i'll leave .
marge simpson|and then they gave me back my 500 dollar investment and kicked me out of the club .
marge simpson|well , maybe it's all for the best ^
marge simpson|it would be nice to beat those women at their own game .
marge simpson|maybe i should look into a franchise .
marge simpson|well , we're trying to , but you're blocking our way .
marge simpson|now you're the one who's being naive .
marge simpson|oh , i don't want to own my own business .
marge simpson|i don't know why i came here in the first place .
marge simpson|hello , helen .
marge simpson|edna .
marge simpson|uh ^
marge simpson|oh ^
marge simpson|i'm sorry , agnes .
marge simpson|look at them .
marge simpson|they've jumped on the one franchise i might possibly have considered thinking about becoming interested in .
marge simpson|i'm not cut out for the world of business .
marge simpson|mmm ^
marge simpson|hmm ^
marge simpson|that's not bad .
marge simpson|your franchise , how much ?
marge simpson|i'll take it !
marge simpson|when can i start ?
marge simpson|what's my territory ?
marge simpson|don't forget fat people .
marge simpson|they can't stop eating !
marge simpson|hairnets , everyone .
marge simpson|welcome to pretzel wagon .
marge simpson|may i take your order ?
marge simpson|thank you .
marge simpson|excuse me .
marge simpson|i had this spot first .
marge simpson|well , i guess macy's and gimbel's learned to live side by side .
marge simpson|very well .
marge simpson|there must be dozens of great locations in this town .
marge simpson|don't you worry about me .
marge simpson|you see ?
marge simpson|a little persistence and patience paid off .
marge simpson|that'll be 300 dollars .
marge simpson|i should've said limit one per customer .
marge simpson|hang in there , baby .
marge simpson|you said it , kitty .
marge simpson|copyright 1968 ?
marge simpson|hmm .
marge simpson|determined or not , that cat must be long dead .
marge simpson|that's kind of a downer .
marge simpson|here you go free pretzel wagon pretzels for everyone !
marge simpson|one bite and you'll be hooked !
marge simpson|oh , no !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|don't do that !
marge simpson|you're supposed to be tasting them !
marge simpson|i was wrong to have a dream .
marge simpson|wrong as usual .
marge simpson|i mean , if you're nothing special , why kid yourself ?
marge simpson|listen to your mother , kids aim low .
marge simpson|aim so low , no one will even care if you succeed .
marge simpson|dinner's in the oven .
marge simpson|if you want some butter , it's under my face .
marge simpson|hello ?
marge simpson|uh , no , pretzel wagon's no longer three hundred pretzels ?
marge simpson|wait , wait , let me get this down .

marge simpson|i'll send them right out !
marge simpson|homer , homie , wake up !
marge simpson|wake up , i'm back in business !
marge simpson|are you sure the children will get enough nutrition from these pretzels ?
marge simpson|oh my god , what happened to your fingers ?
marge simpson|hey , what's going on ?
marge simpson|oh , oh , you have to push in as you turn .
marge simpson|yeah , that's it .
marge simpson|who are you ?
marge simpson|what are you talking about ?
marge simpson|homer , did you tell the mafia they could eliminate my competitors with savage beatings and attempted murder ?
marge simpson|oh , it just sickens me .
marge simpson|how could you do this to someone you love ?
marge simpson|oh , homer , i know you were trying to shield me from failure , but this is my business , and the mafia's not getting one cent of my money !
marge simpson|we're going to do what we do every day .
marge simpson|we're going to make pretzels .
marge simpson|there , that's the last one .
marge simpson|the answer is no .
marge simpson|homie , maybe we should go inside .
marge simpson|oh , i don't hate you for failing .
marge simpson|i love you for trying .
marge simpson|oh , it's just a mob war .
marge simpson|go back to sleep , honey .
marge simpson|don't worry , kids .
marge simpson|this is a national park .
marge simpson|we can have lots of fun .
marge simpson|okay , but when you start getting applecheeked , it's time to come in .
marge simpson|bart ?

marge simpson|i was thinking we could hire a nanny to help me out .
marge simpson|homie , please , i never ask for much , but this is something i really need .
marge simpson|pleased to meet you .
marge simpson|homer , if you're going to do this to every applicant , we're never going to find one .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , young man , you're not what we're looking for .

marge simpson|that's carl .

marge simpson|yes we can !
marge simpson|bart's right let's none of us have a cow .
marge simpson|all that matters is that the fans of the show liked it .

marge simpson|it's those lousy writers .
marge simpson|they make me madder than a , um ^
marge simpson|yak in heat !
marge simpson|so ?
marge simpson|oh , then i guess this is goodbye , roy .
marge simpson|maybe we'll see you in a few years ^
marge simpson|well , i never thought it would come to this , but i guess we'll have to sell grandma's civil war doll .
marge simpson|i'm sure she'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap water and plenty of warm , dry underwear .
marge simpson|oh , homer , look !
marge simpson|look !
marge simpson|a tv guide owned by jackie o .
marge simpson|yes , i have something that i'd like to sell .

marge simpson|oh , no .
marge simpson|oh , no , no , no , no .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|it's a very , very old figurine .
marge simpson|well , i guess it'll always be a monument to grandma's secret drinking problem ^
marge simpson|pimento nose ^
marge simpson|and voila !
marge simpson|mommy's patented happycracker snack platter !
marge simpson|not really .
marge simpson|they just had corn on them .
marge simpson|kitchen corn .
marge simpson|he is quite a charmer .
marge simpson|your father's certainly taken a shine to him ^
marge simpson|mmm , i don't think he's married , homer .
marge simpson|homer , didn't john seem a little ^
marge simpson|festive to you ?
marge simpson|he prefers the company of men !
marge simpson|sexual .
marge simpson|you're being ridiculous .
marge simpson|i'm very sorry you feel that way .
marge simpson|because john invited us all out for a drive today , and we're going .
marge simpson|what on earth are you talking about ?
marge simpson|homer , at least come out and say hello .
marge simpson|come on .
marge simpson|you liked john this morning .
marge simpson|oh , geez louise , you don't even know what you're worried about anymore .
marge simpson|john's a witty , urbane person .
marge simpson|i hope you all saved room , because i made your favorite dessert storebought snack cakes !
marge simpson|both kinds !
marge simpson|homie , i can hear you chewing on your pillow .
marge simpson|what's wrong ?
marge simpson|so if you wore a hawaiian shirt , it wouldn't be gay ?
marge simpson|homer , i don't think there's a problem with bart .
marge simpson|but if there is , it's probably because you're not spending any time with him .
marge simpson|goodnight .
marge simpson|i don't , but i loved hearing it !
marge simpson|homer , john brought us cactus candy !
marge simpson|oh , homer , please .
marge simpson|you're embarrassing yourself .
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|you never went hunting before , and you're perfectly straight !
marge simpson|oh , homie , i'm so glad you're safe !
marge simpson|hmmm , you feel softer than before .
marge simpson|just remember , bart , convicts aren't cool .
marge simpson|they're bad people .
marge simpson|someone should really go up there and talk to him .
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|oh , you have nothing to worry about , honey .
marge simpson|we're very proud of you , by the way .
marge simpson|but he's safely locked away !
marge simpson|for life !
marge simpson|which is impossible !
marge simpson|how can you even think of releasing sideshow bob ?
marge simpson|bart , no !
marge simpson|you can't ask god to kill someone !
marge simpson|oh , that sounds fabulous , homer .
marge simpson|stores throw the best parties .
marge simpson|you didn't remember that .
marge simpson|you just saw it on tv .
marge simpson|maybe people don't want an eightyearold babysitter , honey .
marge simpson|parents need to be sure their sitter can handle anything that might happen .
marge simpson|that's why they hire teenagers .
marge simpson|uh , grampa's not coming ^
marge simpson|actually , bart , lisa is going to be in charge tonight .
marge simpson|i know she's young , but lisa has proven herself mature and dependable .
marge simpson|well , we have to run .
marge simpson|i'm sure you kids will work things out .
marge simpson|good night !
marge simpson|make sure he brushes his teeth , lisa .
marge simpson|uh , i don't think we should be driving here .
marge simpson|the mayor's yelling at us .
marge simpson|oh , it's so beautiful !
marge simpson|this is what i imagine paris must be like !
marge simpson|i'm so honored that springfield has been chosen to host all these upscale chain stores .
marge simpson|i guess this makes us yuppies , huh , homie ?
marge simpson|oooh , malaria zone !
marge simpson|that's where all the explorers shop .
marge simpson|isn't that clever ?
marge simpson|it looks like a cadillac drove right into the building .
marge simpson|oh my god , you walked into the fountain !
marge simpson|get out of the fountain !
marge simpson|just stand still and i'll get someone !
marge simpson|young lady , you will never babysit again !
marge simpson|i am so disappointed ointed ^
marge simpson|ointed ^
marge simpson|ointed ^
marge simpson|oh , i do .
marge simpson|i'm just a little concerned about the kids .
marge simpson|maybe i should call .
marge simpson|his arm !
marge simpson|oh , my special little guy , are you okay ?
marge simpson|parades just bring out so many emotions in me joy , excitement , looking ^
marge simpson|oh , bart , we've bought those before and you always just throw them out the car window on the ride home .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|no more drinking !
marge simpson|i'm tired of looking like the world's worst mother .
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|what happened to you , homer ?
marge simpson|and what have you done to the car ?
marge simpson|i don't think it had broken axles before .
marge simpson|that's funny ^
marge simpson|i used to be able to go down there .
marge simpson|why do you have so many bowling balls ?
marge simpson|beer !
marge simpson|you're the one the papers have been talking about .
marge simpson|that mysterious beer baron who's been supplying springfield with alcohol !
marge simpson|how have you been getting away with this ?
marge simpson|homer , that's very clever !
marge simpson|well , it is .
marge simpson|i've known your father since high school and this is the cleverest thing he's ever done .
marge simpson|besides , he's only breaking a silly , twohundredyearold law ^
marge simpson|whooh ^
marge simpson|what on earth happened down there ?
marge simpson|homer , there's no point in pretending you're making those noises .
marge simpson|your homemade liquor is exploding again .
marge simpson|you've made some money and had the fun of being a wanted criminal .
marge simpson|why not quit now , while you're ahead ?
marge simpson|that was a very sweet thing you did for poor wiggum , but what's going to happen to you ?
marge simpson|wait !
marge simpson|wait !
marge simpson|you can't do this !
marge simpson|all my husband did was violate a law that doesn't make sense .
marge simpson|now , i'll admit car crashes and fist fights have been down recently , but prohibition has cost us our freedom .
marge simpson|our freedom to drink .
marge simpson|krabappel ?
marge simpson|oh , my goodness .
marge simpson|homer , bart's up there !
marge simpson|bills ^
marge simpson|bills ^

marge simpson|who or what is santos l .
marge simpson|halper ?
marge simpson|oh , bart , you didn't have to do that .
marge simpson|oh !
marge simpson|bart , where did you get all this stuff ?
marge simpson|a frying pan radio .
marge simpson|wow !
marge simpson|oh , he's so smart !
marge simpson|that's laddie .
marge simpson|bart says he won him at a church carnival , two towns over .
marge simpson|some call it the dog that never sleeps , though it actually does while jogging .
marge simpson|oh , it's against the house rule ^
marge simpson|oh , i guess just this once .
marge simpson|homer , are you wearing a tie to impress laddie ?
marge simpson|well , we wrecked the first dog .
marge simpson|we've got to treat this one right .
marge simpson|bart , why don't you take laddie for another walk .
marge simpson|besides , he's happy just hanging around the house with bart .
marge simpson|oh , maggie , you got oatmeal all over .
marge simpson|homer , would you clean her off ?
marge simpson|what's the matter , bart ?
marge simpson|weren't you happy with him ?
marge simpson|well , if that's what you think is best , let's just go down to the kennel and get santa's little helper back .
marge simpson|lisa , what in the heck are you doing ?
marge simpson|well , i think it's a great idea .
marge simpson|well , i'm sorry !
marge simpson|homer , you didn't tell me mr burns went broke and lost the nuclear power plant .
marge simpson|you told me about that candy bar you found three times !
marge simpson|they're not going to close the plant , are they ?
marge simpson|wow , he went from stinking rich to just plain stinking .
marge simpson|yeah , he's broke !

marge simpson|you'll have to face him sometime .
marge simpson|and when you do , i'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are .
marge simpson|he doesn't hate you .
marge simpson|he just feels insecure because you're getting through life so easily and it's been so difficult for him .
marge simpson|well , maybe ^
marge simpson|but i'll bet he would be less crazy if you were just a little more ^
marge simpson|professional in your work .
marge simpson|just a little more ^
marge simpson|then he won't have any reason to resent you .
marge simpson|i wouldn't bother him , honey .
marge simpson|he's making some kind of model for a contest .
marge simpson|he says it's really hightech stuff that we wouldn't understand .
marge simpson|hello , dear .
marge simpson|how was work at the plant ?
marge simpson|remember me ?
marge simpson|my name is marge !

marge simpson|you know , maybe chief wiggum is right .
marge simpson|military school is a good idea .
marge simpson|well , it certainly was nice of you to accept bart in the middle of the semester .
marge simpson|well , he sure sucked the fun out of that poem .
marge simpson|lisa , no !
marge simpson|this place is just a jail for children .
marge simpson|lisa , if you ever want to quit and come home , i'll be here in half a jiff .
marge simpson|oh , honey ^
marge simpson|i heard you the first time .
marge simpson|and don't worry , sweetie , it's very common to be homesick when you're so far away from the people who love you .

marge simpson|homer , i don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself .
marge simpson|sorry , sorry .
marge simpson|why not ?
marge simpson|oh , homer .
marge simpson|of course you'll have a bad impression of new york if you only focus on the pimps and the chuds .

marge simpson|wake up , everyone .
marge simpson|we're almost there .
marge simpson|homer !

marge simpson|if only i didn't already have a pair of shoes .
marge simpson|stay where i can see you , honey ^
marge simpson|you know , when i was a girl , i always dreamed of being in a broadway audience .
marge simpson|you better start saving now .
marge simpson|it's very expensive .
marge simpson|i hope your father had as much fun as we did .
marge simpson|we're not jumping , homer .
marge simpson|bart ?
marge simpson|why are you doing that ?
marge simpson|uh huh , that explains the flags .
marge simpson|what about the dog food ?
marge simpson|let's bake him a cake .
marge simpson|that's not a funny story .
marge simpson|not to us you're not .
marge simpson|i mean , how would you feel if you suddenly found out ned flanders was an impostor ?
marge simpson|my nextdoor neighbor ?
marge simpson|religious guy ?
marge simpson|no i don't !
marge simpson|what i mean is , to me you're just a stranger pretending to be something he's not .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , but that's just how i feel .
marge simpson|i'd sure hate to get a dozen crapweeds for valentine's day .
marge simpson|i'd rather have candy .
marge simpson|good morning , agnes .
marge simpson|how's your new son working out ?
marge simpson|and have ten items or less .
marge simpson|oh , now be fair , edna .
marge simpson|i liked armin tamzarian too , but he was at least as big a weenie as sgt .
marge simpson|skinner .
marge simpson|did you ever tell him that ?
marge simpson|i came up with the idea .
marge simpson|because the streets of capitol city are no place for three unescorted ladies .
marge simpson|because we couldn't find grampa to sit for them .
marge simpson|movies john travolta made ^
marge simpson|those were the days .
marge simpson|and you knew where you were then ^
marge simpson|coming out of my eighttrack ^
marge simpson|michael jackson still was black ^

marge simpson|could you try for a while ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|sure , honey .
marge simpson|bart had just completed his first day at school .
marge simpson|and bart just ^
marge simpson|sorry , lisa .
marge simpson|it's just how the story goes .
marge simpson|no matter what bart tried , he just couldn't fit in at school .
marge simpson|bart , would you like to read a book ?
marge simpson|would you like to color something ?
marge simpson|homer , i want you to look at this drawing bart did .
marge simpson|homer stop !
marge simpson|would you please look at the drawing ?
marge simpson|i think we're going to have to get bart some help .
marge simpson|with nowhere else to turn , we went to see the school psychologist ^
marge simpson|bart's gay ?
marge simpson|that's wonderful !
marge simpson|but still , can't you do anything for bart ?
marge simpson|look , i knew private school would be expensive but i was hoping we could get a scholarship of some sort .
marge simpson|come on , honey .
marge simpson|i guess this is a world you'll never know .
marge simpson|and sometimes i feel so smothered by this family i just want to scream till my lungs explode !
marge simpson|uh ^
marge simpson|i'll go start dinner now .
marge simpson|well , grampa , as long as you're here , we were telling a story that took place when bart was five and lisa was three .
marge simpson|yeeesss .
marge simpson|well , as if our troubles weren't bad enough , springfield was going through an unseasonable heat wave ^
marge simpson|homer , have you seen the frozen peas ?
marge simpson|uhh ^
marge simpson|you keep 'em .
marge simpson|now listen .
marge simpson|if we can't afford private school , maybe there's some other way to encourage lisa .
marge simpson|umm , an art class ^
marge simpson|ballet lessons ^
marge simpson|they have some fun things you could do at the museum on saturday ^
marge simpson|i guess it doesn't matter .
marge simpson|all these things cost money and we just don't have it .
marge simpson|unless ^
marge simpson|well , there's that two hundred dollars we've been saving for the new air conditioner .
marge simpson|i cannot believe this .
marge simpson|i'm trying to give our daughter a head start in life and you aren't helping a bit .
marge simpson|balzac !
marge simpson|please , just promise you won't buy an air conditioner till we've figured out a way to help lisa .
marge simpson|and so , just as things looked their worst ^
marge simpson|grampa , what are you talking about ?
marge simpson|as i was saying , things couldn't be worse for lisa or bart ^
marge simpson|what origin ?
marge simpson|we get 'em for a dollar ninetyfive down at the safeway .
marge simpson|you know , homer ^
marge simpson|i think we have some money in the air conditioner account again , hmmm ?
marge simpson|you're a good father .
marge simpson|homer , you know how unpredictable the french are .
marge simpson|one minute they're kissing a woman's hand , the next they're chopping off her head .
marge simpson|what if they start a war ?
marge simpson|homie , is that you ?
marge simpson|that sounds beautiful , ned .
marge simpson|and let me just say , my family and i share your vision for a better now !
marge simpson|friends with mutants , right .
marge simpson|homer , no !
marge simpson|what's going on down there ?
marge simpson|what's all this mist ?
marge simpson|oh , well , he may be a horrible freak , but he's still my son .
marge simpson|i'm sure we'll grow to accept him in time .
marge simpson|homer , stop that !
marge simpson|ohh , you want more syrup , honey ?
marge simpson|mm !
marge simpson|shoo !
marge simpson|shoo , fly !
marge simpson|they're like this every rainy day .
marge simpson|homer , what are you doing ?

marge simpson|this witch hunt is turning into a circus .
marge simpson|this is crazy !
marge simpson|i'm not a witch !
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|that's right , i'm a witch !
marge simpson|and i'm the one who withered your livestock , soured your sheeps' milk and made your shirts itchy .
marge simpson|no , that was gophers .
marge simpson|not all of them ^
marge simpson|and this is for pushing me off the cliff .
marge simpson|as for the rest of you ^
marge simpson|what a day !
marge simpson|they found out i was a witch so i had to leave my family .
marge simpson|his name is homer .
marge simpson|we're here to eat your kids .
marge simpson|candied apple !
marge simpson|i just wish we hadn't filled up on all those kids before we got to the flanders' .
marge simpson|it's hard to believe this used to be an internment camp .
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|we gotta get out of here .
marge simpson|oh my god , homer !
marge simpson|they're right next door !
marge simpson|what do you recommend ?
marge simpson|wouldn't we all suffocate ?
marge simpson|homer , we need something to protect this family .
marge simpson|homer , i don't want guns in my house !
marge simpson|don't you remember when maggie shot mr burns ?
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|no one's using this gun .
marge simpson|the tv said , you're 58 per cent more likely to shoot a family member than an intruder .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , homer .
marge simpson|no weapons .
marge simpson|homer , you can't join up with these gun nuts .
marge simpson|does anyone know where all my dinner plates went ?
marge simpson|homer , i told you this morning , no guns at the dinner table .
marge simpson|it's the same table !
marge simpson|homer , i think you'd agree that i've put up with a lot in this marriage .
marge simpson|but this is the first time since we've been married that i've actually feared for our lives .
marge simpson|so i'm asking you , if you really care about me and the children , please , please get rid of the gun .
marge simpson|i'm a lucky woman .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|you lied to me !
marge simpson|you promised to get rid of this gun !
marge simpson|how could you ?
marge simpson|of all the terrible things you've ever done in your life , this is the worst ^
marge simpson|the most despicable ^
marge simpson|until you decide what's more important your gun or your family we can't live in the same house .
marge simpson|come on , kids .
marge simpson|i've left homer .
marge simpson|so we need a place to spend the night .
marge simpson|why can't we stay here ?
marge simpson|no you're not .
marge simpson|he's really not .

marge simpson|you know , homer , it's very easy to criticize .
marge simpson|ooo , he's quite a little dancer .
marge simpson|are you wearing my selfdefense whistle ?
marge simpson|you shouldn't pressure bart like that .
marge simpson|how can you treat him that way ?
marge simpson|don't you remember how bad your father made you feel when you played sports ?
marge simpson|so like i said , i've never had a tick burrow in so deep .
marge simpson|little guy's just got a mind of his own .
marge simpson|well , at least i'm making conversation .
marge simpson|homer , please .
marge simpson|he's doing what he thinks is best ^
marge simpson|homer , mr burns can't see you winking .
marge simpson|wow , homer coaching in the championship game .
marge simpson|you must be pretty proud of your son .

marge simpson|will you please just apologize to the garbage men ?
marge simpson|oh homer , you didn't beat city hall !
marge simpson|they picked up our trash because i wrote a letter of apology to the sanitation commissioner and signed your name .
marge simpson|period .
marge simpson|you've signed my name lots of times .
marge simpson|i'm really proud of you , homie , but can the garbage man really do all the things you said ?
marge simpson|who can take this diaper ?
marge simpson|how could you spend four point six million dollars in a month ?
marge simpson|i'll have to say drugs , too .
marge simpson|good god , homer !
marge simpson|you're turning our wonderful little town into america's trashhole .
marge simpson|i can't believe it's come to this .
marge simpson|moving the whole town five miles down the road !
marge simpson|it's crazy !
marge simpson|that's what i call breakneck speed .
marge simpson|anyway , it's time for the church picnic .
marge simpson|no they didn't .
marge simpson|you just brought a bucket of chicken to church .

marge simpson|i know , honey .
marge simpson|but this is a very unusual situation ^
marge simpson|at least it would be for most families .
marge simpson|a bus ?
marge simpson|alone ?
marge simpson|absolutely not .
marge simpson|it's just too dangerous for an eightyear old .
marge simpson|in a few years , when you're old enough to drive , then you can take a bus .

marge simpson|that's the kind of faucet i want for your bathroom .

marge simpson|look at this little plastic couple .
marge simpson|mmm , so full of hopes , potential , dreams for the future ^
marge simpson|i'm going to bed .

marge simpson|ooh .
marge simpson|there's the turn !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|hope that farmhouse has a phone .
marge simpson|quick , the barn !

marge simpson|very close ^
marge simpson|ohhh .
marge simpson|my hero .
marge simpson|well , let's just say the country air did us good .
marge simpson|oh , knock it off , you perverts .
marge simpson|oh , isn't it romantic ?
marge simpson|doilies and cozies as far as the eye can see .
marge simpson|big enough for two ^
marge simpson|should we get started ?
marge simpson|hm , something's not right .
marge simpson|does this bed feel lumpy to you ?
marge simpson|what's wrong with us , homer ?
marge simpson|have we lost the spark already ?
marge simpson|heyyy , look at that .
marge simpson|oh , my heart's beating like crazy .
marge simpson|y'know , the fear of getting caught is kind of a turnon .
marge simpson|shh !
marge simpson|they'll hear us .
marge simpson|it's okay when you're in love .
marge simpson|and married .
marge simpson|to the sweetest guy in the world .
marge simpson|you don't think there's anything wrong with what we're doing , do you ?
marge simpson|oh , this is so naughty .
marge simpson|coming back to our old love nest ^
marge simpson|oh , we drank so much that night .
marge simpson|heh , heh .
marge simpson|yeah .
marge simpson|homer , a hand !
marge simpson|we're trapped !
marge simpson|we have to get out of here !
marge simpson|we've gotta get home before someone sees us .

marge simpson|wow , a lot of people have pools .
marge simpson|okay , okay .
marge simpson|here we go .
marge simpson|oh , it would have to be camera day .
marge simpson|i don't want you reading those awful scandal sheets .
marge simpson|kids , i want to explain about the stadium .
marge simpson|y'see , sometimes moms and dads get a little ^
marge simpson|well , accustomed to each other .
marge simpson|so they need to explore new ways to express their love .
marge simpson|all those eyes , just leering and leering at us .
marge simpson|i am !
marge simpson|all you're getting is rubber bands and paper clips ?
marge simpson|don't you need a notebook or something ?
marge simpson|homer , that side of bacon was for my bridge game tonight .
marge simpson|with cans of grease ?
marge simpson|i'm sure they didn't ditch you , honey .
marge simpson|maybe they went off to plan a surprise party for you .
marge simpson|my poor homie .
marge simpson|couldn't you try some other farout moneymaking scheme ?
marge simpson|you could raise some emus ^
marge simpson|lisa ^
marge simpson|i made you some homemade pepsi for the dance .
marge simpson|it's a little thick , but the price is right .
marge simpson|ohh , so you don't have a date .
marge simpson|you can still go and have a wonderful time .
marge simpson|oh , honey .
marge simpson|a baby couldn't have organized a big school dance .
marge simpson|unless it was especially skilled .
marge simpson|or one of those superbabies from brazil .
marge simpson|but they're counting on you to take tickets .
marge simpson|and if you sit there with a brave little smile and a festive bow , why , you could be the belle of the ball .
marge simpson|i have to , honey .
marge simpson|or ^
marge simpson|you can stay here and we'll have our own dance .
marge simpson|every simpson dance now !
marge simpson|bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp !

marge simpson|okay , but you've accomplished a lot .
marge simpson|you've made me very happy .
marge simpson|you're thirtynine .
marge simpson|the kids and i want to show you all the great things you've done .
marge simpson|well , there's certainly no greater accomplishment than fathering three beautiful children .
marge simpson|that doesn't sound like me .
marge simpson|well , i suppose if this doesn't work out you can always go back to the plant .
marge simpson|all right , already !
marge simpson|everyone knows the man accomplished a lot .
marge simpson|maybe because he didn't spend every waking moment talking about thomas edison !
marge simpson|well , you're not thomas edison .
marge simpson|whatever .
marge simpson|i didn't tell you to quit your job .
marge simpson|something electrical might be good .
marge simpson|oh ?
marge simpson|homer , that's not a table , that's our dryer .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|you can't punish the children just because you can't come up with an idea .
marge simpson|what happened ?
marge simpson|you didn't fall .
marge simpson|hm .
marge simpson|i brought you a tuna sandwich .
marge simpson|they say it's brain food .
marge simpson|i guess because there's so much dolphin in it , and you know how smart they are .
marge simpson|turn it off , homer .
marge simpson|that's every woman's nightmare .
marge simpson|homer , you've got it set on whore .

marge simpson|or accept them as gifts .
marge simpson|oh , dear .

marge simpson|no , of course not !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|good hustle , kid .
marge simpson|but only by two points .

marge simpson|what the dillyyo ?
marge simpson|sure you do .
marge simpson|you have the right to remain silent .
marge simpson|yeah .

marge simpson|women really like that sort of thing , homie .
marge simpson|it's not that monkey card i found in the car , is it ?
marge simpson|homer , i've gone through seven years of receipts , and you've spent less on gifts for me than you have on temporary tattoos .

marge simpson|gracias , señor .
marge simpson|oooo .
marge simpson|what a beautiful garden .
marge simpson|it's almost like paradise .
marge simpson|uh , aren't you hurt ?
marge simpson|uh , i guess .
marge simpson|speaking of ribs , is there any grub around here ?
marge simpson|well , some generalinterest magazines would be nice .
marge simpson|oh , thanks .
marge simpson|oh , how cute .
marge simpson|let's call this little guy a groundhog ^

marge simpson|yup .
marge simpson|how's your father's project coming along ?
marge simpson|homie , someone's at the door .
marge simpson|they want to talk to you about some sort of car accident .
marge simpson|is everything okay ?
marge simpson|i got worried when i didn't hear any shots .
marge simpson|you , an artist ?
marge simpson|hmm , i don't know .
marge simpson|i studied art for years , but i just don't get this .
marge simpson|no i'm not .
marge simpson|i just can't believe some people are paying hundreds of dollars for something a hillbilly pulled out of the trash .
marge simpson|homie , i'm really happy you sold your sculpture but don't you think it may have been a fluke ?
marge simpson|that's my life you're describing .
marge simpson|here he is .
marge simpson|this is where the ^
marge simpson|magic happens .
marge simpson|i'm happy for you .
marge simpson|now g'night .
marge simpson|no , homer , being an artist was my dream .
marge simpson|but now , without even trying , you've accomplished more in a week than i have in my whole life .
marge simpson|that's sweet , but , well , how would you like it if i , i don't know , entered a belching contest ?
marge simpson|you don't understand .
marge simpson|well , i guess nothing else matters as long as you're happy .
marge simpson|homer , i know you worked hard , but all of your ^
marge simpson|things were kind of the same .
marge simpson|the point is , great artists are always trying new things , like michelangelo or shaquille o'neal .
marge simpson|you just need some inspiration .
marge simpson|it's so exciting to do something cultural together .
marge simpson|a claes oldenburg .
marge simpson|he's a european who defied convention and embraced american popular culture .
marge simpson|now this is a joseph turner .
marge simpson|in an era when everyone else painted portraits , he broke away by painting the venetian canals .
marge simpson|and picasso started out painting realistically , then moved on to cubism .
marge simpson|by the end of his life , he was just painting crank letters to the editor .
marge simpson|they call it his angry jerk period .
marge simpson|any ideas yet ?
marge simpson|homer ^
marge simpson|homer ^
marge simpson|oh lord .
marge simpson|what now ?
marge simpson|oh , that can't be good .
marge simpson|homer , what have you done ?

marge simpson|are you talking to me or the beer ?
marge simpson|i'm not thinking that !
marge simpson|so , bart , how was your first day of forced volunteerism ?

marge simpson|nothing .
marge simpson|are you okay ?
marge simpson|i want you to get rid of these springs .
marge simpson|give me my baby !
marge simpson|i want these springs out of our house today .

marge simpson|oh , come on , let's go for a walk !
marge simpson|this family's getting so lazy .

marge simpson|well , we'll have to read about it in tomorrow's paper .
marge simpson|well , it's not really on our walking route ^
marge simpson|where'd you get that champagne ?
marge simpson|all this commotion just for a store ?
marge simpson|this is so much nicer than the kwikemart .
marge simpson|oh , i'm sorry , but ^
marge simpson|oh , it really is .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|don't you think you're spoiling ^
marge simpson|oh , how awful .
marge simpson|oh , i don't think mr burns would like that show .

marge simpson|i was really starting to enjoy ethnic mismatch comedy #644 .
marge simpson|i've never heard so many viagra jokes in thirty seconds .
marge simpson|mmmmm .
marge simpson|oh , i can feel the pounds just melting off .
marge simpson|lisa , would you like a penny to throw at your brother ?
marge simpson|young lady , this may be the high point of bart's life .

marge simpson|hold on , wha that's our basement ?
marge simpson|it looks so elegant .
marge simpson|and all it takes are some lace curtains and a beaded lampshade .
marge simpson|you've got to show me exactly what you did .
marge simpson|no , you weren't .
marge simpson|lisa , thank god you're okay .
marge simpson|i guess everyone has a different vision for the perfect world .
marge simpson|who's up for some beers ?
marge simpson|we were robbed ?
marge simpson|we were saving that money for our family vacation .
marge simpson|now we're gonna have to start all over again .
marge simpson|oh homer , not again .

marge simpson|not if we want that vacation .
marge simpson|thirtythree cents ?
marge simpson|i paid almost double that .
marge simpson|eww ^
marge simpson|homer , you could've just unscrewed the bottom .
marge simpson|there is for a megasavings vacation .
marge simpson|chuck garabedian says you can fly megacheap if you don't care where you go .

marge simpson|maybe we should just head back to the hotel .
marge simpson|honey , i know you want to see japan , but we're down to our last million yen .
marge simpson|be careful .
marge simpson|we need that money to get home .
marge simpson|but mr ambassador , how are we going to get home ?

marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|are you comparing yourself to our lord ?
marge simpson|ohhh , homey , is that what's bothering you ?
marge simpson|well the one sure cure for the blues is to talk it over with your life partner .

marge simpson|i wouldn't have thought of that in my wildest dreams .

marge simpson|ohhhhh .
marge simpson|oh , look at all that sweet n' low .

marge simpson|wooo !
marge simpson|wow , a fifties nostalgia cafe !
marge simpson|will you turn that engine off ?

marge simpson|no , no , i mean the dream of a good job , a loving family , and a home in the suburbs .
marge simpson|no , you don't have to kill anyone .
marge simpson|not if you have jobs .
marge simpson|and the first step is an eyecatching resumé .
marge simpson|and when you get a job interview , try not to call your employer a punk or a skank .
marge simpson|broke !
marge simpson|you broke your pencil .
marge simpson|that's right .
marge simpson|and what else have we learned ?
marge simpson|excellent , ramrod .

marge simpson|becky , what have i done here ?
marge simpson|i'm so sorry .
marge simpson|becky , i know you must feel awful .
marge simpson|but at least this didn't happen after you were married .
marge simpson|bart , remember that talk we had about you volunteering our house ?
marge simpson|now , lisa's going through this phase where she doesn't eat any meat .
marge simpson|so i usually sneak a little meat juice into her vegetables .
marge simpson|nobody's ever called my gravy yummers before !
marge simpson|ooo , ooo , i've always wanted to use rosemary in something .
marge simpson|thanks to our own spice girl becky .
marge simpson|actually , that was becky , too .

marge simpson|that's very impressive , but i still don't ^

marge simpson|yes , i hate when things get worn out ^
marge simpson|hmm ^
marge simpson|socks ^

marge simpson|what are you talking about ?
marge simpson|that was a movie .
marge simpson|becky's going to seduce homer ?
marge simpson|it is ?
marge simpson|be right back .
marge simpson|why do i always think of the perfect thing to say when it's too late shut up , becky !
marge simpson|ooh , that would've been sweet .
marge simpson|oh , no .
marge simpson|the brakes cut light .
marge simpson|why would i do that ?
marge simpson|that's crazy .
marge simpson|look , i know i don't have any proof , but this woman is trying to kill me !
marge simpson|do i have to be dead before you'll help me ?
marge simpson|usurper !
marge simpson|usurper !
marge simpson|usurper !
marge simpson|don't mess with me , i've got jimmies !
marge simpson|shut up , becky !
marge simpson|there .
marge simpson|i finally said it .
marge simpson|i thought you said the law was powerless .
marge simpson|this isn't over , becky .
marge simpson|i know where you live my house !
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|it was healthy .
marge simpson|he reciprocated .
marge simpson|he reciprocated !
marge simpson|oh ^
marge simpson|i was just praying to god that you'll find me sane .
marge simpson|oh , yes .
marge simpson|he's kind of everywhere .
marge simpson|i'm not insane !
marge simpson|i'm not insane !
marge simpson|now , let's find out who this becky really is .
marge simpson|i really should read the whole headline before i react .
marge simpson|oh , my .
marge simpson|i've been so unfair to becky .
marge simpson|maybe i am insane .
marge simpson|i mean , i am talking to myself .
marge simpson|becky , i want to apologize to you ^
marge simpson|surper !
marge simpson|why you little ^
marge simpson|shot ?
marge simpson|wha ?
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|well , then , i guess there's a reasonable explanation for everything .
marge simpson|except you cutting my brakes !
marge simpson|ooboy , my bad .
marge simpson|becky , i'm so sorry i accused you of trying to kill me and steal my family .
marge simpson|well , that's a relief , too , knowing i'm not crazy .
marge simpson|no they didn't .
marge simpson|oh , i've got too much to do to take a nap right now .
marge simpson|lisa , get maggie out of that cage .
marge simpson|and homer , since you're dressed for it , i got some s & m for ya scrubbing and mopping .
marge simpson|they told us what to wear , how to dress , which clothes we should put on ^
marge simpson|nobody told us how tough it is to raise kids .
marge simpson|they almost drove me to fortified wine !
marge simpson|the malarkeys , dumbin' it down ^
marge simpson|homer kept saying he could do a more realistic family show .
marge simpson|finally , i said , so , do it !
marge simpson|either shit or get off the pot .
marge simpson|i haven't done the laundry yet .
marge simpson|okay , the material was a little corny , but homer and i had real chemistry onscreen .
marge simpson|fortunately , i had a network connection .
marge simpson|the man who cut my hair was also president of fox .
marge simpson|we were using fiftydollar bills as toilet paper .
marge simpson|and toilet paper as dog toilet paper .
marge simpson|and just a few stars down from the cheerios honey bee .
marge simpson|i learned something when people reach for their diaphragm , they don't want to see my picture .
marge simpson|hey , you've been riding me all day .
marge simpson|why don't you poop in your hat ?
marge simpson|bart , what do you mean , you have jury duty ?
marge simpson|now homer , this is no time to be thinking about food .
marge simpson|something that swings , with the beat of new orleans .
marge simpson|swings !
marge simpson|you don't have the guts , little man !
marge simpson|stop it !
marge simpson|so , the next time you see a sheriff , shoot him ^
marge simpson|a smile .
marge simpson|good night , laughlin !
marge simpson|oh , save it for your next book , you little snitch !
marge simpson|you just don't say no to the redheaded stranger .
marge simpson|and when i heard it was for awareness , that sealed the deal .
marge simpson|which homer writes himself .
marge simpson|i can't believe it .
marge simpson|we won another contest !
marge simpson|i don't like you ogling her .
marge simpson|why don't you read cathy ?
marge simpson|she's hilarious .
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|maybe i'd better check mine .
marge simpson|today , your husband will die .
marge simpson|homer , i'm scared .
marge simpson|no dessert until you eat your broccoli .
marge simpson|poor homie .
marge simpson|i still can't believe a piece of broccoli killed you .
marge simpson|homer , it's you !
marge simpson|i thought i'd never see you again .
marge simpson|do you have to talk like that ?
marge simpson|son , i don't like you watching that fire .
marge simpson|it's too violent .
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|oh , why are the oafs always the first to go ?
marge simpson|but husband , without your weekly pittance , how shall we feed our children ?
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|you threw our precious babies into the woods ?
marge simpson|we could have sold them !
marge simpson|go back and get them !
marge simpson|well , we're still poor , but thanks to your father , we'll never go hungry .
marge simpson|but you seemed so happy in the ocean .
marge simpson|all that playful leaping .
marge simpson|geez , so many dolphins ^
marge simpson|oh honey , i wouldn't say doomed .
marge simpson|it's gonna be an adjustment , no question ^
marge simpson|the phone company ran out of numbers , so they split the city into two area codes .
marge simpson|half the town keeps the old 636 area code and our half gets 939 .
marge simpson|geez , you just have to remember three extra numbers .
marge simpson|more wheat cakes , mr mayor ?
marge simpson|that's not true .
marge simpson|outoftowner tax ?
marge simpson|all right , but this better be the best toilet paper i've ever had .
marge simpson|ooh , why didn't you say so ?
marge simpson|hey , is there a bathroom here ?
marge simpson|i don't know why , but i just didn't feel comfortable until i was back here in new springfield , with my own kind .
marge simpson|they were looking at me .
marge simpson|with their eyes .
marge simpson|we can't go on fighting with olde springfield .
marge simpson|these people are our neighbors .
marge simpson|we see them every day .
marge simpson|like the one in berlin ?
marge simpson|homer ^
marge simpson|to be honest , it's a little chilly .

marge simpson|the artist really captured jimi's passion and intensity .
marge simpson|a convict painted that ?
marge simpson|well , i studied art , and this guy's got a real gift .
marge simpson|let's get outta this goshforsaken heckhole .
marge simpson|what a waste of talent .
marge simpson|a sunset !
marge simpson|oh , nothing ^
marge simpson|how would you feel if i did some volunteer work at the prison ?
marge simpson|oh , homie .
marge simpson|i knew you'd support me .
marge simpson|mrs marge simpson .
marge simpson|i'm here to teach an art class .
marge simpson|welcome to freeing the artist within .
marge simpson|not literally , of course .
marge simpson|okay .
marge simpson|now , i wanted to paint fresh fruit , but the prison cafeteria would only give me sauerkraut .
marge simpson|that's depressing .
marge simpson|let's let a little sunshine in .
marge simpson|question ?
marge simpson|why , thank you , jack .
marge simpson|that's charming , sardonicus , but try to use less of a stabbing action and more of a brushing stroke .
marge simpson|yeah , see how much better that feels ?
marge simpson|oh jack , that's so soulful .
marge simpson|how did someone so sensitive end up here ?
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|well , you know , lots of people shoot apu .
marge simpson|it's just a hundreddollar fine now .
marge simpson|i don't see any anger .
marge simpson|i see a yearning for freedom ^
marge simpson|um , do you have a title ?

marge simpson|bart , sideshow bob says he'll be seeing you real soon .
marge simpson|oh , and guess who's up for parole ?
marge simpson|my diamondintherough .
marge simpson|scary talented .
marge simpson|and i'm gonna make sure the parole board knows it .
marge simpson|i might grease the wheels of justice with some cookies .
marge simpson|not till you finish your sundae .
marge simpson|two more bites .
marge simpson|warden , please .
marge simpson|this man is a gentle soul .
marge simpson|i know he's made mistakes , but someone with his talent belongs on a boardwalk doing caricatures .
marge simpson|not behind bars .
marge simpson|honestly , it wouldn't bother me .
marge simpson|oh , my goodness !
marge simpson|i hope this is okay .
marge simpson|it's not very prisony .
marge simpson|uh , mecca ?
marge simpson|well , let's ^
marge simpson|you remember jack ^
marge simpson|he's that talented painter who had a little brush with the law .
marge simpson|that's right , a job .
marge simpson|i know just where you can get one .
marge simpson|i read in the daily fourth gradian that you need someone to paint a mural .
marge simpson|well , jack here will do great work for you .
marge simpson|it's a small liberal arts college .
marge simpson|very lawabiding .
marge simpson|no convicts at all .
marge simpson|i know ^
marge simpson|but the lord will forgive me if it helps you get a second chance .
marge simpson|farm couple ?
marge simpson|oh , jack .
marge simpson|i know you hate to betray your artistic vision , but just do it .
marge simpson|just till you make it .
marge simpson|remember , i believe in you .
marge simpson|not until you finish your sundae .
marge simpson|what's wrong with my sundaes ?
marge simpson|oh , don't fight .
marge simpson|all great art is controversial at first .
marge simpson|but years from now , people will point to these cuddly little creatures , and say , that's a jack crowley .
marge simpson|now wait , you don't know that jack did this .
marge simpson|just because he's an excon ^
marge simpson|oh , jack ^
marge simpson|you threw it all away , over a stupid feud with skinner .
marge simpson|then why are you hiding ?
marge simpson|so you really didn't do it ?
marge simpson|i believe you , jack .

marge simpson|maggie , are your ears burning ?
marge simpson|you'll never guess what i heard in the supermarket today .
marge simpson|i found out we're the laughingstock of the town .
marge simpson|i thought our tennis court was bringing us a little respectability .
marge simpson|instead , people make fun of our lousiness .
marge simpson|all of that is you .
marge simpson|you've gotta take this more seriously .
marge simpson|that's all i ask .
marge simpson|no , it's a smooth motion ^
marge simpson|you follow through with your racket .

marge simpson|oh , i'd do anything .
marge simpson|why don't we stop this nonsense .
marge simpson|i'm not mad anymore .

marge simpson|look !
marge simpson|krusty invited us to the taping of his last episode .
marge simpson|where have you been , young man ?
marge simpson|it's nearly bedtime .

marge simpson|we can't .
marge simpson|i don't want him to see us expressing our love .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|i'm sleeping in the bathtub .
marge simpson|she's such a butthole .
marge simpson|don't be mad at homer .
marge simpson|i was the one who cut the rope .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|homer , no !
marge simpson|we're not bad parents .
marge simpson|no , i won't .
marge simpson|and frankly , judge , i think you're a bully .
marge simpson|you're so busy thinking up crazy ways to punish people , you can't see how much i love my kids .
marge simpson|i don't mean to be disrespectful , judge harm , but we are not bad parents .
marge simpson|and there isn't a tether in this world with enough fiber optics to make me say we are .
marge simpson|haven't we been humiliated enough ?
marge simpson|i just can't do that , homer .
marge simpson|it's a matter of principle .
marge simpson|and i need you to support me in this .
marge simpson|but first we gotta break out of these stocks .
marge simpson|i want goggles , too .
marge simpson|ahh !
marge simpson|if that costume shop knew we were using these burglar outfits for real , they'd be furious .
marge simpson|concentrate , homer .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|no , there it is !
marge simpson|we hate her , homer .

marge simpson|that's odd .
marge simpson|he's outside , digging .
marge simpson|there's no drugs out there .
marge simpson|bart , this is dr kaufman .

marge simpson|this has been one of the most magical evenings of my life .
marge simpson|i don't know what you said , but i'm sure it was beautiful .
marge simpson|oh homer , this is the kind of night i thought we could never have together incident free .
marge simpson|well , he would eat all the time .
marge simpson|we'd be making love , and he'd have a mouth full of hershey's miniatures .
marge simpson|and before he broke his jaw , he never listened , but now he takes to heart everything i say .
marge simpson|he did such crazy things roll clip .
marge simpson|please , homie ?
marge simpson|no more craziness for me ?

marge simpson|homer , these people are professional roasters .
marge simpson|don't give them fodder !

marge simpson|tonight , we invite both manjula and apu for dinner , but we don't tell them the other one's coming .
marge simpson|i keep telling you .

marge simpson|it's this thing !

marge simpson|here it is , this week's family activity .
marge simpson|the box says it's the perfect way to spend a day .

marge simpson|yes , homie ?
marge simpson|just go .

marge simpson|but it's also a constant battle for moral superiority .
marge simpson|so i can't apologize .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|that's not right .
marge simpson|homie , i tried to tell you how i feel , but i can't find the right words .
marge simpson|maybe he can .

marge simpson|exactly .
marge simpson|the preteen braves .
marge simpson|this is a perfect opportunity .

marge simpson|oh , isn't that sweet ?
marge simpson|even your brother's adding his kudos .
marge simpson|you were ?
marge simpson|principal skinner , can't you just reinstate those programs ?
marge simpson|lisa , what are you doing ?

marge simpson|well , couldn't you just hang some colorful crepe paper in the gym ?
marge simpson|those fudruckers !
marge simpson|oh no , they heard me .
marge simpson|which means someone lost it .

marge simpson|well ^

marge simpson|oh , forget it .
marge simpson|bart , don't waste your money on me .

marge simpson|turn , turn , keep turning , keep turning , keep turning , keep turning ^
marge simpson|what difference could it make ?

marge simpson|i guess it's just too much for me to ask for one vacation where we don't go to jail or to a condo sales pitch .
marge simpson|bart , you're not helping .
marge simpson|it's partly my fault .
marge simpson|i've been nagging you so much on this trip , you couldn't know which nags to focus on .
marge simpson|homer , you couldn't be in more trouble .
marge simpson|they're going to put your head on a pike .

marge simpson|they make the blue man group look like mummenschanz , which is still pretty good .
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|the second one wants custard , too .
marge simpson|that's a little repetitive .
marge simpson|oh no , it's raining !

marge simpson|her name is lisa .
marge simpson|and i wouldn't trade her for all the sleepin sundays and speed dating in the world .

marge simpson|i hope i can still have fun while everyone else is drinking .
marge simpson|well , i don't want to be a gloomhilda .

marge simpson|let's see how your sister's doing in the placesetting competition .
marge simpson|where were you , homie ?
marge simpson|you missed all the excitement .
marge simpson|you can tell by the way the pie tin sits on his face that he's very good looking .
marge simpson|ooh , i'll bet he's ned flanders .
marge simpson|i'm not being trampled .
marge simpson|what gives ?
marge simpson|listen ^
marge simpson|i'm married .
marge simpson|i'm looking up your nose , but i feel like i'm staring into your soul .
marge simpson|that was so exciting , yet familiar .
marge simpson|like coke with lemon .
marge simpson|oh , me too ^
marge simpson|homie ^
marge simpson|are you the pie man ?
marge simpson|well , whoever he is , the pie man would never cave in to blackmail .
marge simpson|now , on a different subject , kiss me hard .
marge simpson|i don't care .
marge simpson|i know one person who believes you were the pie man , homie ^
marge simpson|me .
marge simpson|i've known it all along .
marge simpson|no , it was clearly you in that suit .
marge simpson|you'd have to be an idiot not to see it from the start .
marge simpson|so ^
marge simpson|pie man , why don't you show me your superpowers ?
marge simpson|pie man ?
marge simpson|while you two are up on the roof , why don't you take the leaves out of the gutter !
marge simpson|stop it , homer !
marge simpson|there's only one way to settle this in simpson family court .
marge simpson|i got the idea from a nowdiscredited book on raising children .
marge simpson|your father's first kiss was in high school with me .
marge simpson|homer , that girl was me !
marge simpson|yes ^
marge simpson|and then your father broke my heart .
marge simpson|and if i'd known he was you , i never would have married you !
marge simpson|you're not gonna be kissing anybody for a while .
marge simpson|i'll start from the beginning .
marge simpson|the girls' camp was focused on teaching etiquette and deportment .
marge simpson|now that i've captured your interest , let me continue ^
marge simpson|i used to walk like this all the time ^
marge simpson|until my tendon snapped .
marge simpson|they heard it in shelbyville !
marge simpson|anyhoo ^
marge simpson|one night we had a special dinner .
marge simpson|we were learning to use all thirtythree forks .
marge simpson|i told my friends i had a date ^
marge simpson|uggams !
marge simpson|now , i'm gonna warn you kids the next part of the story gets a little wb ^
marge simpson|it was as satisfying as a million hallmark cards with all the rightsized envelopes .
marge simpson|but then your father showed his true colors .
marge simpson|so we arranged to meet again at second date rock .
marge simpson|it was years before i could trust a boy again .
marge simpson|i guess so .
marge simpson|homer , when you nurse a hurt for thirty years , it doesn't go away in an instant .
marge simpson|no , homer .
marge simpson|no , homer .
marge simpson|no , homer .
marge simpson|homie , i know this shouldn't bother me , but a girl only has one first love .
marge simpson|i guess it didn't mean that much to you .
marge simpson|i wish there was some way i could believe that .
marge simpson|oh , homie !
marge simpson|you did care .
marge simpson|i kept my heart too .
marge simpson|no , as a reminder of the hurtful things men can do .
marge simpson|but now it can have a second meaning .
marge simpson|oh , elvis .
marge simpson|how's the ice cream , kids ?
marge simpson|who's ready for a kitten ?
marge simpson|oh , you children are too suspicious .
marge simpson|it's go time .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|that hobo skeleton is not a toy !
marge simpson|now , that wasn't so bad , was it bart ?
marge simpson|you know , sometimes the fear of some ^
marge simpson|stop it , homer !
marge simpson|i think you should stay home from school tomorrow .
marge simpson|i swear bart didn't know what he was doing .
marge simpson|he was deaf !
marge simpson|if there's one way to get the truth out , it's on a cable news channel .
marge simpson|when we explain our side of the story , the hate calls will end .
marge simpson|i won't have to hear suck my such and such or hell this and bitch that ^
marge simpson|if by us you mean loudmouthed talk show hosts , which everyone seems to be in this country , then yes , i do hate americans !
marge simpson|i'll have you know i am very well liked in springfield .
marge simpson|homeland noodles with uncle sam balls ?
marge simpson|apu , aren't you going a bit overboard with the patriotism ?
marge simpson|uh oh .
marge simpson|poonam and uma are fighting !
marge simpson|i can't believe they put us in jail .
marge simpson|well , let's see , after they blindfolded us , it was left , right , left ^
marge simpson|then a three hour plane ride .
marge simpson|you were right , homie .
marge simpson|we shouldn't have rocked the boat .
marge simpson|then none of this would have ever happened .
marge simpson|i don't know why they put the real ones in with the joke ones .
marge simpson|lisa , that's not funny .
marge simpson|you believe in the bill of rights .
marge simpson|homer , we've got to get outta here .
marge simpson|okay , kids show off your pipes ^
marge simpson|wait right here for our encore ^
marge simpson|does everyone remember their swimming lessons ?
marge simpson|there's a ship !
marge simpson|we're saved !
marge simpson|oh , i've always wanted to go to france .
marge simpson|your women don't age like catherine deneuve .
marge simpson|the food is so delicious here .
marge simpson|and these chanel suits are five for a dollar !
marge simpson|i'm using a jacket as a napkin .
marge simpson|and yet , i miss america .
marge simpson|i wish we could go back , but i don't think we're welcome there .
marge simpson|i think i'm going to like this america .
marge simpson|you don't sell roadside corn .

marge simpson|yeah , well , the joke's on you , smart guy .

marge simpson|although i must admit , they know where to stop .
marge simpson|don't worry .

marge simpson|bart , where did you get those ?

marge simpson|we're only here to compare our lifestyle to our neighbors .
marge simpson|it's so beautiful and modern .
marge simpson|ooh , a subzero fridge ^
marge simpson|this is the kitchen i've always wanted .
marge simpson|ooh , a bread makermaker !
marge simpson|homie , when i married you , i knew we wouldn't live in luxury .
marge simpson|but seeing that kitchen today made me wish we had something a little better for ourselves .
marge simpson|oh , homie ^
marge simpson|that's so thoughtful , but maybe we should hire a professional contractor .
marge simpson|maybe you should turn off the power .
marge simpson|don't demolish along the way !
marge simpson|playdude magazines ?
marge simpson|have you been hiding bosom rags from me ?
marge simpson|these magazines are from before we were married .
marge simpson|maybe you should throw them away .
marge simpson|the articles , eh ?
marge simpson|so you wouldn't mind if i cut out all the erotic nudes ?
marge simpson|i'm not wearing any clothes .
marge simpson|so why don't i just splay myself on a pool table !
marge simpson|okay , here's your precious articles .
marge simpson|i think you used too much plaster .
marge simpson|i never stopped telling you .
marge simpson|i'm calling a contractor .
marge simpson|thanks for taking the job .
marge simpson|i'm sorry my husband is being so difficult .
marge simpson|when virginia woolf wrote every woman needs a room of one's own , she must have been talking about the kitchen .
marge simpson|and how 'bout a huzzah for my husband who paid for our new kitchen ?
marge simpson|great stuff , ned .
marge simpson|i guess it would be a hoot to have my face on everything .
marge simpson|bart , can you come in here for a second ?
marge simpson|in the ovenfresh bakeoff , clever presentation is as important as taste .
marge simpson|so i'm entering my dessert dogs !
marge simpson|it's deep fried cookie dough with meringue buns , cherry ketchup and caramel mustard .
marge simpson|i hope the ovenfresh bakeoff likes them as much as you do .
marge simpson|well , open it , open it , open it !
marge simpson|oh my god !
marge simpson|someone , somewhere says i'm better than someone else !

marge simpson|it's gonna be weird cooking without your tipsy father grabbing me from behind .
marge simpson|but i think i'm up to it .
marge simpson|why thank you , billy .
marge simpson|well ^
marge simpson|stuart , i'm making a dessert that looks like a hot dog , but it isn't .
marge simpson|she is not !
marge simpson|fish scales ?
marge simpson|stop !
marge simpson|you're tainting my entry !
marge simpson|you did it on purpose ?
marge simpson|why is everyone at this bakeoff such a meaniebobeanie ?
marge simpson|why can't everyone just play fair and ^
marge simpson|did you just dunk your hair in my mixing bowl ?
marge simpson|you're right .
marge simpson|if i can feed a family of five on twelve dollars a week , i can do anything .
marge simpson|i stretch your father's meatloaf with sawdust .
marge simpson|i guess i was the last one .
marge simpson|these other dishes look so pretty .
marge simpson|and those cheaters blackened my sugar wieners .
marge simpson|i'd like to give those betty crookeds a taste of their own medicine .
marge simpson|yes ^
marge simpson|medicine .
marge simpson|baby ear medicine .
marge simpson|even the pope couldn't forgive this pizza ^
marge simpson|and he's letting a lot of things slide these days .
marge simpson|don't worry , there's plenty for all of you !
marge simpson|now who's laughing ?
marge simpson|huh ?
marge simpson|huh ?
marge simpson|me !
marge simpson|i'm laughing !
marge simpson|that's an entry ?
marge simpson|i thought it was garbage .
marge simpson|what a kind yet oddly ominous thing to say .
marge simpson|now i've got to get ready for the finals .
marge simpson|well , it's not my fault !
marge simpson|lisa , the people in this bakeoff are stinkers , who pushed me and pushed me , like the pushywushies they are !
marge simpson|look , i'll be a winner with feet of clay ^
marge simpson|like mickey mantle .
marge simpson|everyone loves the mick .
marge simpson|hey , plenty of kids are gonna look up to me when i'm auntie whatever it is .
marge simpson|right now people just know me as the wife of the guy who doesn't go to work .
marge simpson|can't you understand that i need this ?
marge simpson|she's already ahead of me .
marge simpson|well , i didn't come this far not to cheat .
marge simpson|i look up to you ^
marge simpson|because you let me down .
marge simpson|that's clever ^
marge simpson|and devastating .
marge simpson|stop the competition !
marge simpson|i don't deserve to win .
marge simpson|i sabotaged all the other entries !
marge simpson|thanks , honey , for saving me from myself .
marge simpson|b .
marge simpson|f .
marge simpson|d .
marge simpson|i've had your scrambled eggs , homer .
marge simpson|the secret ingredient is whiskey .
marge simpson|that coulda been me .
marge simpson|homer , the capital of kentucky is frankfort .
marge simpson|yes , it's something , dear .
marge simpson|he sure is if he can keep up with these party animals !
marge simpson|aunt patty , aunt selma , grandma bouvier and grampa !
marge simpson|plus your schoolyard chums martin and ralph !
marge simpson|it's the best i could do on such short notice .
marge simpson|he's got the measles .
marge simpson|but we've got him on speakerphone !
marge simpson|i told him to use a land line .
marge simpson|okay gang , let's get this party started or should i say barted ?
marge simpson|for our first game , i need everyone to draw a picture of president eisenhower .

marge simpson|here's lisa !
marge simpson|she'll save the party !
marge simpson|honey , sit down ^
marge simpson|have a big slice of cake !
marge simpson|lisa , wait ^
marge simpson|it's not just the presents the kids don't appreciate me anymore .
marge simpson|they'd rather hang out with their friends than with their mom .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|no , i've got a lot more mothering left in me !
marge simpson|i'll be right here at three to pick you up , then i'll take you to the zoo !
marge simpson|we can eat fries out of a safari hat !
marge simpson|well , i guess it's just you and me , bart !
marge simpson|they grow up so fast .
marge simpson|oh sure , you love me now , but you'll turn .
marge simpson|aren't you the boy who beats up my son ?
marge simpson|those tadpoles are your lunch ?
marge simpson|here , take this .
marge simpson|my daughter didn't want the lunch i made .
marge simpson|you don't have to impress me by making fun of others .
marge simpson|i already like you .
marge simpson|it's nice to be appreciated .
marge simpson|hey , kids , i just heard they cancelled league night down at the bowling alley .
marge simpson|you know what that means open lanes !
marge simpson|whaddya say ?
marge simpson|it'll be blam !
marge simpson|bart , lisa and mom .
marge simpson|huh ?
marge simpson|fine !
marge simpson|i'll take my mothering elsewhere .
marge simpson|great roll , nelson !
marge simpson|here , i cut up your hot dog for you .
marge simpson|you've never had one before ?
marge simpson|and uh , where's your dad in all this ?
marge simpson|nelson , how'd you like to earn some extra money around our house ?
marge simpson|i have some odd jobs my kids won't do .
marge simpson|sometimes i think he's more interested in his itchy and mitchy cartoons than me .
marge simpson|that's how we got our kaypro !
marge simpson|now , i know there's a handsome young man behind all that hair and dirt .
marge simpson|well , maybe not .
marge simpson|but you did a great job on the lawn .
marge simpson|lisa , just take a bite .
marge simpson|one bite that's all i ask !
marge simpson|i didn't give your son charity .
marge simpson|i gave him selfrespect .
marge simpson|go home to your son , mrs muntz .
marge simpson|and try not to have intercourse on the way !
marge simpson|nelson , what are you doing out this late ?
marge simpson|she's still your mother .
marge simpson|come inside .
marge simpson|can i get you a glass of milk ?
marge simpson|uhhuh .
marge simpson|bart , have you ever eaten a tootsie pop ?
marge simpson|you know , there's a tough crunchy shell , but if you lick it , there's a delicious sweetness inside .
marge simpson|be nice to nelson and i'll give you a tootsie pop .
marge simpson|bart , eat up or you'll be late for school !
marge simpson|nelson , doesn't that hurt your teeth ?
marge simpson|i don't like the sound of that .
marge simpson|tomorrow i'm taking you to doctor shapiro .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|i want to hear what happened at the store !
marge simpson|well , i'm glad everything worked out so well .
marge simpson|sometimes you have to adopt your son's bully in order to bring your own family temporarily closer .
marge simpson|perhaps if you wrap it in a slice of cheese .
marge simpson|homer , that was for the dog .
marge simpson|what's that rumble ?
marge simpson|this is the most exciting scandal since the juice was on the loose .
marge simpson|she's from springfield !
marge simpson|i knew her in high school .
marge simpson|chloe sure turned out successful .
marge simpson|chloe , hi !
marge simpson|evergreen terrace .
marge simpson|terrace .
marge simpson|evergreen terrace .
marge simpson|the street that smells like pee .
marge simpson|this is my daughter , lisa .
marge simpson|well , it is good to see you , chloe .
marge simpson|would you like to come over for dinner tomorrow ?
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|well ^
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|we finally found out why the dog was scooting around on his butt all day .
marge simpson|turns out he had an impacted anal gland .
marge simpson|the excitement never stops .
marge simpson|chloe , would you like to see slides of our trip to athens ^
marge simpson|boulevard recreational center ?
marge simpson|i guess .
marge simpson|you know , chloe , some of us stayed in this town and made it a better place .
marge simpson|homer , why do you always have to show that to company ?
marge simpson|homer , what are you doing ?
marge simpson|gee , with all that travel , you probably haven't had much time to find that special someone .
marge simpson|did you just swallow another bone ?
marge simpson|that's ridiculous .
marge simpson|no one's bowl smells ^
marge simpson|it's like christmas in aspen .
marge simpson|back then , we were both stars in the thrillaminute world of high school journalism .
marge simpson|together we broke the biggest story of the semester one of the cafeteria workers was spitting in the soup .
marge simpson|when we published the story , we received the school's highest award .
marge simpson|well , we both faced a tough decision ^
marge simpson|go off to journalism school , or stay in springfield with our sweethearts ?
marge simpson|chloe left town as soon as barney proposed .
marge simpson|i would've followed her , but my plans changed when god brought me a wonderful little boy ^
marge simpson|bart , stop that !
marge simpson|why would homer write his name in grime ?
marge simpson|that's better .
marge simpson|well , i just made the bathroom floor smell like lemons .
marge simpson|where's the award for that ?
marge simpson|chloe has such an amazing life .
marge simpson|i wonder what would have happened if i'd stuck with journalism .
marge simpson|yeah , i guess .
marge simpson|that's a sweet thought , homie .
marge simpson|how dare you show my daughter a life of fun and possibility ?
marge simpson|for your information , our electric dishwasher is on the fritz .
marge simpson|not that you care about the ups and downs of my appliances .
marge simpson|do ya ?
marge simpson|huh , do ya ?
marge simpson|i'm so sick of names !
marge simpson|no one's fighting over you !
marge simpson|shiner be gone .
marge simpson|lisa , let me explain what happened tonight .
marge simpson|sometimes when your mom has half a glass of wine , she goes cuckoo bananas .
marge simpson|let me think about it .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|lisa breakfast !
marge simpson|i know you're mad at me , but i hope you're not mad at cap'n crunch ^
marge simpson|homer , we've gotta get lisa !
marge simpson|i don't see lisa in any of the seminars !
marge simpson|homer , look !
marge simpson|she's taken my daughter to an erupting volcano ?
marge simpson|that's it !
marge simpson|she is off the christmas card list .
marge simpson|we've gotta go now !
marge simpson|i'm coming , sweetheart !
marge simpson|i'll save you , lisa !
marge simpson|whoa .
marge simpson|shut up !
marge simpson|nothing's more powerful than a mother's love .
marge simpson|don't worry .
marge simpson|we've got two hours before it burns down to my head .
marge simpson|well , looking at you kids , i know i made the right choice in life .
marge simpson|this is marge simpson , reporting from lake placid where the miracle on ice never happened .
marge simpson|nooooo !
marge simpson|lousy drawer ^
marge simpson|potato masher stuck in small spoon slot ^
marge simpson|what kind of madman would do that ?
marge simpson|oh , bart , honey i'm so sorry .
marge simpson|no harm done .
marge simpson|maybe when the tooth fairy saw it was your last baby tooth , she realized you're not a little boy anymore .
marge simpson|so she gave you a grownup gift .
marge simpson|bart , someone wrote something cynical on your shirt !
marge simpson|let me wash it off .
marge simpson|well , i like tshirts with a nice joke , like support our troops .
marge simpson|we're big fans , mr gladwell .
marge simpson|what a delightful sprite .
marge simpson|homer , use your inside voice .
marge simpson|homer , i want you to get that gamma radiating what'sit out of my home !
marge simpson|i can't believe mr burns reserved the entire museum just for an office party .
marge simpson|homer , these are people you work with .
marge simpson|show some restraint .
marge simpson|i've got a bad feeling about all of this .
marge simpson|homer , that was apollo twelve !
marge simpson|now that mr burns has eliminated the drug plan , we're gonna have to cut back on our diseases .
marge simpson|i just don't see why one little pill should cost thirty dollars !
marge simpson|well , the drug company won't do anything to help us .
marge simpson|now , before we eat , let's remember what we're celebrating today after many years of hard work , your father finally paid off the mortgage .
marge simpson|stow it , you two !
marge simpson|stop making a scene !
marge simpson|what's going on here ?
marge simpson|homer , those kookoobirds at the bank goofed up and sent us a mortgage statement .
marge simpson|m631700000642j ?
marge simpson|this is a new loan tracking number you got a new mortgage ?
marge simpson|you gave the money to moe ?
marge simpson|how's he gonna pay us back ?
marge simpson|well , maybe i'll go to moe's too , seeing as i'm now part owner .
marge simpson|i would like it .
marge simpson|you never come to my mother's .
marge simpson|until you pay us back , you're answering to me !
marge simpson|and there's gonna be big changes .
marge simpson|i'm here protecting our investment .
marge simpson|i'd like you to go home and make dinner for the kids .
marge simpson|quit playing dumb .
marge simpson|come on , go home .
marge simpson|maybe some cheerier paint would make this place less of a dive .
marge simpson|well ^
marge simpson|as fabulous as your regulars are , a remodel might bring in a higher class of lush .
marge simpson|i had a feeling you'd say that .
marge simpson|so i prepared something that might help you change your tune .
marge simpson|here's my new idea to sell both beer and grub / we will turn this filthy dive into a proper oldtime british pub !
marge simpson|well , i was thinking more like drapes and a paint job , but your idea's good too .
marge simpson|thanks , moe .
marge simpson|boy , what a night !
marge simpson|moe showed me how to give someone the bum's rush .
marge simpson|here , watch .
marge simpson|get lost , rummy !
marge simpson|i know , i used to think of moe as a scabby , deadeyed hunchback .
marge simpson|but now that i've gotten to know him , we kind of bonded .
marge simpson|homer , moe and i are just work friends .
marge simpson|you and i are ^
marge simpson|marriage friends .
marge simpson|moe ?
marge simpson|what's up , partner ?
marge simpson|ooh , that's a great idea .
marge simpson|of course not !
marge simpson|i'm in bed with homer !
marge simpson|mmhmm .
marge simpson|howdy , partner !
marge simpson|why don't you sit next to us ?
marge simpson|homer , can you hold my wedding ring for a second ?
marge simpson|my finger's itchy .
marge simpson|oh , i'm too tired to talk .
marge simpson|homie , i'm tired .
marge simpson|i have to get up early to catch my flight .
marge simpson|moe and i are going to the tavern and restaurant owners convention in aruba this weekend .
marge simpson|don't you ever listen to me ?
marge simpson|i told you ten times .
marge simpson|me too , moe .
marge simpson|what a nice surprise that we've become friends .
marge simpson|moe , your upper lip is trembling .
marge simpson|moe , did you see something troubling on the tarmac ?
marge simpson|i don't know what to say .
marge simpson|that sounds like homer .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|how'd you get in here ?
marge simpson|he's right .
marge simpson|moe !
marge simpson|no i don't love you .
marge simpson|and i'm certainly not going to leave my husband .
marge simpson|i'm afraid so .
marge simpson|homie ^
marge simpson|homer , i made a vow on our wedding day , to stay by you for better or worse .
marge simpson|and besides ^
marge simpson|i love you .
marge simpson|you're my homiewomieromiedomie ^
marge simpson|moe , i need to tell you something .
marge simpson|you showed me you could be a really sweet guy .
marge simpson|you can make a woman very happy some day .
marge simpson|it's true .
marge simpson|you'd be quite a catch ^
marge simpson|if you'd just shower and shave and stop swearing under your breath .
marge simpson|really ?
marge simpson|is it one that will change the sleeping arrangements ?
marge simpson|goodnight , both of you .
marge simpson|who's watching the kids ?
marge simpson|i agree .
marge simpson|hey !
marge simpson|aren't you that crazy cat lady ?
marge simpson|those are just reese's pieces .
marge simpson|i know how to save this park i'm gonna organize a charity carnival !
marge simpson|god , that junior league burns me up .
marge simpson|everyone seemed so happy , but i'm surprised at ned .
marge simpson|he left out all the good times cain and abel had when they were growing up .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|how do you know these things ?
marge simpson|lisa , could you pass the salad ?
marge simpson|who wants to help me clear the table ?
marge simpson|oh my .
marge simpson|ned's next movie seems even bloodier than the last one .
marge simpson|i can't take any more !
marge simpson|ned , there's more to the bible than blood and gore .
marge simpson|well , i don't like this movie .
marge simpson|and i'm going to boycott your financier ^
marge simpson|mr burns .
marge simpson|solar .
marge simpson|oh homie , don't worry .
marge simpson|i'm sure you'll come up with a great idea .
marge simpson|billions !
marge simpson|just poke through .
marge simpson|time for homer's halftime show .
marge simpson|get ready , frank .
marge simpson|homie , i think you did great .
marge simpson|and to celebrate , i made omelets from the eggs people threw at our house .
marge simpson|dissin' ?
marge simpson|do rappers still say that ?
marge simpson|baggy britches ?
marge simpson|looselaced gym shoes ?
marge simpson|are you going to a rap performance ?
marge simpson|all too well .
marge simpson|rap music belongs in the rubbish bin .
marge simpson|it encourages punching , boastfulness , and rudeness to ho's .
marge simpson|well , you are not going to any concert that promulgates stink talk .
marge simpson|oh did he ?
marge simpson|homer , you tell your son a rap show is not a safe place for a tenyearold !
marge simpson|don't argue with marge , i know what's best / the only rap in this crib , keeps sandwiches fresh !
marge simpson|that little sneak disobeyed us and went to that hiphop festival !
marge simpson|we have kidnapped your son .
marge simpson|follow instructions and bart will not be harmed .
marge simpson|thanksgiving's not for months .
marge simpson|ooh , what a horrible thing to say to a mother .
marge simpson|it's win a hawaiian getaway week on channel six .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|please give me back my boy !
marge simpson|i just want to tell him i love him one more time .
marge simpson|oh bart , i'm so glad you're okay .
marge simpson|excuse me , reverend .
marge simpson|as long as two people love each other , i don't think god cares whether they both have the same hoohoo or haha .
marge simpson|which book ?
marge simpson|but reverend ^
marge simpson|scriptural scholars disagree on the significance for christians of many of the old testament's proscriptions .
marge simpson|jesus' teachings stressed inclusiveness and compassion ^
marge simpson|homer , you married every gay couple in town .
marge simpson|don't you push them !
marge simpson|they've gotta work that out for themselves .
marge simpson|straight .
marge simpson|but veronica's a girl's name .
marge simpson|did you know that ?
marge simpson|oh homie , i'm so proud of you .
marge simpson|you stood up for people's right to express love in its most perfect form , a binding legal contract .
marge simpson|you're getting married ?
marge simpson|patty , that's wonderful !
marge simpson|so tell , tell .
marge simpson|who's the lucky man ?
marge simpson|what does he do ?
marge simpson|let me guess does he work in customer support ?
marge simpson|oh no .
marge simpson|no no .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i'm just ^
marge simpson|surprised .
marge simpson|so patty .
marge simpson|you're a woman who likes women .
marge simpson|i guess that fear i always had of you stealing homer away is unfounded .
marge simpson|well , i guess i could have seen the signs .
marge simpson|oh no .
marge simpson|oh no .
marge simpson|why would it be ?
marge simpson|i love you and i love gay marriage , so i'd be a superhypocrite if i didn't love your gay marriage .
marge simpson|right ?
marge simpson|because she's bringing over someone very special .
marge simpson|her fiancée .
marge simpson|actually your aunt is marrying a very lucky ^
marge simpson|woman .
marge simpson|so veronica , what do you do ?
marge simpson|no surprises there .
marge simpson|whoa !
marge simpson|save something for your wedding night .
marge simpson|i don't think it's exactly what mom would want .
marge simpson|of course .
marge simpson|everyone should do whatever they want .
marge simpson|take a bear to church !
marge simpson|read a book with your feet !
marge simpson|change your name to goobleglop !
marge simpson|i just can't believe my sister would keep me in the dark all these years , then expect complete acceptance on the day she gets married .
marge simpson|the toilet seat's up !
marge simpson|but that wouldn't happen unless ^
marge simpson|she's a man !
marge simpson|looks like patty's gonna get something she didn't register for .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|i can't let this happen !
marge simpson|patty , it's not what you think .
marge simpson|veronica is a man !
marge simpson|well , i've learned a lesson .
marge simpson|just because you're a lesbian , it doesn't make you less of a bein' .
marge simpson|grampa , you're a greet grater !
marge simpson|i mean a great greeter !
marge simpson|now look who's senile !
marge simpson|i'll take a cart .
marge simpson|lisa , you took out a restraining order against your own brother ?
marge simpson|i always hoped we wouldn't be one of those restraining order families .
marge simpson|please lift this restraining order , judge harm .
marge simpson|it's poking our family apart .
marge simpson|bart , lisa went over to janey's .
marge simpson|quick , run inside and go potty !
marge simpson|lisa , don't you think your brother's suffered enough ?
marge simpson|he's done good things for you too .
marge simpson|he brought home your homework when you were sick .
marge simpson|well , let's count that anyway .
marge simpson|it's a natural process that women of a certain age go through .
marge simpson|selma , i never realized you wanted a child so badly .
marge simpson|don't cry , sweetie .
marge simpson|everything's gonna be all right .
marge simpson|wait till the drambuie and sleeping pills kick in .
marge simpson|go , go , go !
marge simpson|homer , if you do this one small favor , it could transform selma's life .
marge simpson|do it for me .
marge simpson|thank you , mr simpson .
marge simpson|homer , no stop !
marge simpson|you're thinking of buckingham palace !
marge simpson|mind your manners , lisa .
marge simpson|selma , she's beautiful !
marge simpson|homer , of all the sneaky , dishonest things you've ever done , playing selma's husband was by far the sweetest .
marge simpson|okay , one quick snuggle .
marge simpson|hold still , homie .
marge simpson|just think about the day you found that junior mint in your bellybutton .
marge simpson|plus , we get free apple , orange and grapefruit juice !
marge simpson|is there anything more fun than a nice sunday drive ?
marge simpson|hey , hey , it's krusty the clown !
marge simpson|what do you say , krusty ?
marge simpson|always nice to see him .
marge simpson|he's cleaning out the garage .
marge simpson|i can picture it now ^
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|oh , thank god !
marge simpson|he's alive !
marge simpson|honey ^
marge simpson|your nearfatal boo boo today really scared me .
marge simpson|what would the kids and i do if something happened to you ?
marge simpson|you keep almost dying .
marge simpson|just look at our vacation photos .
marge simpson|homie , if you die , i'm gonna have three kids to take care of .
marge simpson|i want you to buy some life insurance .
marge simpson|please ?
marge simpson|you don't smoke !
marge simpson|i'm not gonna worry just because homer doesn't have insurance .
marge simpson|a lot of people don't !
marge simpson|oh , this is only based on a story .
marge simpson|a true story !
marge simpson|we need to start saving !
marge simpson|go easy on that it's gotta last 'til you're five .
marge simpson|that's right .
marge simpson|it's much less expensive than the leading clownbased cereal .
marge simpson|you just have to assemble it yourself .
marge simpson|we saved fifty cents on that purchase !
marge simpson|oh , we're just saving for ^
marge simpson|a very rainy day .
marge simpson|well , i just think we should be building a nest egg .
marge simpson|i have a book from the library with the same information !
marge simpson|no more directory assistance !
marge simpson|it's not free !
marge simpson|no more oriental mustard !
marge simpson|can you help me unload this soup from the car ?
marge simpson|there was a sale , so i bought four hundred cans .
marge simpson|oh honey , i know it's not easy , but we've got to put money away .
marge simpson|don't you think you've had enough fun ?
marge simpson|oh please .
marge simpson|from what i hear , you waltz in there at 1030 , take a nap on the toilet , then sit around googleing your own name until lunch .
marge simpson|you shouted it while we were making love !
marge simpson|now look here , mister .

marge simpson|hey , it's only money .
marge simpson|and it did make a cool splash .
marge simpson|which came first , turkey the bird or turkey the you guys ?

marge simpson|i wrote that letter .
marge simpson|well , aren't you ?
marge simpson|i'm so excited .
marge simpson|it's like giving birth to a child of steel and iron .

marge simpson|the next piece is an atonal medley by philip glass !

marge simpson|and that could be you !
marge simpson|because you're the prison snitch !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homer , where are you ?
marge simpson|as president of the cultural board i was given a key to the concert hall .

marge simpson|he's from springfield , i think you know him ^
marge simpson|the one what ?
marge simpson|you mean get beaten up by him ?
marge simpson|and i'll admit , it is kinda romantic under the sea .
marge simpson|homer , do something about this leak !
marge simpson|you know homer , i let a lot of things slide , but when you can't keep a roof over your family's head , you're just not much of a father .
marge simpson|that teddy bear survived three safety recalls , but it couldn't survive you !
marge simpson|it's raining inside !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|i woke up to find an owl eating a mouse on the pillow next to me .
marge simpson|it means you have to fix the roof !
marge simpson|knockers on route 98 .
marge simpson|i'm psychic .
marge simpson|look , i don't know if i want a roofer who hangs out in bars .
marge simpson|well , he better highfive our roof !
marge simpson|come on , kids !
marge simpson|we're gonna visit grampa .
marge simpson|then we're gonna take the dog to the vet ^
marge simpson|then take bart to get circumcised .
marge simpson|i'll tell you what it means when it's over .
marge simpson|okay kids , we only have time for a quick visit to grampa , so as soon as he feels loved , we're outta there .
marge simpson|oh , he must smell leftovers .
marge simpson|well , he does seem happy here ^
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|you're drooling on my goodwill pile !
marge simpson|and why is the hole in the roof even bigger ?
marge simpson|it's after six he's not coming back .
marge simpson|he's a lousy roofer and a flake !
marge simpson|i don't want to hear any more about ray .
marge simpson|tomorrow morning you buy some shingles and fix that roof yourself .
marge simpson|you're not married to ray !
marge simpson|yeah , i bet the old people will be acting like young people , like in those cell phone ads everyone hates .
marge simpson|he's become one of them !
marge simpson|hey boy , want a treat ?
marge simpson|we better get you home .
marge simpson|come on , lisa .
marge simpson|geez louise ^
marge simpson|how you feeling , sweetie ?
marge simpson|what are you doing ?

marge simpson|i'm so sick of hearing about that stupid , unreliable ray !
marge simpson|who , by the way , i've never even met !
marge simpson|homer , how did you think i'd feel when i saw that ?
marge simpson|homer , come down for dinner .
marge simpson|ray's not coming !
marge simpson|homer , i know where ray is .
marge simpson|sweetheart , your friend ray is in your head .
marge simpson|you have to understand ray doesn't exist .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homer , no one has ever seen ray but you .
marge simpson|i called that bosom bar .
marge simpson|the bartender said you were there alone .
marge simpson|electroshock ?
marge simpson|i see ray too .
marge simpson|when did i agree to that ?
marge simpson|you didn't validate my parking .
marge simpson|wait , there's still one last thing that doesn't make sense .
marge simpson|why did you start fixing our roof and then just disappear ?
marge simpson|that's right you're all crooks !
marge simpson|bart , i spent all afternoon stuffing tuna fish into that steak .
marge simpson|have some .
marge simpson|oh , so i've been replaced by a machine ?
marge simpson|well until that day , i'm still bart's mother , and i don't like him stuffing himself with junk .
marge simpson|oh , fine .
marge simpson|his liver looks healthy .
marge simpson|doctor , you're a pediatrician !
marge simpson|i talked to dr hibbert today .
marge simpson|he gave me a list of heartsmart foods .
marge simpson|cottage cheese !
marge simpson|aw honey , please take this seriously .
marge simpson|when people used to ask me how you were doing , i said at least he's got his health .
marge simpson|now you've got nothing !
marge simpson|nothing !
marge simpson|for me , please try a healthy vegetable .
marge simpson|okay , now we know you're allergic to cauliflower .
marge simpson|but i made a special platter of vegetables that are good for you .
marge simpson|it's graffiti you can eatie !
marge simpson|they're not kidnappers !
marge simpson|they're professionally trained childsnatchers , who are taking you to a maximumsecurity fat camp .
marge simpson|fortyseven ?
marge simpson|don't you mean tough love ?
marge simpson|jimminy kimmel !
marge simpson|look how much they're charging for bart's treatment !
marge simpson|i already use crayons for lipstick , and fireplace soot for eyeliner .
marge simpson|this fat camp can save bart's life we have to find a way to pay for it .
marge simpson|homer , maybe you could ask mr burns for a raise .
marge simpson|bart , what are you doing here ?
marge simpson|but ^
marge simpson|you're still fat !
marge simpson|to give these germans das boot ?
marge simpson|jawohl !
marge simpson|no you didn't .
marge simpson|i was hoping we'd miss the three o'clock holdup .
marge simpson|i don't know what to do for dinner now .
marge simpson|vegetables , you've been promoted from side dish to entrée .
marge simpson|bart , don't use that word ^
marge simpson|oh crap .
marge simpson|don't worry about the competition , sweetie .
marge simpson|whenever i enter a contest i tell myself i'm going to win because , sometimes , if you believe hard enough , god cuts you a break .
marge simpson|after all , he works for us .
marge simpson|our prayers pay his salary .
marge simpson|lisa , that sounds like a fancier version of the song you're going to sing !
marge simpson|but your song said you liked springfield .
marge simpson|sweetie , tonight you were perfect ^
marge simpson|homie , i'm worried you're turning into some kind of super kookoo stage mother .
marge simpson|bart , you wanna go to the video arcade ?
marge simpson|actually , i think your father's still upset about the way things went down .
marge simpson|hey , kids !
marge simpson|i scream , you scream , we all scream for ^
marge simpson|haircuts !
marge simpson|you have ?
marge simpson|that's so nice !
marge simpson|a kids' barbershop ?
marge simpson|but they don't have my templates .
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|i see .
marge simpson|well , good luck getting to your precious mall barber , 'cause i'm not driving you .
marge simpson|i guess i'll just cut my own hair .
marge simpson|sweetie , don't worry .
marge simpson|god wouldn't spring the rapture on us unannounced .
marge simpson|he'd send us signs , like , i don't know , all the dogs getting on a spaceship and leaving .
marge simpson|ooh , i could be the rachel to your jacob .
marge simpson|here's a pretty little wig for lisa , and a handsome toupee for bart !
marge simpson|so , you still think i'm crazy for saving all your hair trimmings ?
marge simpson|okay then .
marge simpson|let's get the rest of this hair back in the freezer .
marge simpson|homer , you didn't touch your second dinner tonight .
marge simpson|and you're reading books !
marge simpson|word books !
marge simpson|what's going on ?
marge simpson|may eighteenth ?
marge simpson|that's one week from today !
marge simpson|homer , i'm glad you're getting exercise , i just wish it wasn't crazy exercise .
marge simpson|the stars are falling to the earth !
marge simpson|just as you predicted .
marge simpson|lisa's going !
marge simpson|we're all going !
marge simpson|i'm so proud of you , homie !
marge simpson|homie ^
marge simpson|i'd better start dinner .
marge simpson|we're not going anywhere , except to bed !
marge simpson|you couldn't predict six o'clock at five thirty !
marge simpson|now good night !
marge simpson|the worst part is i'll never see my homie again !
marge simpson|the warren harding throughhole never seemed so long .
marge simpson|but we don't have a sitter for maggie .
marge simpson|a tv shark is not a babysitter !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|honey , you can be anything you want to be .
marge simpson|what language is this ?
marge simpson|gibbygabby ?
marge simpson|bart , don't make fun of grad students they just made a terrible life choice .
marge simpson|ned , let me give you a little something for babysitting .
marge simpson|you've got a big house , ned .
marge simpson|if you need extra money , why don't you rent out a room ?
marge simpson|what are you two doing ?
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|turn away from that screen and look out the window !
marge simpson|it's happening in ned's house !
marge simpson|why would he allow that ?
marge simpson|c'mon .
marge simpson|you tell him right now .
marge simpson|ned , homer has something to tell you .
marge simpson|you know what i mean .
marge simpson|well , homer , you've driven away the best neighbor a family could ever want .
marge simpson|but at least we have a chance to start fresh so let's be on our best behavior , okay ?
marge simpson|that's coming from next door !
marge simpson|bart , get your things .
marge simpson|you're leaving with me !
marge simpson|bart , i love you .
marge simpson|but sometimes i don't love your choices .
marge simpson|now we have to find another school for you .
marge simpson|bart , this could be a good new school ^
marge simpson|oakwood academy !
marge simpson|huh ?
marge simpson|think of the leg up you'd have !
marge simpson|what if there's a fire ?
marge simpson|how 'bout this one st .
marge simpson|jerome's catholic school ?
marge simpson|bart , i'm glad you had fun , but i wouldn't get too into that catholic church .
marge simpson|with all the sitting and standing and kneeling , it's like simon says without a winner !
marge simpson|don't you touch bead one !
marge simpson|homer , maybe we should be concerned .
marge simpson|catholics can be a peculiar bunch no birth control , no meat on friday ^
marge simpson|let's just change the subject .
marge simpson|bart , would you like to say grace ?
marge simpson|homer , you've been out all night !
marge simpson|and you look like you've accepted someone as your personal something .
marge simpson|were you at that catholic church ?
marge simpson|i knew they'd try to convert you !
marge simpson|that's what they do !
marge simpson|well i'm not having another twelve kids .
marge simpson|forget it !
marge simpson|and you know , i went to a catholic wedding once .
marge simpson|the incense ruined my pantsuit !
marge simpson|well , homer and bart are well , they're under the weather .
marge simpson|all right !
marge simpson|i admit it they're both at the catholic church !
marge simpson|reverend , what should i do ?
marge simpson|i guess it's good that they're taking an interest in spirituality .
marge simpson|where's homer and bart ?
marge simpson|i wish my family was with me .
marge simpson|well then , i'd like to speak with jesus .
marge simpson|noooo !
marge simpson|first communion ?
marge simpson|homer , you're physically an adult , and what you do in the privacy of your own soul is your business .
marge simpson|but i didn't change bart's diapers for five years to see him become a catholic .
marge simpson|let's go !
marge simpson|they weren't following us .
marge simpson|i just don't think your father's the right person to pick out a religion for you .
marge simpson|hello , homer .
marge simpson|it wasn't a fair fight !
marge simpson|your church suckered him in with gory stories , just like we were suckered into getting cinemax .
marge simpson|well , i'm gonna show bart that protestants can be hip too .
marge simpson|how do you like those croutons ?
marge simpson|now bart , isn't this the kind of religion you'd like to be a part of for all eternity ?
marge simpson|what's wrong , bart ?
marge simpson|you love youth culture !
marge simpson|oh bart , i knew one of these dumb things would work !
marge simpson|my hive !
marge simpson|my trademark hive !
marge simpson|why would we want to go to santa's village ?
marge simpson|it's august .
marge simpson|homer , before i take the kids , i want you to swear you're not up to something .
marge simpson|and i'd also like to know why your hand is in that cast .
marge simpson|frosty !
marge simpson|where's your magic top hat ?
marge simpson|my christmas present to myself this year was leaving that place early .
marge simpson|look , i know this wasn't the greatest outing , but your father meant well , so don't let him know that we didn't .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|is this a snuggle film ?
marge simpson|how could you allow this , in the room where we ^
marge simpson|do puzzles ?
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|away from you .
marge simpson|i don't know .
marge simpson|you are .
marge simpson|bye bart !
marge simpson|i love you , lisa !
marge simpson|sleep tight , maggie !
marge simpson|today's the last day you can eat the yogurt in the fridge !
marge simpson|can he swim ?
marge simpson|i guess i'd better tell them i'm coming home .
marge simpson|i'm at a rest stop south of springfield .
marge simpson|i know , you're sorry now .
marge simpson|then you'll buy me some kwikemart flowers , maybe a box of candy where half the pieces mysteriously have testing bites , and a week later you'll be back to your old thoughtless self .
marge simpson|i love you too ^
marge simpson|hold on , i'll be off in a minute .
marge simpson|listen , buster .
marge simpson|i had to buy a club soda i didn't want to get change for this phone !
marge simpson|an oogliboogli !
marge simpson|i'll call you back !
marge simpson|well what if by harming a manatee you could save two manatees ?
marge simpson|but before you answer , consider this the manatee you'd have to harm is pregnant .
marge simpson|i think the worst part was when i realized that homer lied to me .
marge simpson|exactly !
marge simpson|maybe you could just put a hat on him and say it's a trick .
marge simpson|huh .
marge simpson|and treated like i deserve .
marge simpson|okay , water monsters .
marge simpson|be friendly .
marge simpson|but not too friendly .
marge simpson|what do i do ?
marge simpson|okay .
marge simpson|uh ^
marge simpson|you know , up close you're kinda cute .
marge simpson|aw , you're a good thing .
marge simpson|i know it .
marge simpson|let me clean out your ears .
marge simpson|i've bonded with him !
marge simpson|where is he taking me ?
marge simpson|i've got my groove back !
marge simpson|i can't believe how many manatees we saved today .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|ooo .
marge simpson|homie , i accept your apology .
marge simpson|but i'm not coming back yet .
marge simpson|i've found a place where i'm needed .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , homie .
marge simpson|i just can't find it in my heart to come back right now .
marge simpson|oh , my sweet , sweet homie !
marge simpson|you sacrificed yourself for the manatees .
marge simpson|i'm gonna take you home and fix you up , 'cause you're the real endangered species ^
marge simpson|a devoted husband .
marge simpson|and i always will .
marge simpson|don't you have to be back at work ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|do something about the noise !
marge simpson|well , they just can't start building in our neighborhood without asking us .
marge simpson|what ever happened to please and thank you ?
marge simpson|we have to stop all this construction .
marge simpson|the noise is jiggling my grapes to the bottom of the jello .
marge simpson|instead of a stamp museum we'll be next door to a graveyard ?
marge simpson|this is a little too spooky for me .
marge simpson|i don't even like watching the count on sesame street .
marge simpson|go back to your own country !
marge simpson|oh sure you can , sweetie .
marge simpson|just don't make a habit of it .
marge simpson|so that's why i've been smelling margaritas at three a .
marge simpson|m .
marge simpson|lisa , honey .
marge simpson|i know last night was tough , but all our kids sleep by themselves .
marge simpson|we don't even hear maggie cry at night anymore !
marge simpson|oh , wait a minute .
marge simpson|there's no batteries in this thing .
marge simpson|tonight i want you to really try to sleep in your own bed , because ^
marge simpson|homer , stop that !
marge simpson|noooo !
marge simpson|homer , can you help me out here ?
marge simpson|isn't this lenny's house ?
marge simpson|lisa , do you really want to watch this ?
marge simpson|what a lousy party .
marge simpson|i don't care what apu was in a past life .
marge simpson|in this life , he's a blabbermouth !
marge simpson|look who's sleeping in our bed again .
marge simpson|i spy with my little eye , a girl who's not sleeping in her room like she promised .
marge simpson|homer , we're not really playing .
marge simpson|what if we show lisa we can sleep in her room without being frightened ?
marge simpson|hm ?
marge simpson|well , i hope he's accompanied by the how was your day monster , and the foot rub monster and the let me just ^
marge simpson|lisa , honey .
marge simpson|any chance you can stop reading soon ?
marge simpson|we need professional help .
marge simpson|frankly , no .
marge simpson|lisa kind of took care of herself .
marge simpson|our oldest , bart , was such a handful .
marge simpson|homer , stop that !
marge simpson|four thousand dollars ?

marge simpson|we're having alcohol drinks , and dishing on the parents who aren't here .

marge simpson|i barely recognized you without your costume on .
marge simpson|i never heard anything about it on the gossip shows , or the blogosphere or in my supermarket checkout magazine .
marge simpson|homer , can i see you in the kitchen ?
marge simpson|homie , i don't think our marriage is so jim dandy that we should be counseling others .

marge simpson|buck , i guess we can help you out .
marge simpson|we'll start tomorrow !
marge simpson|buck , tabitha , welcome .

marge simpson|we are out of the marriage counseling business .
marge simpson|and the only one you should be giving chicken grease neck rubs to is me .
marge simpson|but not me , 'cause i think they're disgusting .
marge simpson|then i guess you'll do it without me .
marge simpson|crossed arms mean no .
marge simpson|tabitha , what a coincidence i was just thinking sad thoughts about you !
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|no !

marge simpson|don't give up on buck .
marge simpson|there must be something about him that attracted you in the first place .
marge simpson|let's go .
marge simpson|leave him alone !
marge simpson|all he did was try to help a young couple find their way .
marge simpson|does he really deserve to get strung up for that ?
marge simpson|cut that out !
marge simpson|weren't you just tied up in the blimp ?
marge simpson|marriage is hard work .
marge simpson|but it's worth it when you've got someone wonderful like i do .
marge simpson|i hope you're happy , bart .
marge simpson|thanks to your hijinx , i have to drive you and your friends to school .

marge simpson|homer , our house is on fire !
marge simpson|help me save the children !
marge simpson|homer , where did you get that truck ?
marge simpson|homer , helen lovejoy never returned my casserole dish from the church potluck .
marge simpson|could you pick it up ?

marge simpson|what are those noises ?
marge simpson|they sounded zoological !
marge simpson|see , lisa .
marge simpson|we're making progress .
marge simpson|i'm very happy for you , bart .
marge simpson|if we can't find a home for those animals , they'll be put to sleep .
marge simpson|your sister's very upset .
marge simpson|honey , what you're feeling is called empathy .
marge simpson|empathy means you're looking at lisa , and feeling what she feels .
marge simpson|your sister poured her heart into rescuing those animals to forget the pain of being upstaged in jazz .
marge simpson|and now ^
marge simpson|you could do something nice for lisa .
marge simpson|ooh !
marge simpson|a j .
marge simpson|c .

marge simpson|someone at your school has a lifethreatening peanut allergy .
marge simpson|the letter doesn't say .

marge simpson|homie , don't you want to build something with your new fixit books ?

marge simpson|oh , the floorboard broke my nightstand .
marge simpson|i did it !
marge simpson|what's that strange feeling ?
marge simpson|it's of accomplishment !

marge simpson|perfect !
marge simpson|i'm here to fix your bookcase .
marge simpson|you answered my flyer .
marge simpson|that's right .
marge simpson|it's so unfair i'm as handy as any man .
marge simpson|i guess people just expect their carpenter to be some fat guy with his butt crack showing .
marge simpson|homer , your butt just gave me a brilliant idea !
marge simpson|a dash of glue , a turn of screw , and a gazebo's built that's perfect for two or more !
marge simpson|uhoh , switch !
marge simpson|i help more than you might think .
marge simpson|this is shirley .
marge simpson|yes , fine , he'll be there tomorrow .
marge simpson|goodbye !
marge simpson|homie ^
marge simpson|i think you're taking a little too much credit for my work .
marge simpson|i mean , look at your tshirt !
marge simpson|i guess i don't .
marge simpson|why does lenny need a windmill anyway ?
marge simpson|switch , switch , switch .
marge simpson|homer , it's time people knew the truth i'm doing the work and i want the credit .
marge simpson|you're gonna have to fix that roller coaster yourself , 'cause i quit ^

marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|you won't eat my stuffed peppers , but you'll eat our son ?

marge simpson|the cure to any man's problems is a good relationship .
marge simpson|cylinders ?

marge simpson|the martians are only killing humans , so we should pretend to be animals !
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|our son joined the army !
marge simpson|now listen , bub .
marge simpson|you go down to those recruiters and tell them bart is too young for the army .
marge simpson|i don't want this to be the only memory i have of him .
marge simpson|i think she just answers their phone ^
marge simpson|homer , with all the things you've done go into space , attend clown college , join the navy i never thought you'd join the army !
marge simpson|homie , don't do this you have a wife and three young children at home .
marge simpson|so they're not shipping you overseas ?
marge simpson|i'd give anything to hear homer's voice .
marge simpson|it's not giant and it's not in the distance !
marge simpson|it's small and it's in our room !
marge simpson|don't worry .
marge simpson|i have a secret weapon one more powerful than any gun .
marge simpson|a phone tree .
marge simpson|hello , helen ?
marge simpson|i'm calling about the recent destruction of our town .
marge simpson|well , i have a little plan to fix their wagon .
marge simpson|we're going to dump it in the water to get the army drunk .
marge simpson|colonel , we're here to discuss the terms of your surrender .
marge simpson|don't you dare go limp !
marge simpson|all right , but no combat .

marge simpson|we're going to the senior olympics to root for grampa !
marge simpson|kids , grab a fold .
marge simpson|what's with the lined composition book ?
marge simpson|seventytwo lousy events , and grampa hasn't won a single medal .

marge simpson|dear pus bag ^
marge simpson|see .
marge simpson|lisa , i'm sorry you got a bad grade on your moe and tell .
marge simpson|homer , don't drink and drive !
marge simpson|lisa , grab your sightseeing shoes !
marge simpson|we're going vermonting !
marge simpson|that's so wasteful .
marge simpson|oh , you should be ashamed !
marge simpson|your father works very hard to put lobsters on our table .
marge simpson|every night , he comes home exhausted , with his voice too hoarse to talk .
marge simpson|all those women are so impressive .
marge simpson|i've been doing the same thing for the last ten years .
marge simpson|and all i have to show for it is a clean floor .
marge simpson|my legashe !
marge simpson|i'm glad someone in this house feels their life has meaning .

marge simpson|no to your manipulation !
marge simpson|and a big fat no to the kingsbridge school district !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|this is so exciting watching a movie outside with the whole town .

marge simpson|homer , that's too much sugar !

marge simpson|homer , this is wonderful .

marge simpson|he's good at opening jars .
marge simpson|three years is a long ways away .
marge simpson|my husband is out there !

marge simpson|you killed my husband !
marge simpson|we were together for five years !
marge simpson|now who's gonna take care of the triplets ?
marge simpson|for me , huh ?
marge simpson|what took you so long ?

marge simpson|come on , kids .
marge simpson|so you see homer , revenge only leads to misery .
marge simpson|weren't you listening ?
marge simpson|i just told you a whole story about revenge .
marge simpson|you should feel lucky .
marge simpson|not many boys have parents who can afford to take them to the opera every night .
marge simpson|this alley looks dangerous .
marge simpson|i'd better turn my ring around .
marge simpson|hooboy .
marge simpson|shut up !
marge simpson|hm ^
marge simpson|what's the matter , sweetie ?
marge simpson|aw , grampa .
marge simpson|we should take lots of pictures of him while we still can .
marge simpson|homer , is that you ?
marge simpson|lisa , it was wonderful !
marge simpson|i am such a proud hitachee mother .

marge simpson|f .
marge simpson|y .
marge simpson|i .
marge simpson|, she's pregnant !
marge simpson|i did !
marge simpson|okay , we can trace where the kids are by the charges they made on your card .
marge simpson|in colorado , they charged two hundred dollars worth of bubble gum .
marge simpson|dingle's berries in provo , utah ?
marge simpson|then that must be it .
marge simpson|stop the wedding !
marge simpson|bart , you're too young to get married !
marge simpson|you still make me check the closet for the boogeyman !
marge simpson|homer is so amazing !
marge simpson|he can chug a beer and pitch woo at the same time .
marge simpson|oh yes .
marge simpson|i'm so proud , i feel my chest might burst .
marge simpson|can you edit that ?
marge simpson|i don't wanna say chest in a movie .
marge simpson|oh , yes sir ^
marge simpson|as shocks go , this one's a real zaparoo .
marge simpson|oh ^
marge simpson|well , yeah , the ointments , um ^
marge simpson|mr burns , we're so sorry .
marge simpson|the plan was just to use your back yard , and the next thing we know , mr smithers is tied up in a grandfather clock .
marge simpson|what do you want ?
marge simpson|we let you in thirtytwo years ago and it's brought us nothing but pain .
marge simpson|no , no , no , no , no !
marge simpson|let's not get crazy .
marge simpson|wait just a cottonswabbing minute !
marge simpson|a good man went to a lot of trouble just to impress you !
marge simpson|and i went along with it , because i love him to pieces !
marge simpson|and you made him look like a fool .
marge simpson|well , i don't want you anywhere near my house !
marge simpson|now you can cut !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|don't kill the foreign man !
marge simpson|oh , homie !
marge simpson|you make each eightyear interval better than the last !
marge simpson|nothing like reading a wellplotted mystery on the beach .
marge simpson|it's amazing how they always solve the crime just before they run out of pages .
marge simpson|james patterson !
marge simpson|ooh , how about little bo peep ?
marge simpson|i overslept !
marge simpson|the family can't start the day without me !
marge simpson|homie , you woke up early ?
marge simpson|dr swanson , i'm bart's mother .
marge simpson|i've been saving this money for my husband's breast reduction surgery .
marge simpson|but i think this is more important .
marge simpson|would you please see bart again ?
marge simpson|bart , honey , this is all we can afford for now .
marge simpson|if it doesn't work , maybe when you're an adult you can pay some lady to make you happy for an hour .
marge simpson|you redid the basement !
marge simpson|'you look at that paneling i feel like i'm back in wooden times !
marge simpson|this basement is a wonderful gift to the family .
marge simpson|but how could you afford it ?
marge simpson|shut up !
marge simpson|it's an instructional website !
marge simpson|shut up !
marge simpson|nothing like untossing a leftover salad .
marge simpson|it'll be like new !
marge simpson|what the heck are these ?
marge simpson|grampa's driving me crazy !
marge simpson|can we at least get out of the house for an evening ?
marge simpson|i invited selma here to watch grampa watch the kids .
marge simpson|look at grampa and selma frolicking in the water .
marge simpson|yeah , and the great prices at that new rib joint were the surprise of the evening .
marge simpson|be nice , homer .
marge simpson|don't you see how great it is that they found each other ?
marge simpson|like how the parts of a pig nobody wants combine to make a yummy hot dog .
marge simpson|nothing solves everything forever like a wedding .
marge simpson|oh , i don't know , he might come home any minute .
marge simpson|i don't think we're doing this right .
marge simpson|it's okay , homie .
marge simpson|you're probably just tired from not doing anything all day .
marge simpson|this disasterette was a real wake up call .
marge simpson|we need to find a way to protect our irreplaceables !
marge simpson|okay , everyone gets to put one precious item in our fireproof safe .
marge simpson|for me , it's the family photo album .
marge simpson|now we have nothing to worry about in the event of a fire except our lives .
marge simpson|nooooo !
marge simpson|it's gone !
marge simpson|that family album was a record of my accomplishments it's like what a résumé is for a man .
marge simpson|restage the photos ?
marge simpson|okay , we're recreating our series finale party for star trek voyager .
marge simpson|our new photos are back !
marge simpson|that's why i got duplicates !

marge simpson|anyway , i was growing to admire my professor more and more ^
marge simpson|homer's perfect for me !
marge simpson|just look at this note i miss you .
marge simpson|aww ^
marge simpson|whatever , homer and i had the wrenching task of dividing up a shared life ^
marge simpson|unfortunately , as i later learned , that wasn't heroin .
marge simpson|it was insulin .
marge simpson|homer really did need those injections .
marge simpson|homer , stop !
marge simpson|you don't have to tell the kids everything !
marge simpson|well that professor did teach me one good lesson homie is where my heart is .

marge simpson|your lack of bedroom pizzazz last night started me worrying .
marge simpson|so i hired this nutritionist , betsy bidwell .

marge simpson|searching for evidence .
marge simpson|i know your father's cheating on his diet .

marge simpson|out of the house , kids !
marge simpson|i have to make an adult phone call .
marge simpson|go , go , go , go , go !
marge simpson|this is my husband ^
marge simpson|i think he's been sneakering on his diet .
marge simpson|i didn't use to mind it when he'd lock the bathroom door and snack off , but when he's getting it regular , night after night after night ^
marge simpson|i'm sorry i'm so emotional .
marge simpson|so , how was your outside time ?
marge simpson|that quick talking is never a good sign .
marge simpson|it's four o'clock on a saturday .
marge simpson|the load is on the road .
marge simpson|what's up ?
marge simpson|homer jay simpson !
marge simpson|zack , you're not trying to help our marriage , you're trying to split us up !
marge simpson|i'd rather have a chubby hubby than a sexy exy !
marge simpson|aw marge , if there was a reality show called fat guys who really love their wives , not only would it be an enormous ratings success , but i'd be the first one on it .
marge simpson|a ballet academy here in springfield ?
marge simpson|move over , europe !
marge simpson|lisa , have i ever shown you my shattered dreams box ?
marge simpson|it's upstairs in my disappointment closet .
marge simpson|there were so many things i wanted to do in life that i never got a chance to do doctor , safecracker , stethoscope sales lady ^
marge simpson|none came to pass .
marge simpson|but the thing i really wanted to be , ever since i was little , was a ballerina !
marge simpson|my bosoms came in and ruined my balance .
marge simpson|they came in one at a time .
marge simpson|no , i'm pretty sure you'll have your dad's boobs .
marge simpson|wait , you mean she danced well , into her seventies ?
marge simpson|or she danced , well into her seventies ?
marge simpson|i think you've got a point !
marge simpson|homie , i'm gonna be a dancer !
marge simpson|boring !
marge simpson|look , lis !
marge simpson|i'm as supple as ever !
marge simpson|it won't go down !

marge simpson|of course you're lisa .
marge simpson|lisa the dancing marge girl .
marge simpson|oh homie , i've been so happy lately .
marge simpson|i'm completely fulfilled , both as a mother and a fan of youth ballet !
marge simpson|now what did you want to say to me ?
marge simpson|there's nothing that makes a mother's heart soar more than seeing her child take wing .
marge simpson|look at me , i'm glowing !
marge simpson|homie , lisa's dancing has made me really , really , happy .
marge simpson|who was that ?
marge simpson|and i realize it's wrong to try to live your career dreams through your children .
marge simpson|i'm taking you to your home , before you wreck mine !
marge simpson|you live here ?
marge simpson|well , at least she's got a friend .
marge simpson|get in !
marge simpson|are you calling me fat ?
marge simpson|listen , i'm sorry i called you all those mean things like , oh , i don't even remember ^
marge simpson|she turned down lenny ^
marge simpson|and carl ?
marge simpson|that's like someone who doesn't like hamburgers or hotdogs .
marge simpson|what could make her hate men like that ?
marge simpson|so that's it .
marge simpson|she's been burned by the most important man in her life ^
marge simpson|her father .
marge simpson|lurleen lumpkin has a hole in her heart , and i'm gonna fill it .
marge simpson|i've talked to over five hundred men named lumpkin ^
marge simpson|everyone at lumpkin , lumpkin and rosenthal associates , an asian or pacific islander named cho lum kin ^
marge simpson|but still no sign of lurleen's dad !
marge simpson|hello , are you royce lumpkin ?
marge simpson|the father of lurleen lumpkin ?
marge simpson|she's thirtyfour , and she's having a rough time !
marge simpson|she needs to see you right away !
marge simpson|i made that hug happen !
marge simpson|no suicide axe !
marge simpson|my body wash is estée lauder ^
marge simpson|i'm really worried about lurleen .
marge simpson|and major marge !
marge simpson|lurleen , you're giving your dad too much power over the way you feel about yourself .
marge simpson|stop getting your selfesteem from the men in your life .
marge simpson|uh , yeah ^
marge simpson|there's only one person in the world who can tell you what to do .
marge simpson|and that person is right here !
marge simpson|no , no , that's just our old christmas decorations .
marge simpson|yes !
marge simpson|it's time for you to take control of your own destiny .
marge simpson|you're not a doormat , you're a door prize !
marge simpson|well , you're very welcome , lurleen .
marge simpson|of all the women who've hit on homer over the years , you're my favorite .
marge simpson|if you ever come near homer again , i'll strangle you with your own hair extensions .
marge simpson|that's right , i know .
marge simpson|every week we have to buy something else to save that transforming clown that morphs !
marge simpson|i want you to watch a show that isn't just one long commercial !
marge simpson|you two have been bombarded with enough commercial images !
marge simpson|lisa , i've got a big bunch of black bananas .
marge simpson|you know what that means ^
marge simpson|and bart , you go with your father to shelbyville to get the beanbag chairs rebeaned .
marge simpson|honey ^
marge simpson|we'd love to , but ^
marge simpson|a prizewinning bull is thousands of dollars .
marge simpson|we're putting a stop to this right now !
marge simpson|all right , i've got an idea but it'll take a lot of sewing .
marge simpson|stop the wedding !
marge simpson|bart is a tenyearold boy .
marge simpson|he still sits in the driveway and pretends to drive the car .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , bart .
marge simpson|but sometimes your mom knows best .
marge simpson|sweetie , don't you think your mom might have a trick up her sleeve ?
marge simpson|trust me .
marge simpson|roger that .
marge simpson|okay , have fun at the laughter house .
marge simpson|now i'll just turn off my phone to save the battery .
marge simpson|okay lisa , i'm turning my phone back on to see if your father is ready to be picked up .
marge simpson|huh , i have over four hundred text messages .
marge simpson|lisa , honey , just because you're a girl doesn't mean you can't join in the fun .
marge simpson|maggie and i are washing the soiled foam fingers .
marge simpson|lisa , what are you doing ?
marge simpson|i love documentaries !
marge simpson|especially the one that came with our lawnmower .
marge simpson|although it was suspiciously prolawnmower .
marge simpson|homie , she's not making a snuggle film .
marge simpson|ooo , regularsville .
marge simpson|sounds like my kind of place !
marge simpson|ooo , candyland .
marge simpson|a great family game is now a great family movie !
marge simpson|i get it every title means the opposite of what it means !
marge simpson|then i bet i'll love chernobyl graveyard !
marge simpson|i didn't .
marge simpson|we never get more than one move into this game .
marge simpson|thank you , dear .
marge simpson|lisa , how could you ?
marge simpson|sweetie , i'm usually your number one fan .
marge simpson|but , call me oldfashioned , i usually don't like movies that humiliate my family in front of the world .
marge simpson|thank god they're not jeering at us anymore .
marge simpson|no more simpsons movies !
marge simpson|one was plenty !
marge simpson|we know you love us , honey even though sometimes you show it in a quirky way .
marge simpson|we listened to music radio in the car ^
marge simpson|and , since you kids behaved , we'll pick one fun thing to do here .
marge simpson|for once , we'll do what maggie wants .
marge simpson|none of you kids ever remember any of the nice things we do for you .
marge simpson|food ?
marge simpson|shelter ?
marge simpson|clothing ?

marge simpson|i think someone broke in !
marge simpson|homie , what's going on ?
marge simpson|come on , homie your mom wouldn't have wanted you to stay in bed forever .
marge simpson|say something comforting .
marge simpson|homer , look what i found with your mother's things .
marge simpson|maggie , that's the same garry that filmed your birthday party .
marge simpson|remember , he brought his girlfriend and they got in a fight .
marge simpson|hmm , it smells like concerts !
marge simpson|excuse me , i think i'm holding up better than you are .
marge simpson|in fact , i've got energy to spare .
marge simpson|my purse is made of hemp if we burn it , the silly smoke will mellow out those guards !
marge simpson|i thought she gave you her rebellious spirit .
marge simpson|homie ?
marge simpson|it doesn't work that way , homie .
marge simpson|my son's a goodforsomething !
marge simpson|it's clown trouble .
marge simpson|that's your responsibility .

marge simpson|oh my god !
marge simpson|this is an erotic bakery !
marge simpson|how could you not tell me this is an erotic bakery ?
marge simpson|marge , calm down .
marge simpson|for as long as there's been baking , there's been erotic baking .
marge simpson|it fills a need , and harms no one .

marge simpson|you , me and the cake ?
marge simpson|don't feel too bad , homie .
marge simpson|you'll be free tomorrow .
marge simpson|and i used all my new baking skills to make a special cake to remind you of me .
marge simpson|sweetie , we can't afford to get you a cell phone .
marge simpson|as it is , i'm buying frozen peas on installments .
marge simpson|that laughter sounds like the result of misbehavior .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|how did you get a cell phone ?
marge simpson|whose phone is this ?
marge simpson|okay .
marge simpson|milhouse ?
marge simpson|you did the right thing .
marge simpson|bart simpson's stolen cell phone can i help you ?

marge simpson|okay , here goes .
marge simpson|bart , i have something for you !
marge simpson|well , sweetie ^
marge simpson|i know i said you couldn't have a cell phone , but , in these days of stranger dangers and sinister ministers , i think it's important that we're in touch .

marge simpson|okay , bart went to the comic book store .
marge simpson|bullies !
marge simpson|that's a hard hat zone !
marge simpson|bartholomew j .

marge simpson|look at bart go !
marge simpson|he must be running away !
marge simpson|oh my god , he's out of frame !
marge simpson|zoom out !
marge simpson|zoom out !
marge simpson|he's circling the shelbyville bird sanctuary .
marge simpson|bart's been moving nonstop all afternoon .
marge simpson|maybe there's too much sugar in his sugarfrosted candy o's .
marge simpson|pull over bart's in this field !
marge simpson|are we ever going to find him ?
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|where are you , bart ?
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|all i care about is finding my boy .
marge simpson|and then i'm never letting him out of my sight again ^
marge simpson|those walls do look safe .
marge simpson|oh my god .
marge simpson|you've taught me a valuable lesson !
marge simpson|so i can't always be there for bart .
marge simpson|he's got to learn to take care of himself .
marge simpson|i think it's time for us to go home .
marge simpson|thank god you're okay !
marge simpson|we were gone for two weeks !
marge simpson|i just made a thirtyseven hundred mile car trip .
marge simpson|i need to wash up .
marge simpson|hmmm , all the groceries seem to have been balled up in anger .
marge simpson|now homer , boys will be boys .
marge simpson|where's bart ?
marge simpson|we're gonna be late for lenny's party .
marge simpson|bart simpson !
marge simpson|did you just spray water on me ?
marge simpson|dang that bart !
marge simpson|thanks to him , i have to wear my backup dress which makes my arms look fat .
marge simpson|why can't our son just behave ?
marge simpson|that was unforgivable .
marge simpson|but i'm beginning to think that bart's bad behavior is more than just a phase .
marge simpson|no flicking boogers , and no driving into trees !
marge simpson|wow , lenny went all out !
marge simpson|bart , i've had it with you !
marge simpson|i'm taking away all your tv privileges .
marge simpson|okay , then videogames .
marge simpson|no more nondice board games .
marge simpson|i just did .
marge simpson|i made it with cheetos , just like you like it .
marge simpson|if the sauce is too thick , i can add more root beer .
marge simpson|maybe he's going through ^
marge simpson|certain changes .
marge simpson|homer , it's not a real paper it's a rubber chew toy !
marge simpson|bart , honey , i saw you didn't like your dinner , so i thought you might like pepperoni pizza with the crust cut off .
marge simpson|now let me tuck you in , fluff your pillow and sprinkle a little fairy dust to keep the monsters away .
marge simpson|it's cinnamon !
marge simpson|nightienight , sweetheart .
marge simpson|scrubbing you / is easy 'cause you've been prerinsed / and when you're covered with goo / that's when i'm scrubbing you !
marge simpson|/ scrubbubbubbubbub / scrubbubbubbubbub ^
marge simpson|i don't like the look of those air quotes .
marge simpson|now , we tuck in the tummy , the tushy and the tootsies .
marge simpson|homie , let's pick up those hitchhikers .
marge simpson|they don't look like the stabby kind .
marge simpson|i said they were thrillcrazed drug seekers .
marge simpson|don't put words in my mouth !
marge simpson|aw ^
marge simpson|young love .
marge simpson|of course we were .
marge simpson|i don't know ^
marge simpson|well , we thought we'd wait a little while .

marge simpson|homer simpson , i would be delighted not to marry you .
marge simpson|homer , that was rude and shortsighted .
marge simpson|patty and selma have the map .
marge simpson|that's the fuel gauge .
marge simpson|you haven't said you're sorry .
marge simpson|can we use your phone ?
marge simpson|we'll stay for one hand roll or two nigiri then we have to get back to the kids !
marge simpson|that's how low you can go !
marge simpson|why are you dancing with that strange woman ?
marge simpson|well then she can have you all to herself !
marge simpson|homer simpson , i wish i'd never met you !
marge simpson|they have a pedal car .
marge simpson|there's absolutely nothing to worry about !
marge simpson|i'm in my own room , being chaperoned by an actual christian .

c. montgomery burns|i'm afraid not my primitive friend .
c. montgomery burns|your kind has neither the cranial capacity nor the opposable digits to operate a firearm .
c. montgomery burns|the one who shot me was ^
c. montgomery burns|ma .
c. montgomery burns|maggie simpson !
c. montgomery burns|with the sun blocker in place and the town aghast , i was on top of the world ^

c. montgomery burns|that's the one .
c. montgomery burns|smithers had thwarted my attempt to take candy from a baby , but with him out of the picture , i was free to wallow in my own crapulance .
c. montgomery burns|i think you'd better drop it !
c. montgomery burns|but the old exhume was misleading .
c. montgomery burns|taking the candy proved exceedingly difficult .
c. montgomery burns|i said drop it !

c. montgomery burns|but finding only slacked jawed gawkers , i gave up and collapsed on the sundial .
c. montgomery burns|what ?
c. montgomery burns|no !
c. montgomery burns|with my last ounce of strength i sucked out my gold fillings and swallowed them .
c. montgomery burns|those paramedics have sticky fingers .

c. montgomery burns|you know , smithers , i think i'll donate a million dollars to the local orphanage ^
c. montgomery burns|when pigs fly !

c. montgomery burns|and is he a constant disappointment ?
c. montgomery burns|does he bring home nitwits and make you talk to them ?
c. montgomery burns|fascinating .
c. montgomery burns|goodnight .
c. montgomery burns|i'll tell you what's with me the humiliation of having a coarse , boorish , ignoramus for a son !
c. montgomery burns|your son has been kidnapped ^
c. montgomery burns|i can't believe someone would kidnap my larry .
c. montgomery burns|i won't rest until he's returned to me !
c. montgomery burns|it's the principle , smithers !
c. montgomery burns|nobody steals from montgomery burns , whether it be my sunday newspaper or my loutish oaf of a son .
c. montgomery burns|ahoyhoy ?
c. montgomery burns|yes !
c. montgomery burns|i'm missing one son !

c. montgomery burns|oh , how much proof do you need ?
c. montgomery burns|five thousand ?
c. montgomery burns|six thousand ?
c. montgomery burns|i swear , that's all i've got .
c. montgomery burns|more important than money ?
c. montgomery burns|who is this ?
c. montgomery burns|the negotiations have failed !
c. montgomery burns|shoot him !
c. montgomery burns|i should've known .
c. montgomery burns|you're the only one stupid enough to kidnap you .
c. montgomery burns|now get down here so i can spank you in front of this gawking rabble .
c. montgomery burns|smithers , take off my belt .
c. montgomery burns|there , there , sonnyboy .
c. montgomery burns|i suppose i have been a bit ^
c. montgomery burns|oh , no , i can't do it .
c. montgomery burns|it's just not me .
c. montgomery burns|i'm sorry , larry , i can't be the family that you need .
c. montgomery burns|well , son , delighted to have met you .
c. montgomery burns|it's good to know that there's another kidney out there for me .
c. montgomery burns|i don't like being outdoors , smithers .
c. montgomery burns|for one thing , there are too many fat children .
c. montgomery burns|smithers ?
c. montgomery burns|ahoyhoy ?
c. montgomery burns|hmm .
c. montgomery burns|one dollar for eternal happiness ^
c. montgomery burns|mmmm , i'd be happier with the dollar .
c. montgomery burns|so , another friday is upon us .
c. montgomery burns|what'll you be doing , smithers ?
c. montgomery burns|something gay , no doubt .
c. montgomery burns|you know , lighthearted .
c. montgomery burns|fancy free .
c. montgomery burns|mothers lock up your daughters , smithers is on the town !
c. montgomery burns|hello children !
c. montgomery burns|i bring you love !
c. montgomery burns|la la la la la ^
c. montgomery burns|uh , i'll field that question .
c. montgomery burns|a lifetime of working in a nuclear power plant has given me a healthy green glow and left me as impotent as a nevada boxing commissioner .
c. montgomery burns|and now that i'm back to normal , i don't bring you peace and love .
c. montgomery burns|i bring you fear , famine , pestilence , and ^
c. montgomery burns|good morning star shine / the earth says hello .
c. montgomery burns|come on , come on , while we're young .
c. montgomery burns|no , the promise of a new day is more than enough exhilaration for me .
c. montgomery burns|smithers , coffee ^
c. montgomery burns|ah !
c. montgomery burns|we need some excitement around here !
c. montgomery burns|no , no , something fun .
c. montgomery burns|something the men will enjoy like a safety drill !
c. montgomery burns|but what kind ?
c. montgomery burns|eh , meltdown alert ?
c. montgomery burns|mad dog drill ?
c. montgomery burns|blimp attack ?
c. montgomery burns|ah , i think a good old fashioned fire drill today .
c. montgomery burns|is it supposed to take this long ?
c. montgomery burns|what's a good time for a mass evacuation of the entire plant ?
c. montgomery burns|and what's our time so far ?
c. montgomery burns|damnation !
c. montgomery burns|what kind of slowcoaches do i have working for me ?
c. montgomery burns|ah , here comes one of our fellows now .
c. montgomery burns|yes , you won all right .
c. montgomery burns|you won more than you bargained for .
c. montgomery burns|what a disgraceful display .
c. montgomery burns|i've seen more orderly behavior in a ritz brothers film .
c. montgomery burns|you all need a serious lesson in teamwork .
c. montgomery burns|all right .
c. montgomery burns|let me start off by telling you this will not be a walk in the park .
c. montgomery burns|this will be the most arduous and backbreaking weekend of your life .
c. montgomery burns|i cannot overemphasize the dangers which ^
c. montgomery burns|did you bring your family , simpson ?
c. montgomery burns|imbecile .
c. montgomery burns|simpson , your family will have to remain here .
c. montgomery burns|now as an added incentive , the second to last team to arrive at the cabin will receive an hilarious world's worst employee trophy .
c. montgomery burns|and the last team to arrive will be fired .
c. montgomery burns|and to show that i'm not playing favorites , both smithers and i will be participating .
c. montgomery burns|who knows ?
c. montgomery burns|i might be the unlucky one who gets fired .
c. montgomery burns|not bloody likely .
c. montgomery burns|woooohoooo !
c. montgomery burns|/ huzzah !
c. montgomery burns|yes , well , frankly , you've been a bit of a pill lately .
c. montgomery burns|prepare for the adventure of a lifetime as you fight for survival against the merciless forces of nature !
c. montgomery burns|toe your marks , get set , go !
c. montgomery burns|ready , mr burns ?
c. montgomery burns|one moment .
c. montgomery burns|why , thank you , simpson .
c. montgomery burns|i have been watching my figure .
c. montgomery burns|tell me , simpson , if an opportunity arose for taking a small shortcut , you wouldn't be averse to taking it would you ?
c. montgomery burns|neither would i .
c. montgomery burns|i've always felt that there's far too much hysteria these days about socalled cheating .
c. montgomery burns|mmmhmm .
c. montgomery burns|if you can take advantage of a situation in some way , it's your duty as an american to do it .
c. montgomery burns|why should the race always be to the swift or the jumble to the quickwitted ?
c. montgomery burns|should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts god gave them ?
c. montgomery burns|well , i say , cheating is the gift man gives himself .
c. montgomery burns|excellent .
c. montgomery burns|and to do so , i propose we travel by ^
c. montgomery burns|horseless sleigh .
c. montgomery burns|yes , well , i'm older than you .
c. montgomery burns|you know , simpson , you're not as objectionable as you seemed when we first met .
c. montgomery burns|we made it , old friend !
c. montgomery burns|we have several hours before the others arrive .
c. montgomery burns|what say we get comfy ?
c. montgomery burns|now we have electricity .
c. montgomery burns|this propane tank will supply us with heat , and this doorknob , properly turned , will allow us access to the cabin .
c. montgomery burns|well , i don't suppose the others will mind us starting the party early , homie old boy .
c. montgomery burns|more champagne ?
c. montgomery burns|oh , yes , but i'd trade it all for a little more .
c. montgomery burns|oh , yes , sitting .
c. montgomery burns|the great leveler .
c. montgomery burns|from the mightiest pharaoh to the lowliest peasant , who doesn't enjoy a good sit ?
c. montgomery burns|yes , yes !
c. montgomery burns|that's it !
c. montgomery burns|oh , i could go for one of those right now !
c. montgomery burns|the only hard part is getting up .
c. montgomery burns|why , you'd have to get up .
c. montgomery burns|sir , i am in your debt .
c. montgomery burns|hope that wasn't an avalanche .
c. montgomery burns|be a chum and have a looksee .
c. montgomery burns|isn't there any way out of here ?
c. montgomery burns|there must be some way to contact the outside world .
c. montgomery burns|ah , the telegraph .
c. montgomery burns|sos .
c. montgomery burns|avalanche ^
c. montgomery burns|send ^
c. montgomery burns|help ^
c. montgomery burns|simpson , i have a confession .
c. montgomery burns|i'm not quite the tunnel digger i made myself out to be .
c. montgomery burns|all right , good .
c. montgomery burns|let's dig ^
c. montgomery burns|that's right , dig some more ^
c. montgomery burns|oh , we make quite a duo burns and associate .
c. montgomery burns|no , no , what am i thinking ?
c. montgomery burns|burns and ^
c. montgomery burns|teammate .
c. montgomery burns|what happened ?
c. montgomery burns|we ^
c. montgomery burns|should ^
c. montgomery burns|be ^
c. montgomery burns|careful ^
c. montgomery burns|not ^
c. montgomery burns|to ^
c. montgomery burns|speak ^
c. montgomery burns|unless ^
c. montgomery burns|it's ^
c. montgomery burns|absolutely ^
c. montgomery burns|positively ^
c. montgomery burns|necessary .
c. montgomery burns|let's go .
c. montgomery burns|those last three avalanches were your fault , simpson .
c. montgomery burns|sew buttons .
c. montgomery burns|we must be covered by a thousand feet of snow .
c. montgomery burns|hmmm ^
c. montgomery burns|no books , no radio , no board games .
c. montgomery burns|ah !
c. montgomery burns|a bazooka joe comic .
c. montgomery burns|ech !
c. montgomery burns|i heard that one 75 years ago .
c. montgomery burns|no , i have a better idea !
c. montgomery burns|we could build real men .
c. montgomery burns|out of snow .
c. montgomery burns|ah .
c. montgomery burns|206 bones ^
c. montgomery burns|fifty miles of small intestine ^
c. montgomery burns|full , pouting lips .
c. montgomery burns|why , this fellow is less a snowman than a god .
c. montgomery burns|well , we've managed to stave off cabin fever for a few hours .
c. montgomery burns|i ^
c. montgomery burns|i think we should dress the snowmen .
c. montgomery burns|look at them .
c. montgomery burns|smug and secure in their finery .
c. montgomery burns|mocking us .
c. montgomery burns|ah , snowmen have peepers .
c. montgomery burns|peepers to watch .
c. montgomery burns|to watch for our moment of weakness and then baff !
c. montgomery burns|comes the knock on the head and we're down .
c. montgomery burns|oh , wouldn't you like to know .
c. montgomery burns|i'll kill you , you bloated museum of treachery .
c. montgomery burns|homer !
c. montgomery burns|we'll be dashed to pieces .
c. montgomery burns|have you people forgotten our little competition ?
c. montgomery burns|last one in the cabin is fired .
c. montgomery burns|you're fired , lenny .
c. montgomery burns|so how did we do ?
c. montgomery burns|outstanding .
c. montgomery burns|well , perhaps all of this has been worthwhile .
c. montgomery burns|did you all learn about teamwork ?
c. montgomery burns|excellent .
c. montgomery burns|in that case , no one will be fired after all .
c. montgomery burns|well , simpson , i must say , once you've been through something like that with a person , you never want to see that person again .
c. montgomery burns|bah humbug .
c. montgomery burns|balderdash .
c. montgomery burns|this is the silliest load of ^
c. montgomery burns|ooh , look at it fly .
c. montgomery burns|whee !

c. montgomery burns|god bless you shary bobbins .
c. montgomery burns|why that canine has the proud bearing and glossy fur coat of a yale man .
c. montgomery burns|hello , little fella .
c. montgomery burns|smithers , i believe this dog was in skull and bones .
c. montgomery burns|i'll keep it short and sweet .
c. montgomery burns|family , religion , friendship these are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business .
c. montgomery burns|when opportunity knocks , you don't want to be driving to the maternity hospital or sitting in some phony baloney church .
c. montgomery burns|or synagogue .
c. montgomery burns|questions ?
c. montgomery burns|are there any real questions ?
c. montgomery burns|reecyyycling ?
c. montgomery burns|i'm afraid i'm not familiar with that term , you adorable little ragamuffin .
c. montgomery burns|oh , so mother nature needs a favor ?
c. montgomery burns|well , maybe she should have thought of that when she was besetting us with droughts and floods and poison monkeys .
c. montgomery burns|nature started the fight for survival and now she wants to quit because she's losing ?
c. montgomery burns|well , i say hard cheese !
c. montgomery burns|well surely you agree we can do without her .
c. montgomery burns|no ?
c. montgomery burns|i'll handle it , smithers .
c. montgomery burns|shut up , little girl .

c. montgomery burns|oh , that's your excuse for everything .

c. montgomery burns|this calls for an aggressive trading strategy .

c. montgomery burns|s .
c. montgomery burns|hay ^
