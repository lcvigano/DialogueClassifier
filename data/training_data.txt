bart simpson|jessica , i think this is too steep .
bart simpson|oh , the glue will slow me down .

bart simpson|i ...
bart simpson|i didn't take it .
bart simpson|no .
bart simpson|we've gotta talk .
bart simpson|well , it seems like if you really care for me , you should come forward .
bart simpson|that doesn't make any sense .
bart simpson|jessica , you're really beautiful , but you are not very nice .

marge simpson|when i was young , i always hated knowing my parents were fighting .
marge simpson|homer , do you remember the way you acted at the party last night ?
marge simpson|but last night , you didn't just cross that line , you threw up on it !
marge simpson|i'm going to church alone today .
marge simpson|you're going to stay here and explain to bart why you scarred him for life .

marge simpson|we're going to this retreat to give our marriage a tuneup and that's all .

marge simpson|grampa ?
marge simpson|grampa , could you do something ?
marge simpson|well , i was wondering .
marge simpson|do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend ?
marge simpson|i wouldn't ask , except i'm desperate .
marge simpson|now , if maggie runs a fever , you call this number .
marge simpson|if she sticks her finger in an electrical socket , call this number .
marge simpson|and if she drinks pine cleanser , call this ...
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|goodbye , children .
marge simpson|and behave yourselves .
marge simpson|call this number if grampa falls in the bathtub .
marge simpson|hello , reverend .
marge simpson|we're glad we could come .
marge simpson|oh , hello helen .
marge simpson|oh , homer .
marge simpson|well , it's not that i don't love the guy .
marge simpson|i'm always sticking up for him .
marge simpson|it's just that he's so selfcentered .
marge simpson|he blows his nose on the towels , and puts them back in the middle ...
marge simpson|he drinks out of the carton .
marge simpson|he never changes the baby .
marge simpson|oh ...
marge simpson|oh ...
marge simpson|and he scratches himself with his keys .
marge simpson|i guess that's it .
marge simpson|oh no .
marge simpson|wait .
marge simpson|he kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow .
marge simpson|that's all i can think of right now .
marge simpson|homer , you're sneaking out to go fishing ?
marge simpson|i can't believe your selfishness .
marge simpson|you can go fishing anytime , but we're here trying to save our marriage .
marge simpson|you're thinking about fishing , even when i'm talking ...
marge simpson|right now .
marge simpson|right ?
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|get back in bed .
marge simpson|sure .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|do i have to do this ?
marge simpson|homer , how can you expect me to believe ...
marge simpson|to who ?
marge simpson|all this fish represents is just how selfish you are .
marge simpson|oh yeah , sure .
marge simpson|ohhh , homer .
marge simpson|oh my , the house looks wonderful .
marge simpson|grampa , what's your secret ?
marge simpson|kids , could you lighten up a little ?
marge simpson|we're here !
marge simpson|so , did you kids have fun ?
marge simpson|ohhh .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|don't gloat , homer .
marge simpson|for months , i worked and worked , while my sisters smoked and smoked ...
marge simpson|but the big day finally came .
marge simpson|and because i'd worked for it , all those lightbulbwarmed treats always tasted extragood .
marge simpson|so maybe a parttime job is the answer .
marge simpson|the poor boy is so desperate .
marge simpson|he wants to earn money to buy a comic book .
marge simpson|i don't think so .
marge simpson|did you make any money ?
marge simpson|well , i think what you're doing for mrs glick is very nice .
marge simpson|the poor old thing doesn't have anybody .
marge simpson|i thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s'mores .
marge simpson|homer , it's really coming down .
marge simpson|could you check on the boys ?
marge simpson|boys , you better come in the house .
marge simpson|you don't want to get the sniffles .
marge simpson|now come on ...
marge simpson|you can play your little tieup game inside .
marge simpson|i've got some cocoa on the stove .
marge simpson|who wants imitation marshmallows ?
marge simpson|what are you doing , honey ?
marge simpson|lisa , we did the best we could ...
marge simpson|what's a zebu ?
marge simpson|apositive .
marge simpson|a mother knows everything about her family .
marge simpson|four b .
marge simpson|sixteen permanent , eight baby .
marge simpson|xl .
marge simpson|i don't want you wearing rings , it looks cheap , but three .
marge simpson|butterscotch and imitation butterscotch .
marge simpson|glow in the dark monster makeup .
marge simpson|oh , homie , you have lots of hair ...
marge simpson|why did you want to know your blood type ?
marge simpson|bart does .
marge simpson|bart , you have to help someone in need .
marge simpson|it's the only decent thing to do .
marge simpson|the meaning of what ?
marge simpson|homer , you don't do things like that to be rewarded .
marge simpson|you do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand .
marge simpson|but he's your boss .
marge simpson|do you have to mail it right this minute ?
marge simpson|you're still angry , homer .
marge simpson|why don't you sleep on it ?
marge simpson|please , homie ?
marge simpson|for me ?
marge simpson|homer ...
marge simpson|breakfast is ready .
marge simpson|oh ...
marge simpson|thank you .
marge simpson|homer , i don't think it's in the cornstarch canister .
marge simpson|homer , you encouraged him .
marge simpson|you should be strangling yourself .
marge simpson|honey , what's done is done .
marge simpson|no matter what happens , we'll pull through .
marge simpson|we always do .
marge simpson|oh , my !
marge simpson|it's mr burns .
marge simpson|it doesn't do anything .
marge simpson|whatever it does , it's doing it now .
marge simpson|homer , it's the thought that counts .
marge simpson|the moral of this story is , a good deed is its own reward .
marge simpson|well then , i guess the moral is , no good deed goes unrewarded .
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|then i guess the moral is , the squeaky wheel gets the grease .
marge simpson|but it certainly was a memorable few days !
marge simpson|bart , watch maggie while i get the laundry .
marge simpson|maggie !
marge simpson|bart , i asked you to watch your sister !
marge simpson|i washed it .
marge simpson|now homer , don't panic .
marge simpson|you have plenty of white shirts .
marge simpson|i don't know how this could have happened .
marge simpson|homer , please .
marge simpson|no one's going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work .
marge simpson|homer , this is an intimate psychological profile .
marge simpson|i can't fill this out for you .
marge simpson|oh my god !
marge simpson|mother was right .
marge simpson|i told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house .
marge simpson|i said crazy house !
marge simpson|crazy house !
marge simpson|crazy house !
marge simpson|oh , homie .
marge simpson|well , at least we got a free sample of reading digest .
marge simpson|no , it is not the truth , homer .
marge simpson|it's well documented that women are safer drivers than men .
marge simpson|you've certainly taken a shine to that magazine .
marge simpson|homer , he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article .
marge simpson|homie ...
marge simpson|put down your magazine for a minute ...
marge simpson|i thought you might want to snuggle .
marge simpson|thank you , homie .
marge simpson|it certainly has enriched our lives .
marge simpson|bart , maybe this is something you'd like to do , too .
marge simpson|how's it going , honey ?
marge simpson|do kids go on bike rides anymore ?
marge simpson|i don't know , i thought maybe bikes weren't cool anymore .
marge simpson|do kids still use that word , cool ?
marge simpson|oooh , look , homer .
marge simpson|the irs .
marge simpson|here we are , kids !
marge simpson|the watergate .
marge simpson|homer , look !
marge simpson|they give you a shower cap , and body gel and bathrobes ...
marge simpson|ooh , and a welcoming mint on your pillow .

marge simpson|i know , honey , but just sit still .
marge simpson|lisa , what's gotten into you ?
marge simpson|imprisoned congressman becomes bornagain christian .
marge simpson|no , that was about the budget gap .
marge simpson|this is the trading gap .
marge simpson|i think it means he's having a barbecue .
marge simpson|he's trying to be friendly .
marge simpson|oh , homer .
marge simpson|hi , ned .
marge simpson|homer sends his apologies , but uh ...
marge simpson|there was some important work at the plant that only he could take care of .
marge simpson|bart , how many hours a day do you watch tv ?
marge simpson|don't you think you should get a little fresh air and maybe some exercise ?
marge simpson|that's the problem .
marge simpson|those children's parents should be ashamed of themselves .
marge simpson|that sounds fine , bart .
marge simpson|so bart , what did you learn in karate school today ?
marge simpson|bart , don't use the touch of death on your sister .
marge simpson|homer , this is the flanders' entire living room set .
marge simpson|how much did you pay for this ?
marge simpson|seventyfive dollars ?
marge simpson|ned must be desperate !
marge simpson|you got a job ?
marge simpson|doing what ?
marge simpson|bart , your father and i don't want you doing that .
marge simpson|homer , say something .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|i thinks they're criminals .
marge simpson|well , bart's been acting very strangely .
marge simpson|and that pizza delivery truck has been parked across the street for two weeks .
marge simpson|how long does it take to deliver a pizza ?
marge simpson|homer , i want you to go down to that club and talk to them .
marge simpson|just see what kind of people they are .
marge simpson|please , homie ?
marge simpson|homer , what did you find out ?
marge simpson|oh , bart .
marge simpson|why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys .
marge simpson|principal skinner !
marge simpson|well , they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us .
marge simpson|oh my lord !
marge simpson|homie , please be all right .
marge simpson|i don't know what i can do ...
marge simpson|homer , did you go out and buy a twenty pound ham ?
marge simpson|and what's all this ?
marge simpson|for heroic competence ...
marge simpson|employeeofthemonth !
marge simpson|ohh , homer !
marge simpson|how are you enjoying your ham , homie ?
marge simpson|bart , don't feed your sister hotels !
marge simpson|i think that game is too old for her .
marge simpson|why don't you go play with milhouse ?
marge simpson|you mean you still haven't made up with him ?
marge simpson|he's got a spark .
marge simpson|it's not a bad thing ...
marge simpson|of course it makes him do bad things ...
marge simpson|well , i can't defend everything he does .
marge simpson|but let's face it , all bart and milhouse have is each other .
marge simpson|they're too young for girls .
marge simpson|and they're a popular target for bullies .
marge simpson|and in the christmas pageant , they're always sheep .
marge simpson|please , please , let them be friends !
marge simpson|well , i knew his mother would come to her senses .
marge simpson|what makes you think i did it ?
marge simpson|you be good .
marge simpson|hello ?
marge simpson|oh hello , mrs pennycandy .
marge simpson|oh , dear .

marge simpson|goodbye .
marge simpson|sweetie , i'm sorry , but krusty isn't coming to dinner again .
marge simpson|bart , wipe your feet .
marge simpson|i've got some good news .
marge simpson|krusty the clown is coming to dinner tonight .
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|who wants to say grace ?
marge simpson|krusty , why don't you tell us what's wrong ?
marge simpson|you'll feel better .
marge simpson|well , look at the time .
marge simpson|almost midnight .
marge simpson|homer , maybe you better take milhouse home .
marge simpson|we're home !
marge simpson|now children , you can have one piece of candy tonight and save the rest for ...
marge simpson|if you eat too much you'll have nightmares .

marge simpson|my purse exploded !
marge simpson|ugghh , homer .
marge simpson|where did you get that ugly thing ?
marge simpson|homer , there's something i don't like about that severed hand .
marge simpson|oh , my land !
marge simpson|ooh , a new pacifier .
marge simpson|homer , maybe fame and fortune aren't as bad as they say .
marge simpson|oh homer , this is awful .
marge simpson|good morning , dear .
marge simpson|much better !
marge simpson|oh good , the curtains are on fire !
marge simpson|now hadn't you better get ready for school ?
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|that's it , young man .
marge simpson|you're coming with me ...
marge simpson|please ?
marge simpson|my goodness , what's wrong ?
marge simpson|it's your father , he's missing .
marge simpson|he's been gone for two days .
marge simpson|did you have a nightmare , homie ?
marge simpson|don't worry , honey , i'm sure your father is ...
marge simpson|maybe .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|that's a long shot .
marge simpson|bingo .
marge simpson|don't worry , he'll be here .
marge simpson|look homer , lisa's taking her first steps .
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|did you hear that , homer ?
marge simpson|homer , if you want to make up with lisa just spend some time with her .
marge simpson|homie , you've got to stop looking for the quick fix .
marge simpson|if you keep spending time with lisa , she'll forgive you .
marge simpson|we can't afford to buy a pony .
marge simpson|that's ridiculous .
marge simpson|that's no reason to buy a pony !
marge simpson|stick to the subject .
marge simpson|let's be realistic .
marge simpson|a pony is very expensive and we have enough trouble paying bills as it is .
marge simpson|you sound like you're going to buy a pony .
marge simpson|promise me you won't .
marge simpson|what was that ?
marge simpson|was that a yes or a no ?
marge simpson|those aren't even words !
marge simpson|i am very upset with you .
marge simpson|homer , just where were you planning to keep this horse ?
marge simpson|that's illegal .
marge simpson|hmm , oh dear , we're in serious trouble here .
marge simpson|we're just going to have to cut down on luxuries .
marge simpson|actually , i was thinking we could cut down on your beer .
marge simpson|then i'm afraid there's no choice but to give up the pony back .
marge simpson|homer ...
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|you got us into this , you get us out .
marge simpson|homer , where have you been ?
marge simpson|i was so worried .
marge simpson|homie , how long do you plan to do this ?
marge simpson|thirty years ?
marge simpson|he's just exhausted .
marge simpson|lisa , do you know how much it costs to keep a pony ?
marge simpson|well , it's a lot .
marge simpson|in fact , your father had to take a second job .
marge simpson|the kwikemart .
marge simpson|lisa , i hope you realize that your father can't keep this up .
marge simpson|lisa , we can't make you give up that pony .
marge simpson|no , bart .
marge simpson|no one's going to make her .
marge simpson|this is something lisa has to decide for herself .
marge simpson|homer , can you get the door ?
marge simpson|it's my sisters .
marge simpson|homer , be nice .
marge simpson|what's the matter , can't you find a hair style you like ?
marge simpson|ed asner ?
marge simpson|homer , are you ordering junk off the tv again ?
marge simpson|who's using the power tools ?
marge simpson|well , we're going to the beauty parlor .
marge simpson|maybe you should do something with the kids while i'm gone .
marge simpson|i don't know .
marge simpson|homie , we're back .
marge simpson|homer , could you turn off the tv ?
marge simpson|there's a little test i want you to take .
marge simpson|this is from the national fatherhood institute .
marge simpson|it evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father .
marge simpson|question one name one of your child's friends ...
marge simpson|they want a name , homer , not a vague description .
marge simpson|hank ?
marge simpson|hank who ?
marge simpson|homer , you made that up .
marge simpson|question two who is your son's hero ?
marge simpson|that's your hero .
marge simpson|name another dad you talked to about parenting .
marge simpson|what are your son's hobbies ?
marge simpson|he hasn't done that since he was two .
marge simpson|oh really ?
marge simpson|well , maybe you should go out in the garage and see .
marge simpson|now , don't pout .
marge simpson|don't you at least have something to say to bart ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|i've always said you were a good father .
marge simpson|i've always defended you when people put you down .
marge simpson|but i guess i was wrong .
marge simpson|you are a bad father .
marge simpson|bart , you know there is such a thing as being a bad winner .
marge simpson|honey , what's wrong ?
marge simpson|homie , why don't you just go down to moe's and talk to him ?
marge simpson|i bet he'd be willing to share some of his success with you .
marge simpson|so , mr hutz , does my husband have a case ?
marge simpson|well , duh .
marge simpson|bart , are you going to moe the lawn today ?
marge simpson|i moe , i moe .
marge simpson|of course .
marge simpson|all work and moe play makes moe a moe moe .
marge simpson|bart !

marge simpson|we've never had one .
marge simpson|kids , i think everything is going to be okay from now on .
marge simpson|oh , homer !
marge simpson|we heard !
marge simpson|isn't it wonderful ?
marge simpson|we have some great plans for that money .
marge simpson|what do you mean ?
marge simpson|you spent fiftytwo hundred dollars on beer ?
marge simpson|look at all those worried faces except for lenny .
marge simpson|he looks great .
marge simpson|homie , come to bed .
marge simpson|don't worry .
marge simpson|whatever happens , we'll pay the bills somehow .
marge simpson|well , if you can't sleep , why don't you do something constructive ?
marge simpson|we all have to pull together 'til your father gets a new job .
marge simpson|that's very clever .
marge simpson|hmmm , you shouldn't do that .
marge simpson|that's good , lisa .
marge simpson|i want you to take baths , bart .
marge simpson|bart , i want you to go down to moe's tavern .
marge simpson|i need you to bring your father home .

marge simpson|i think about you , too .
marge simpson|oh , homer .
marge simpson|you light up my days / and fill my nights / with song ...
marge simpson|our song .
marge simpson|actually , she was singing about god .
marge simpson|you don't have to do that .

marge simpson|well , i could use a little more .
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|name me one person who's gotten rich by doing yoyo tricks .
marge simpson|maybe we should let the dog in ?
marge simpson|i think he needs a dog house .
marge simpson|i'll bet we could buy a nice doghouse for fifty dollars .
marge simpson|i am not !
marge simpson|oh , i don't know ...
marge simpson|how was detention today , dear ?
marge simpson|of course i saved them .
marge simpson|although actually there's only one .
marge simpson|and it's more of a love postcard , from some brewery he visited .
marge simpson|well , you know , maybe he's right .
marge simpson|actually , homer , you brought up ned flanders .
marge simpson|no , you're not .
marge simpson|when my father got out of the navy , he used to curse a blue streak .
marge simpson|it almost cost him his job as a baby photographer .
marge simpson|so , my mom put a swear jar in the kitchen .
marge simpson|every time he said a bad word , he put in a quarter .
marge simpson|what do you think ?
marge simpson|yes , homer .
marge simpson|no , homer .
marge simpson|yes , homer .
marge simpson|uh ...
marge simpson|that's okay .
marge simpson|there was more than enough in the swear jar .
marge simpson|and if you look inside the doghouse , there's a little surprise .
marge simpson|no , behind her .
marge simpson|where's maggie ?
marge simpson|where's maggie ?
marge simpson|there's maggie !
marge simpson|oh , my special little guy has a sweetheart .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|bart , you did a very cruel thing .
marge simpson|no , homer .
marge simpson|the truth would humiliate her .
marge simpson|we'll all help .
marge simpson|that's disgusting .
marge simpson|homer , for the last time , i am not putting that in .
marge simpson|oh , that's very good , lisa .
marge simpson|how shall we end it ?
marge simpson|oh , that's sweet .
marge simpson|homie , come to bed .
marge simpson|homer , go back to the garage .
marge simpson|and the next man wants to hit the ball too .
marge simpson|and he does .
marge simpson|and there he goes off in that direction .
marge simpson|and everyone is happy .
marge simpson|that's all right dear .
marge simpson|i can do it .
marge simpson|you hit so many home runs this year .
marge simpson|what makes you think this darryl strawberry character is better than you ?
marge simpson|oh , homie .
marge simpson|you're good at lots of things .
marge simpson|like snuggling ...
marge simpson|children , that's not very nice .
marge simpson|oh , dear .
marge simpson|children , tell me when your father stops scratching himself .
marge simpson|kids ?
marge simpson|oh , dear .
marge simpson|ohh , well , i guess he'll be happy when he comes to .
marge simpson|lisa , it's not that bad .
marge simpson|that's nice , bart .
marge simpson|you know your father wanted to be a policeman for a little while .
marge simpson|but they said he was too heavy .
marge simpson|honey , if that's what you want , we'll do anything we can to help .
marge simpson|so you think she has talent ?
marge simpson|do you think she could be a professional some day ?
marge simpson|morning , honey .
marge simpson|oh well , you'd be surprised .
marge simpson|bad dog !
marge simpson|very bad dog .
marge simpson|oh ...
marge simpson|oh ...
marge simpson|unng ...
marge simpson|oh , bart .
marge simpson|lisa , why aren't you at band practice ?
marge simpson|oh , honey , right now you're discouraged .
marge simpson|but deep down , you know you love the saxophone .
marge simpson|i think you should stay in the band .
marge simpson|but they don't always know what they're talking about .
marge simpson|so you see , my sisters were wrong .
marge simpson|except about the cities on the moon .
marge simpson|i was wrong about that .
marge simpson|so ...
marge simpson|well , you can see how anyone can be wrong .
marge simpson|bart's grades are up a little this term .
marge simpson|but lisa's are way down .
marge simpson|we have three kids , homer .
marge simpson|no , maggie !
marge simpson|but we never ever ...
marge simpson|i buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon .
marge simpson|we each play our birthday .
marge simpson|and that's enough excitement for me .
marge simpson|homer , we're on a tight budget here .
marge simpson|promise me you won't get carried away .
marge simpson|you can still win some money if you have five out of six .
marge simpson|homer , the odds are three hundred and eighty million to one .
marge simpson|oh well ...
marge simpson|we lost the money , but at least we've still got each other .
marge simpson|well , he's not dead , but he is awfully sick .
marge simpson|hmm , how much will it cost ?
marge simpson|oh dear !
marge simpson|oh , honey .
marge simpson|sevenhundred and fifty dollars is a lot of money .
marge simpson|we really can't afford this operation .
marge simpson|bart , watch your language .
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|you did .
marge simpson|sorry .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|you are not going to perform that operation yourself .
marge simpson|i've found a way we can pay for the operation .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i'm afraid we're just going to have to make a few sacrifices .
marge simpson|homer , you're going to have to give up beer for a while .
marge simpson|fried chicken night will now be organ meat night .
marge simpson|ham night will be spam night .
marge simpson|and porkchop night ...
marge simpson|will now be chub night .
marge simpson|we all have to make sacrifices , dear .
marge simpson|maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer ...
marge simpson|i don't think you've thought this through .
marge simpson|you wouldn't want what he's eating .
marge simpson|it's mostly just snouts and entrails .
marge simpson|what's that ?
marge simpson|oh no !
marge simpson|those are my numbers !
marge simpson|if it wasn't for that dog , i would've won !
marge simpson|not now .
marge simpson|homie , did you close the gate ?
marge simpson|the dog will get out !
marge simpson|here boy !
marge simpson|not one that i want the public to see .
marge simpson|homer get ahold of yourself .
marge simpson|even if he has passed on , there's no reason to cry .
marge simpson|remember doggie heaven .
marge simpson|you can pet the cat .
marge simpson|oh , there's a spot , dear .
marge simpson|that spot says compact only .
marge simpson|so , what are we going to see ?
marge simpson|hmm ?
marge simpson|maybe we could see something a little more adult .
marge simpson|ooh !
marge simpson|the paper called it a taut political thriller .
marge simpson|well of course he's a spy .
marge simpson|you just saw him go through spy school !
marge simpson|oh , shut up , homer !
marge simpson|no one wants to hear what you think !
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homie , aren't you coming inside ?
marge simpson|where were you all night ?
marge simpson|you should have called .
marge simpson|i was very worried .
marge simpson|well , it's nice .
marge simpson|but who is this woman ?
marge simpson|i don't like you hanging around with some cocktail waitress !
marge simpson|i don't want to .
marge simpson|i'm mad at you .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|where did you get that suit ?
marge simpson|was it lurleen ?
marge simpson|don't lie to me .
marge simpson|are you having an affair with this woman ?
marge simpson|have you kissed her ?
marge simpson|has she kissed you ?
marge simpson|i want you to stop seeing her .
marge simpson|her manager ?

marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|bart , what's going on ?

marge simpson|otto , i think you should get a job .
marge simpson|so get that piece of paper !
marge simpson|i know how you feel , but he is good with the kids .
marge simpson|but homer , we're the only family he's got ...

marge simpson|reverend lovejoy , i had a bit of an ulterior motive in inviting you to dinner .

marge simpson|there once was an ugly duckling ...
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|i meant you were one of the goodlooking ducks ...
marge simpson|that makes fun of the ugly one .
marge simpson|homer , lisa's already sensitive about her looks .
marge simpson|this is the last thing she needs .
marge simpson|you're looking at her through a father's eyes .
marge simpson|honey , no one's going to force you to do anything ...
marge simpson|but do you know how your father got the money to enter you in this pageant ?
marge simpson|he sold his ride on the duff blimp .

marge simpson|you don't have a cousin frank .
marge simpson|that afternoon , we left bart with my sisters and went househunting .

marge simpson|bart , get out !
marge simpson|bart , from now on , the baby sleeps in the crib .
marge simpson|homie ...
marge simpson|i think the baby's coming .
marge simpson|according to this magazine , bart might be jealous of her .
marge simpson|well , bart , what do you think of little lisa ?
marge simpson|i saved this newspaper from the day lisa was born .
marge simpson|everyone agreed that lisa was a beautiful baby ...

marge simpson|well surely you've all noticed the terrible condition main street is in .
marge simpson|and those potholes are becoming a real nuisance .
marge simpson|but main street's still all cracked and broken .
marge simpson|i still think we should have spent the money to fix main street .
marge simpson|homer , no ...
marge simpson|according to this book , the monorail goes over a hundred and fifty miles an hour .
marge simpson|what if something goes wrong ?
marge simpson|it frightens me that you want to work on something that's so unsafe .

marge simpson|homer , that isn't very nice .
marge simpson|homer , we have a perfectly good bookcase .

marge simpson|you changed your grade with a computer ?
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|what's wrong ?
marge simpson|what are you doin' ?
marge simpson|i don't think it's a good idea to humiliate your boss on his birthday .
marge simpson|come on dear .
marge simpson|it's time to go .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|you've got to stop insulting everyone , especially your boss .
marge simpson|hmm , better sew that eye back on .
marge simpson|i'm sure he'll offer us a fair reward .
marge simpson|and then we'll make him double it .
marge simpson|well why can't i be greedy once in awhile ?
marge simpson|more cocoa , mr burns ?
marge simpson|have you been up all night eating cheese ?
marge simpson|i think we need a new hairdryer .

marge simpson|that's a photo of homer and me at our wedding .
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|homer ate the entire wedding cake by himself ...
marge simpson|before the wedding .
marge simpson|read the back , the back .
marge simpson|homer , stop picking at it .
marge simpson|lisa , your brother's obviously had a nightmare .
marge simpson|don't worry , honey , the scary part's over .
marge simpson|lisa , stop being so suspicious .
marge simpson|did everyone wash their necks like mr burns asked ?
marge simpson|how'd you know he's a vampire ?
marge simpson|homer , we gotta do something !
marge simpson|today he's drinking people's blood , tomorrow he could be smoking !
marge simpson|this is dangerous .
marge simpson|i wish we could have found a sitter for maggie .
marge simpson|no , i'm the head vampire !
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|well , i do have a life outside this house , you know .
marge simpson|marge simpson .
marge simpson|i'd like to pledge thirty dollars .

marge simpson|why ?
marge simpson|your point being ?
marge simpson|well , you were unlucky , but there are a lot of good men out there .
marge simpson|mrs simpson , while we were rescuing your husband , a lumberyard burned down .
marge simpson|in fact , we're going out again tomorrow night .
marge simpson|homer , please .
marge simpson|you know it's hard for me to make friends .
marge simpson|what's so special about it ?
marge simpson|i don't know .
marge simpson|i'm not sure .
marge simpson|you already asked me that .
marge simpson|don't wait up .
marge simpson|you look ...
marge simpson|nice .
marge simpson|i am lucky .
marge simpson|i have a husband and three wonderful children , thank you very much .
marge simpson|oh ...
marge simpson|i've heard a lot about shot kickers .
marge simpson|i said , no .
marge simpson|ooh , i've never been to an underground club .
marge simpson|mayor quimby !
marge simpson|what are you doing here ?
marge simpson|oh , that's nice .
marge simpson|what was it you wanted to show me ?
marge simpson|you're not going to hunt me for sport , are you ?
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i couldn't .
marge simpson|i hit it !
marge simpson|i hit it !
marge simpson|phht , it's only midnight .
marge simpson|come on , i know a place .
marge simpson|beautiful , huh ?
marge simpson|homer and i used to come up here on dates .
marge simpson|homer , stop that !
marge simpson|it's just a weather station .
marge simpson|me too .
marge simpson|there's an awful lot of black smoke coming from my chimney .
marge simpson|maybe we should call it a night .
marge simpson|i think they want us to stop .
marge simpson|stolen ?
marge simpson|ruth , is there something you want to tell me ?
marge simpson|mmm hmm .
marge simpson|didn't you realize all you had to do was report him to the police ?
marge simpson|i don't want to be a wet blanket , but maybe you should give yourself up .
marge simpson|oh , i don't think they're gonna be that easy to lose .
marge simpson|i mean these are professional lawmen and ...
marge simpson|well , bye .
marge simpson|yeah .
marge simpson|everything before the highspeed chase was just lovely .
marge simpson|ruth , i've done a lot of thinking , and i really consider you a friend .
marge simpson|and an important part of friendship is ...
marge simpson|my god !
marge simpson|that must be every policeman in springfield !
marge simpson|ruth , that's a lot of hooey .
marge simpson|it's not over until it's over .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , i should have asked first .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|you're right .
marge simpson|i am lucky to have him .
marge simpson|chasm ?
marge simpson|stop that , bart .
marge simpson|homer , speak to him .
marge simpson|why do you read that free column , homer ?
marge simpson|they never have anything good .
marge simpson|please don't bring home anymore old crutches !
marge simpson|i don't know if this is a good idea .
marge simpson|are you sure it's safe ?
marge simpson|homer , this is terrible !
marge simpson|i told you this was a bad idea !
marge simpson|that's not true .
marge simpson|i can name ten things !
marge simpson|i ...
marge simpson|i made sloppy joes ...
marge simpson|kids .
marge simpson|tell me the truth .
marge simpson|am i no fun ?
marge simpson|do i just nag all the time ?
marge simpson|i didn't realize people saw me that way .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i'm fine .
marge simpson|i'm going to my sisters' now .
marge simpson|i'm watching a videotape that could change our lives .
marge simpson|shhh !
marge simpson|that video really opened my eyes .
marge simpson|i can see that i'm just a passiveaggressive coculprit .
marge simpson|by nagging you when you do foolish things , i just enable your lifescript .
marge simpson|exactly !
marge simpson|so from now on , i'm going to quit nagging and have more fun .
marge simpson|homer , did you eat my whole pan of brownies ?
marge simpson|i'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame .
marge simpson|i'm feeling annoyance and frustration , but also tolerance .
marge simpson|good .
marge simpson|i'm glad we had this talk .
marge simpson|brad goodman is coming to town !
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|be quiet !
marge simpson|oh , thank you .
marge simpson|his name is bart .
marge simpson|i knew it .
marge simpson|if only i had nagged more ...
marge simpson|that's not fair .
marge simpson|the lesson here is that selfimprovement is better left to people who live in big cities .
marge simpson|homer , i have to go out to pick up something for dinner .
marge simpson|money's too tight for steak .
marge simpson|sure , steak .
marge simpson|i know you think the junior campers are square and ...
marge simpson|homer , you should be more supportive .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|still no help .
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|hi , hober .
marge simpson|dote kiss be , i'b all stuffed up .
marge simpson|oh that's sweet .
marge simpson|guess what .
marge simpson|there's a new place at the mall they'll put your picture on a tshirt .
marge simpson|i got two dollars off because mine got smeared .
marge simpson|good news , honey .
marge simpson|two weeks are up .
marge simpson|you don't have to wear your glasses anymore .
marge simpson|and your scalp and posture seem fine .
marge simpson|this was a wonderful idea , homie .
marge simpson|hey , there's a turkey behind the bed .
marge simpson|actually , i think it might really help our economy .
marge simpson|this could be a whole new beginning for springfield .
marge simpson|in honor of legalized gambling , why not go as the state of nevada ?
marge simpson|then how 'about going as florida ?
marge simpson|you enjoy orange juice , and old people like you .
marge simpson|why ?
marge simpson|your lifelong dream was to be a contestant on the gong show .
marge simpson|and you did it in 1977 , remember ?
marge simpson|hi , homie .
marge simpson|i was for the casino !
marge simpson|legalized gambling is a bad idea .
marge simpson|you can build a casino over my dead body !
marge simpson|blah , blah , blah , blah , blah .
marge simpson|blah , blah , blah .
marge simpson|blah , blah , blah , blah , blah ...
marge simpson|i wonder if they have a lost and found .
marge simpson|oh , what the hey .
marge simpson|oh my god , barney , thank you .
marge simpson|i would never have forgiven myself .
marge simpson|now you stay put , young lady .
marge simpson|i'll catch up to you .
marge simpson|i'll walk .
marge simpson|yeah .
marge simpson|go home .
marge simpson|you're bad luck !
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i won sixty dollars last night .
marge simpson|what happened here ?
marge simpson|oh , i'm sorry .
marge simpson|i have been spending too much time at the casino .
marge simpson|i'll be around more from now on .
marge simpson|sure , honey .
marge simpson|i promise .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|what is it ?
marge simpson|slow down .
marge simpson|think before you say each word .
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|lisa's costume .
marge simpson|homer , i didn't realize .
marge simpson|i'm so sorry .
marge simpson|you know , you're right , homer .
marge simpson|maybe i should get some professional help .
marge simpson|that's true .
marge simpson|will you forgive me ?
marge simpson|homer , when you forgive someone , you can't throw it back at them like that .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|and my necklace .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|that necklace was a priceless bouvier family heirloom .
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|yes , i do .
marge simpson|but they're all heirlooms , too .
marge simpson|you have just been robbed by the springfield cat burglar ...
marge simpson|cute .
marge simpson|oh , stop blaming the beans .
marge simpson|and don't take candy from strangers .
marge simpson|i don't think the guns are a good idea , homer .
marge simpson|homer , wasn't the whole point to catch the cat burglar ?
marge simpson|oh my !
marge simpson|i had no idea how much this town loved that zirconia .
marge simpson|bart , i've asked you not to whistle that annoying tune .
marge simpson|just a minute !
marge simpson|don't hang up !
marge simpson|what is it ?
marge simpson|oh , it sounds like you really learned something on your field trip .
marge simpson|think you'd be interested in a career as a box maker ?
marge simpson|i don't know , bart .
marge simpson|you're only ten .
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|bart , it's time to get ready for the show .
marge simpson|you're making people happy .
marge simpson|and that's a very hard thing to do .
marge simpson|the best performance of your life ?
marge simpson|i saved these for you , bart .
marge simpson|yes , he's raking leaves .
marge simpson|it certainly is exotic .
marge simpson|lisa , is that too spicy for you ?
marge simpson|apu , we usually store our cans in the cupboard .
marge simpson|hmm .
marge simpson|oh , we're low on milk for maggie .
marge simpson|you wanna come with me to the kwikemart ?
marge simpson|well , i guess we could go to that new monstromart ...
marge simpson|ooh .
marge simpson|that's a good price for twelve pounds of nutmeg .
marge simpson|but that's the longest .
marge simpson|apu , you've been so helpful .
marge simpson|if it weren't for him , we'd still be in line at the monstromart .
marge simpson|their floors are stickymart .
marge simpson|i guess we've learned that happiness is wherever you find it .
marge simpson|how did it go ?
marge simpson|oh , that'll work out great .
marge simpson|we're out of lucky charms .
marge simpson|that sounds like a good movie .
marge simpson|that toy isn't safe for a baby like maggie .
marge simpson|i understand , honey .
marge simpson|when i was your age there was a ...
marge simpson|hm .
marge simpson|i don't know if it's a good idea to do that while you're driving .
marge simpson|i had a malibu stacy when i was little , and i turned out all right .
marge simpson|now let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream .
marge simpson|honey , you're not going to throw red paint at the executives , are you ?
marge simpson|the keebler people were very upset ...
marge simpson|i'm sorry , homie .
marge simpson|well , we respect you .
marge simpson|bart , i told you , don't draw on your father's skull .
marge simpson|pride ?
marge simpson|but now i realize that being a spaceman is something you have to do .
marge simpson|homer , when i met you , you weren't an astronaut .
marge simpson|you didn't even know how to use a touchtone .
marge simpson|but i still respected you , and i always will , no matter what .
marge simpson|homer , you already dialed .
marge simpson|oh , i am so proud of you .
marge simpson|and i know it's going to go just fine ...
marge simpson|don't worry , kids , i'm sure your father's all right .
marge simpson|who wants ginger snaps ?
marge simpson|homie , you should be proud .
marge simpson|only a handful of people have done what you've done .
marge simpson|bart , do you have something nice to say to your father ?
marge simpson|those aren't tickets to the game , homer .
marge simpson|oooh , the walls are melting again .
marge simpson|homer , that's not god , that's just a waffle that bart tossed up there .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|are you planning to hit ned flanders with that pipe and take his tickets ?
marge simpson|homer , that's our wedding photo .
marge simpson|your family needs you too .
marge simpson|that was you !
marge simpson|there .
marge simpson|i hope the children enjoy my special fruit punch .
marge simpson|but , why would the advisory board give us bad advice ?
marge simpson|that was a very nice thing you did , homey .
marge simpson|sandwich .
marge simpson|underpants .
marge simpson|bowling ball ...
marge simpson|more underpants ...
marge simpson|no one's going anywhere .
marge simpson|we're going to clean the whole house from top to bottom .
marge simpson|i think you'll find that escape is impossible .
marge simpson|now each one of you take a floor and get started .
marge simpson|fine .
marge simpson|oh bart .
marge simpson|cleaning doesn't have to be a chore .
marge simpson|here ...
marge simpson|work to the music .
marge simpson|you're not done .
marge simpson|i want you to throw away these old calendars and tv guides .
marge simpson|stop remembering tv and get back to work .
marge simpson|homer , what's going on down there ?
marge simpson|then stop screaming so loud .
marge simpson|there !
marge simpson|isn't that a lot better ?
marge simpson|now you can do whatever you want .
marge simpson|but don't mess up the house .
marge simpson|or doubleply windows !
marge simpson|they look just like regular windows but they'll save us four percent on our heating bill ...
marge simpson|well , they will .
marge simpson|homer , it looks like it could gore .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|i really think this is a bad idea .
marge simpson|ew , homer , there is a bird on your head ?
marge simpson|stampy's food bill today was three hundred dollars .
marge simpson|oh my lord !
marge simpson|a female deer .
marge simpson|get a rope , bart !
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|this is just what happened at the caramel factory .
marge simpson|gosh , i thought he'd be happier in his true habitat .
marge simpson|then why is he attacking all those other elephants ?
marge simpson|this could provide for your entire future .
marge simpson|uh , sure .
marge simpson|i've gotta stop fantasizing about lee majors .
marge simpson|ah , one more .
marge simpson|no it's not .
marge simpson|i think bart and lisa are feeling a little upset right now .
marge simpson|isn't there something you'd like to say ?
marge simpson|are you thinking what i'm thinking ?
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|c'mon , honey .
marge simpson|bart , don't throw peas at your sister .
marge simpson|homer , say something .
marge simpson|i'm very concerned .
marge simpson|mr burns has stolen our son and he won't give him back .
marge simpson|you know we should really stop hiring him .
marge simpson|are you sure you can get him back for us ?
marge simpson|what about peter fonda ?
marge simpson|homer , that's hans moleman .
marge simpson|lisa , what are you doing ?
marge simpson|that's sweet , honey .
marge simpson|homer , i want that thing out of my house .
marge simpson|why don't you bring this potato ?
marge simpson|it's pretty big .
marge simpson|i just think they're neat .
marge simpson|the dog has had enough excitement .
marge simpson|ned , homer and i are a little concerned with the way the school's being run .
marge simpson|what's going on in there ?
marge simpson|it says freddy quimby beat a waiter half to death .
marge simpson|those quimby children are so wild and rich .
marge simpson|i hope he finally gets what's coming to him .
marge simpson|unfortunately , one day he put his theory into practice .
marge simpson|it took seventyfive federal marshals to bring him down .
marge simpson|now , let's never speak of him again .
marge simpson|hmm ?
marge simpson|good for you , homie .

marge simpson|he's an evil man !
marge simpson|what about abe simpson ?
marge simpson|don't you have any feelings for him ?
marge simpson|hm ?
marge simpson|hm ?
marge simpson|we don't think you're slow .
marge simpson|there's that .
marge simpson|or , you could take an adult education course .
marge simpson|that's because you were drunk !
marge simpson|you've ruined a perfectly good jacket .
marge simpson|whatever do you mean ?
marge simpson|i don't dye my hair ...
marge simpson|i don't know what you're talking about .
marge simpson|that's nice .
marge simpson|homer , i really don't like you telling personal secrets in your class .
marge simpson|today at the kwikemart everybody knew i dyed my hair .
marge simpson|mmhmm .
marge simpson|i'm happy about that .
marge simpson|but , i think you can be a good teacher and still respect our privacy .
marge simpson|homer , don't ever tell them personal stuff about me again .
marge simpson|homer , don't you have to get to class ?
marge simpson|oh , well that will be ...
marge simpson|what the darn ...

marge simpson|get out !
marge simpson|get out !
marge simpson|get out !
marge simpson|you , too .
marge simpson|get out !
marge simpson|you just don't get it , do you , homer ?
marge simpson|you told personal things about our lives even after you promised you wouldn't .
marge simpson|i can't trust you anymore .
marge simpson|kids , your father and i are going through a really tough time right now .
marge simpson|but , isn't that a sin ?
marge simpson|funny ...
marge simpson|the way everything reminds me of homer .
marge simpson|oh my .
marge simpson|i'm very flattered , but i'm not really interested .
marge simpson|why don't you come inside for a drink of water ?
marge simpson|here's your water , moe .
marge simpson|homer , what happened to you ?
marge simpson|oh , here , let me help you .
marge simpson|homer , that's not a good thing .
marge simpson|but , how do i know i can trust you ?
marge simpson|i must admit , you really do make a gal feel needed .
marge simpson|homer , the fridge wasn't meant to be used this way .
marge simpson|although i must say , it's certainly refreshing .
marge simpson|won't this overload the motor ?
marge simpson|is it true we should wait at least an hour after eating before we go in ?
marge simpson|who could that be ...
marge simpson|bart ...
marge simpson|are all these children friends of yours ?
marge simpson|oh , look .
marge simpson|there's bart .
marge simpson|wave to him .
marge simpson|hmm , maybe we should spend more time with bart .
marge simpson|he's becoming isolated and weird .
marge simpson|this was a lovely idea , homie .
marge simpson|come here and kiss me .
marge simpson|i wish you'd stop spreading bad rumors about people .
marge simpson|remember how you got grampa tarred and feathered ?
marge simpson|my , these seas are certainly heaving .
marge simpson|does that earring mean you're a pirate ?
marge simpson|lisa , stop blowing my sex !
marge simpson|i mean , stop blowing your sax .
marge simpson|your sax .
marge simpson|stop it .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , but i sacrificed a very expensive camera just to get some quiet time .
marge simpson|what !
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|i don't know , honey .
marge simpson|i guess that's the school's decision to make .
marge simpson|lisa !
marge simpson|i am nice .
marge simpson|homer , i really appreciate you making dinner , but this food tastes a little strange .
marge simpson|but the grocery store sells sugar for thirtyfive cents a pound .
marge simpson|well , you'll always be number one to me ...
marge simpson|uh ...
marge simpson|i meant , my number one girl .
marge simpson|oh , for chri ...
marge simpson|honey , if you get too competitive you'll never be happy .
marge simpson|no matter how good you are there's always gonna be someone better than you .
marge simpson|i always thought i had the tallest hair .
marge simpson|but that trip to graceland really opened my eyes .
marge simpson|believe me , honey .
marge simpson|she's more scared of you than you are of her .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|homer , homer !
marge simpson|i want you to forget about guarding this stupid sugar .
marge simpson|you're being completely paranoid .
marge simpson|homer , when are you gonna give up this crazy sugar scheme ?
marge simpson|look , just get rid of the sugar , okay ?
marge simpson|i'm sorry , homie .
marge simpson|this romance is so full of heartfelt passion .
marge simpson|i can really identify with this cornfed heroine .
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|are you awake ?
marge simpson|this is important , give me some sign you're awake .
marge simpson|wake up !
marge simpson|homie , do you think that the romance has gone out of our lives ?
marge simpson|wake up !
marge simpson|it's nine thirty p .
marge simpson|m .
marge simpson|and you spent your whole saturday drinking beer in maggie's kiddy pool .
marge simpson|i can hit that one pin all right .
marge simpson|but the rest of them don't even wobble .
marge simpson|i want us to deal with the issues raised by this book .
marge simpson|i knew i shouldn't have put a fireplace in the bedroom .
marge simpson|how many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon ?
marge simpson|it's time to learn about love .
marge simpson|i mean romance not love .
marge simpson|that's not true .
marge simpson|romance is all around us .
marge simpson|in our neighborhoods ...
marge simpson|even on our jobs ...
marge simpson|all you have to do is think about your most cherished memories .
marge simpson|no , no , no .
marge simpson|no , ask your heart what its fondest desire is .
marge simpson|no , think about people .
marge simpson|about moments in your life that have been very romantic .
marge simpson|that's not the idea at all .
marge simpson|okay , well this story isn't ideal , i've never told it to you before .
marge simpson|i got a very thoughtless birthday present from someone who shall remain nameless .
marge simpson|so i actually went to the bowling alley to spite him , or her ...
marge simpson|oh !
marge simpson|i'm awfully sorry .
marge simpson|oh , no , no .
marge simpson|homer is my ...
marge simpson|ball's name .
marge simpson|i'm marge .
marge simpson|no ...
marge simpson|no , thank you , mr .
marge simpson|uh ...
marge simpson|brunswick .
marge simpson|jacques .
marge simpson|hmmm .
marge simpson|sure .
marge simpson|never .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|oh , i don't want to trouble you .
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|but i'm not very good .
marge simpson|oh !
marge simpson|but ...
marge simpson|you're a very good teacher !
marge simpson|you didn't have to drop me off .
marge simpson|oh , jacques , i'm a married woman .
marge simpson|what's brunch ?
marge simpson|you didn't have to drop me off .
marge simpson|he seemed to know a lot about brunch .
marge simpson|but it turned out he wasn't interested in brunch at all .
marge simpson|that doesn't shock me .
marge simpson|is thursday okay ?
marge simpson|thank goodness i drove down an ironic street .
marge simpson|okay , homer .
marge simpson|this was a wonderful idea , homie .
marge simpson|yes , what did happen to her ?
marge simpson|good .
marge simpson|does anyone else have a love story ?
marge simpson|lisa , not all romances turn out that way .
marge simpson|bart , do you have a love story that doesn't end in heartbreak ?
marge simpson|well , as jerry lee lewis would say there's a whole lotta frowning going on .
marge simpson|of course .
marge simpson|remember when ...
marge simpson|your aunt selma got married ?
marge simpson|oh , wait , wait , that's no good .
marge simpson|i know , your grandfather .
marge simpson|it all started on an outing for dinner ...
marge simpson|say !
marge simpson|i've got a neat idea .
marge simpson|that's not my mother .
marge simpson|they hit it off right away .
marge simpson|but there were rivals for the fair lady's hand ...
marge simpson|but in the end , just when things looked worse , true love triumphed .
marge simpson|i give up .
marge simpson|did anybody learn anything about love tonight ?
marge simpson|there's that side of it .
marge simpson|but there's also ...
marge simpson|help me out here , lisa .
marge simpson|well , kids , i tried .
marge simpson|maybe you're right .
marge simpson|gee , artie .
marge simpson|artie wait .
marge simpson|i don't know .
marge simpson|i mean , it was it was a beautiful evening .
marge simpson|let's not ruin it .
marge simpson|artie , please !
marge simpson|no , oh , artie !
marge simpson|now , really , i mean it .
marge simpson|now stop it !
marge simpson|take me home , artie .
marge simpson|yeah , right .
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|yeah , you want a ride ?
marge simpson|my prom date .
marge simpson|why so glum ?
marge simpson|mmmm , homie ...
marge simpson|see kids , that's what i meant by romance .
marge simpson|no , i've already planned our vacation .
marge simpson|we're going to the highway 9 bird sanctuary .
marge simpson|i understand they've installed a new bird feeder this year .
marge simpson|it's shaped like a diner .
marge simpson|and it's on this really tall pole .
marge simpson|hmm ?
marge simpson|oooh .
marge simpson|reciperelated bumper cars .
marge simpson|now wait a minute .
marge simpson|i'm not sure about this .
marge simpson|you have to promise me that this isn't going to happen this time .
marge simpson|well , there was our trip to the amish country ...
marge simpson|even worse was our trip to sandy beach .
marge simpson|and remember , every morning give one bowl of kibble to santa's little helper .
marge simpson|do you want me to write any of this down ?
marge simpson|what's the matter with you , homer ?
marge simpson|we don't have any fruits or vegetables in the car .
marge simpson|we'd better find a motel and stop for the night .
marge simpson|homer , no .
marge simpson|you're going to get lost .
marge simpson|such a violent motif .
marge simpson|oh , please .
marge simpson|it was just a figure of speech .
marge simpson|when do you show the consequences ?
marge simpson|on tv , that mouse pulled out that cat's lungs and played them like a bagpipe .
marge simpson|but in the next scene , the cat was breathing comfortably .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|we just got here and already i'm mortified beyond belief by your embarrassing behavior .
marge simpson|oh , i see .
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|i'll have the baby guts .
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|you're sure she'll have fun here ?
marge simpson|tortureland , explosion land , searing gas pain land , unnecessary surgery land ...
marge simpson|it's cute , but i'm sure it's very sharp , and probably dirty .
marge simpson|see all that stuff in there , homer ?
marge simpson|that's why your robot never worked .
marge simpson|this is just what i was hoping for .
marge simpson|spending the day together as a family .
marge simpson|yuhhuh .
marge simpson|i'm sure we'll appreciate each other all the more when we meet up at dinner .
marge simpson|are you kids gonna be alright ?
marge simpson|kids ?
marge simpson|hey , the bartender even looks like john travolta .
marge simpson|it must be wonderful to ring in the new year over and over and over .
marge simpson|i want all five tshirts to say , best vacation ever .
marge simpson|i'm so embarrassed .
marge simpson|i wish there was a hole i could just crawl into and die .
marge simpson|stay away from me , homer !
marge simpson|i have nothing to say to you .
marge simpson|how were you a political prisoner ?
marge simpson|oh for gosh sakes , what now ?
marge simpson|i knew we should have gone to the bird sanctuary .
marge simpson|oh my , it looks like we're doomed !
marge simpson|i don't approve of that .
marge simpson|are you two bonkers ?
marge simpson|we almost got killed , not to mention all the embarrassment i suffered .
marge simpson|you know , you're right .
marge simpson|this truly was the best vacation ever .
marge simpson|now , let us never speak of it again .
marge simpson|oh my .
marge simpson|lisa , go to your room .
marge simpson|this sounds awfully controversial .
marge simpson|lisa , you know i don't like controversy in this house .
marge simpson|bart , i wish you wouldn't lie like that .
marge simpson|homer , we've got to stop them .
marge simpson|homer , did you remember to lock the front door of the house ?
marge simpson|when you locked the front door , did you remember to lock the back door ?
marge simpson|homer , i'm impressed .
marge simpson|you're taking this quite well .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|we're just gonna have to wait and see .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homie ?
marge simpson|hm ...
marge simpson|what he's typed will be a window into his madness .
marge simpson|feelin' fine , well , that's a relief .
marge simpson|this is less encouraging .
marge simpson|go crazy ?
marge simpson|you stay here 'til you're no longer insane .
marge simpson|mmmm , chili would be good tonight .
marge simpson|hello , police ?
marge simpson|this is marge simpson .
marge simpson|my husband is on a murderous rampage .
marge simpson|over .
marge simpson|no answer .
marge simpson|oh my , i hope that rug was scotchguarded .
marge simpson|dad !
marge simpson|daaadd !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|it's bliiiiisssss .
marge simpson|donut ?
marge simpson|what's a donut ?
marge simpson|hmph .
marge simpson|it's raining again .
marge simpson|good morning , dear .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|the sky is blue .
marge simpson|donuts are plentiful .
marge simpson|friday is tgif night on abc .
marge simpson|what's gotten into you ?
marge simpson|listen , kids .
marge simpson|you're eight and ten years old now .
marge simpson|i can't be fighting all your battles for you .
marge simpson|no buts .
marge simpson|relax , honey .
marge simpson|you were just having a crazy nightmare .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|lisa !
marge simpson|time for church .
marge simpson|you just answered your own question with that commode mouth .
marge simpson|i don't want you playing with something that has such bizarre hair .
marge simpson|awful , awful hair .
marge simpson|oh that's sweet , homer .
marge simpson|our son is growing up , isn't he ?
marge simpson|have you noticed any change in bart ?
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|he looks like something might be disturbing him .
marge simpson|i guess we could get more involved in bart's activities .
marge simpson|but then i'd be afraid of smothering him .
marge simpson|that's not what i meant .
marge simpson|time for church , bart .
marge simpson|i bet your little friend jessica will be there .
marge simpson|thirty cents off shake 'n bake .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homer , stop that .
marge simpson|i believe him .
marge simpson|that's what he wore to church .
marge simpson|bart honey , do you know who did take the money ?
marge simpson|we really shouldn't have let them do this .
marge simpson|it can't be helping his self esteem .
marge simpson|uh , i think you all owe my son an apology .
marge simpson|lisa , your father and i are very concerned about this warning .
marge simpson|i really hope you try harder .
marge simpson|cheer up .
marge simpson|so you're not good at sports .
marge simpson|it's a very small part of life .
marge simpson|i think lisa needs to feel a little special tonight .
marge simpson|how about letting her ride up front , too ?
marge simpson|look at milhouse's teeth .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i can't even watch .
marge simpson|absolutely , honey .
marge simpson|by blocking the net i really think you helped your team .
marge simpson|bart , i can spend some time with you .
marge simpson|don't have a stereotypical view of me just because i'm your mother .
marge simpson|i know .
marge simpson|how about we play the basketball ?
marge simpson|i'm no harvey globetrotter , but ...
marge simpson|hey , watch out for the shaqattack !
marge simpson|i told you to watch out .
marge simpson|lemme give my special little winner a big , big hug .
marge simpson|hm , i better go check that out .
marge simpson|now homer , don't you eat this pie .
marge simpson|stop it !
marge simpson|stop it !
marge simpson|stop it !
marge simpson|stop it !
marge simpson|stop it !
marge simpson|i don't care who started it .
marge simpson|i don't ever want to see you two fighting like that ever again .
marge simpson|we love you both .
marge simpson|you're not in competition with each other .
marge simpson|repeat .
marge simpson|you are not in competition with each other .
marge simpson|i won't have any aggressive condiment passing in this house .
marge simpson|you caught me at a real bad time , moe .
marge simpson|i hope you understand i'm too tense to pretend i like you .
marge simpson|moe , i think you should leave .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|homer , we can't root for one child over the other .
marge simpson|you wouldn't like it if the kids played favorites with us .
marge simpson|he tripped my boy .
marge simpson|i demand vengeance !
marge simpson|i want vengeance !
marge simpson|i've never been so proud of them .
marge simpson|oh , well thank you homer .
marge simpson|but take one of the kids .
marge simpson|homer , are all these pockets necessary ?
marge simpson|well , that's the babysitter .
marge simpson|no one in town will sit for you two anymore .
marge simpson|i had to choose between a grad student at the university and a scarylooking hobo .
marge simpson|well there's also a baby somewhere upstairs !
marge simpson|will you two stop saying gummy so much .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i won't make a spectacle out of myself any further .
marge simpson|oooh ...
marge simpson|how'd they get there ?
marge simpson|i'm sure it'll turn up .
marge simpson|take the babysitter home now .
marge simpson|she's been sitting in the car for twenty minutes .
marge simpson|well why don't we give it to some needy children , then ?
marge simpson|some of their chants are very catchy and memorable .
marge simpson|they seem to be building some sort of a shantytown .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|wake up !
marge simpson|wake up !
marge simpson|i already talked to the indignation coordinator out on the lawn today .
marge simpson|i told her you were a decent man .
marge simpson|but she wouldn't listen .
marge simpson|besides standing by you and supporting you , there isn't anything more i can do .
marge simpson|homer , that's your solution to everything , to move under the sea .
marge simpson|it's not gonna happen .
marge simpson|look , maybe this whole thing will blow over .
marge simpson|yes , yes , yes .
marge simpson|that's fine .
marge simpson|good , good .
marge simpson|oh really ?
marge simpson|i hope you kept the homie fires burning ...
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|the kids have a great idea on how you can clear your name !
marge simpson|well , we can dress it up a bit .
marge simpson|we can bring a fern ...
marge simpson|and a folding chair from the garage ...
marge simpson|and the most decorative thing of all the truth .
marge simpson|there are only fortynine stars on that flag .
marge simpson|groundskeeper willie saved you , homer .
marge simpson|hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything you hear ?
marge simpson|is there something wrong , homie ?
marge simpson|don't turn on the light !
marge simpson|don't turn on the light !
marge simpson|oh , bart .
marge simpson|it's just an old golf umbrella stuck in a tree .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|we need to talk about the ...
marge simpson|marital difficulties we've been having lately .
marge simpson|i simply can't wait that long .
marge simpson|maybe we should get some help ...
marge simpson|how 'bout a book ?
marge simpson|a tasteful book .
marge simpson|shh .
marge simpson|i don't want people to see us looking at these books .
marge simpson|oh , i'm just reading up on , artillery .
marge simpson|this one's a good choice , and it's not too smutty .
marge simpson|sane planning sensible tomorrow .
marge simpson|homeie , i can't quite ...
marge simpson|so am i .
marge simpson|kids ?
marge simpson|kids ?
marge simpson|the arabian nights room looks nice ...
marge simpson|this isn't very erotic .
marge simpson|i think it's an actual utility room .
marge simpson|here he is , rex harrison and paul anka rolled into one !
marge simpson|that tonic really works !
marge simpson|you and grampa should bottle it and go into business together .
marge simpson|you could make a lot of money .
marge simpson|you threw them out the window in a fit of passion .
marge simpson|you said you were never going to need them again .
marge simpson|homie , are you really going to ignore grampa for the rest of your life ?
marge simpson|you didn't want to have bart .
marge simpson|you tell bart all the time .
marge simpson|you told him this morning .
marge simpson|what if you pretended that this couch were a bar ?
marge simpson|then you could spend more nights at home with us .
marge simpson|huh ?
marge simpson|i just left my first session and i haven't even opened my mouth yet .
marge simpson|i don't know , homer .
marge simpson|we're right in the middle of the busy housekeeping season .
marge simpson|oh , i forgot to clean the lint basket in the dryer .
marge simpson|if someone broke into the house and did laundry , it could start a fire .
marge simpson|i think i'll go get a picture of the plane taking off .
marge simpson|homer , i've never told you this before , but i'm not a good flyer .
marge simpson|i have to get off the plane .
marge simpson|let me off the plane .
marge simpson|i'm asking you nicely to open the doors .
marge simpson|let me off !
marge simpson|let me off !
marge simpson|let me off !
marge simpson|let me off !
marge simpson|let me off !
marge simpson|let me off !
marge simpson|let me off !
marge simpson|let me off !
marge simpson|let me off !
marge simpson|let me off !
marge simpson|let me off !
marge simpson|let me off !
marge simpson|let me off !
marge simpson|yes , but i'd rather not talk about it .
marge simpson|well , everybody's got a fear of something .
marge simpson|sock puppets .
marge simpson|sure as sugar .
marge simpson|i just realized we never had a wedding for the cat and the dog .
marge simpson|they've been living in sin .
marge simpson|judge , jury , and executioner all rolled into one , you are .
marge simpson|no , no honey , it's all right .
marge simpson|really .
marge simpson|i'm fine .
marge simpson|i'm all right .
marge simpson|mother always said don't complain .
marge simpson|be good .
marge simpson|behave , behave .
marge simpson|be nice , smile be polite , don't make waves .
marge simpson|in a little while .
marge simpson|can't talk .
marge simpson|keeping myself in a state of catlike readiness .
marge simpson|mm , no , i don't need therapy , i'm fine .
marge simpson|and it's too expensive .
marge simpson|but i ...
marge simpson|thirty dollars will be fine .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , doctor .
marge simpson|he's just afraid you'll blame all my problems on him .
marge simpson|but it's a few seconds before 1200 .
marge simpson|hmm .
marge simpson|that would have to be my first day of school .
marge simpson|the kids at school were even worse .
marge simpson|they do so !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|but it's true .
marge simpson|they didn't write their own songs or play their own instruments .
marge simpson|i don't think so .
marge simpson|i keep having the same dream .
marge simpson|i'm the mother from lost in space .
marge simpson|ready for breakfast , doctor smith ?
marge simpson|wait !
marge simpson|daddy !
marge simpson|wait !
marge simpson|please don't leave .
marge simpson|take me with you !
marge simpson|no , i didn't .
marge simpson|sure , okay .
marge simpson|i'll talk about father .
marge simpson|father christmas .
marge simpson|that's what they call santa claus in england .
marge simpson|they drive on the wrong side of the road there .
marge simpson|now that's crazy .
marge simpson|people are always saying how small england is .
marge simpson|but you couldn't fit it all in here .
marge simpson|not by a long shot .
marge simpson|you know what ?
marge simpson|i'm cured .
marge simpson|okay .
marge simpson|okay ...
marge simpson|but you're gonna make a big deal outta this .
marge simpson|he was a pilot .
marge simpson|you see .
marge simpson|wait .
marge simpson|i'm remembering something ...
marge simpson|i was a little girl ...
marge simpson|why does daddy have to leave ?
marge simpson|i want to see daddy fly !
marge simpson|daddy ?
marge simpson|daddy , where are you , da ...
marge simpson|daddy ?
marge simpson|my father was a stewardess .
marge simpson|they are ?
marge simpson|yeah ...
marge simpson|you might even say he was an american hero .
marge simpson|wait , some other stuff's coming back to me .
marge simpson|you think those could also have contributed to my fear of flying ?
marge simpson|oh well , thank you , doctor , you've changed my life !
marge simpson|thank you , doctor .
marge simpson|whenever the wind whistles through the leaves i'll think lowenstein , lowenstein .
marge simpson|lowenstein .
marge simpson|could you start fixing it pretty soon ?
marge simpson|the basement is getting awfully flooded .
marge simpson|and i think the cat's down there .
marge simpson|oh dear .
marge simpson|oh , homer .
marge simpson|don't start stalking people again .
marge simpson|it's so illegal .
marge simpson|remember when you were stalking charles kuralt because you thought he dug up your garden ?
marge simpson|i don't want you stalking anyone tonight .
marge simpson|everyone likes you .
marge simpson|you're a wonderful person .
marge simpson|i'm sure it's nothing personal , homer .
marge simpson|kids can be so cruel .
marge simpson|i know , i know .
marge simpson|you certainly are popular now that you're a stonecutter .
marge simpson|you're not a god , homer .
marge simpson|aw , homie .
marge simpson|you know , you are a member of a very exclusive club .
marge simpson|homer , you can't just keep hanging out with these colobus monkeys .
marge simpson|somebody's gonna get parasites .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|the family simpson , which has just five members .
marge simpson|and only two of those members have special rings .
marge simpson|i meant our wedding rings .
marge simpson|all right , all right .
marge simpson|it's lisa's turn .
marge simpson|okay , tv off .

marge simpson|no , homie .
marge simpson|you see .
marge simpson|you see , this is the stuff i've been telling you about that you never see .

marge simpson|i think we should call a town meeting .
marge simpson|if we don't do something soon , we won't get any tourists at all .
marge simpson|i'm marge simpson , and i have an idea .
marge simpson|now i know you haven't liked some of my past suggestions .
marge simpson|like switching to the metric system ...
marge simpson|but my new idea is different .
marge simpson|i think we should hold a film festival and give out prizes .
marge simpson|yes !
marge simpson|you like my idea ?
marge simpson|actually , i have several others ...
marge simpson|i'm looking for a film critic to help judge our festival .
marge simpson|dear mr sherman .

marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|it's time to vote for the grand prize .
marge simpson|second .
marge simpson|why don't we all take a five minute break ?
marge simpson|it'll clear our heads .
marge simpson|i knew this would happen .
marge simpson|i put you on the jury and you vote for the stupidest film .
marge simpson|well , homer .
marge simpson|homie , you voted for the right movie .
marge simpson|i'm glad you were on the jury .
marge simpson|well , it was a lovely festival .
marge simpson|the best movie won and mr burns found there are some awards that can't be bought .

marge simpson|hello !
marge simpson|how're you doing in england ?

marge simpson|oh , milhouse doesn't count .
marge simpson|here .
marge simpson|all right , who broke my vase ?
marge simpson|well , i'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves , now did they ?
marge simpson|i think there's really something wrong with santa's little helper .
marge simpson|he was up barking all night and dug up the back yard worse than ever .
marge simpson|yes , the dog ...
marge simpson|excuse me , we're having a problem with our dog ...
marge simpson|no , no , our dog is out of control .
marge simpson|he's wild , destructive , and has little or no respect for authority .
marge simpson|homer , hold on to the wheel !
marge simpson|oh , this place is so big .
marge simpson|do you think we should split up and look for them , homie ?
marge simpson|homie ?
marge simpson|she's the fastest ...
marge simpson|homer , i don't think that means necessarily ...
marge simpson|uhoh ...
marge simpson|i think they're in love .
marge simpson|but she's not our dog .
marge simpson|but won't you miss her loyalty and companionship ?
marge simpson|okay , you can go out and play , but ...
marge simpson|no more you know what in front of the house , all right ?
marge simpson|hey , what did i just say ?
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|don't ever say that word again !
marge simpson|well , i'm going to write the dictionary people and have that checked .
marge simpson|it feels like a mistake to me .
marge simpson|oh , my god !
marge simpson|she's having babies !
marge simpson|oh , i'm sorry , girl .
marge simpson|i thought you were just getting fat .
marge simpson|homer , homer find a place for all these little miracles .
marge simpson|oh , my .
marge simpson|i've never seen anything like this .
marge simpson|oh , homie , aren't they adorable ?
marge simpson|look at branford ii !
marge simpson|isn't that cute ?
marge simpson|he thinks he's one of the models , inc .
marge simpson|well , it's just easier this way .
marge simpson|yeeesch !
marge simpson|this house stinks !
marge simpson|you're not just putting the new newspapers over the old ones , are you ?
marge simpson|all right , we'll give the dogs one more chance .
marge simpson|as long as the puppies don't do anything else wrong , they stay .
marge simpson|on a completely unrelated topic , i'm having a very , very important dinner party tonight .
marge simpson|rev .
marge simpson|lovejoy , your old army drill sergeant , and the regional director of the irs .
marge simpson|we've got to be realistic , kids .
marge simpson|who's gonna have a big enough heart to take care of twentyfive puppies ?
marge simpson|she's right , homer .
marge simpson|there's something about his face i don't trust .
marge simpson|my , he certainly took that well .
marge simpson|dogs !
marge simpson|chief , you're getting powdered sugar all over my floor !
marge simpson|dinner's on , dogs !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|for the love of god , no .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|lisa !
marge simpson|what are you two doing home so early ?
marge simpson|bart , leave that crowbar here .
marge simpson|you know i don't like you prying and jimmying .
marge simpson|honey , maybe you should relax a little ?
marge simpson|i'm worried about the kids , homie .
marge simpson|lisa's becoming very obsessive .
marge simpson|this morning i caught her trying to dissect her own rain coat .
marge simpson|and bart isn't doing very well either .
marge simpson|he needs boundaries , and structure .
marge simpson|there's something about flying a kite at night that's so unwholesome .
marge simpson|that's it .
marge simpson|we have to get them back to school .
marge simpson|hello class .
marge simpson|hi bart .
marge simpson|over here , sweetie .
marge simpson|it's me , mom .
marge simpson|hi .
marge simpson|hey .

marge simpson|i'm bart simpson's mother .
marge simpson|thank you .
marge simpson|ohh ...
marge simpson|kids have been doing that one since my day .
marge simpson|exhausting .
marge simpson|it took the children forty minutes to locate canada on the map .
marge simpson|i'd be thrilled .
marge simpson|you can start right now .
marge simpson|and i'm gonna keep teaching your class .
marge simpson|like it or lump it .
marge simpson|i hate it when he gets in there .
marge simpson|ah , here you go , precious .
marge simpson|now go off with your friends .
marge simpson|that's a very nice jig , kearney .
marge simpson|now , isn't dancing much more fun than bullying ?
marge simpson|bart , are you ready for your history test ?
marge simpson|ok .
marge simpson|who was george washington carver ?
marge simpson|bart , you said you were going to study .
marge simpson|you just don't want to take that test .
marge simpson|homer , this is an operation !
marge simpson|how's my special little guy ?
marge simpson|marge !
marge simpson|but nobody is really gone as long as we remember them .
marge simpson|homer , this is a cemetery .
marge simpson|what do you do , follow my husband around ?
marge simpson|hm , maybe you can get the local jazz station to do a tribute to him .
marge simpson|that's mary had a little lamb .
marge simpson|that's the same thing !
marge simpson|you just replaced dees with doos !
marge simpson|aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture ?
marge simpson|ah , c'mon , homer , there's lasers .
marge simpson|you like lasers .
marge simpson|homie , these games are fixed .
marge simpson|he looks and acts just like the dealer .
marge simpson|i think they're related or at least in cahoots .
marge simpson|homer , he cheated you .
marge simpson|it's people like you who are ruining our downtown promenades and piazzas .
marge simpson|how dare you prey on the greedy and stupid , like this .
marge simpson|somebody stop him !
marge simpson|he's getting away !
marge simpson|c'mon !
marge simpson|c'mon !
marge simpson|weeaah !
marge simpson|see ?
marge simpson|ah , i think i'm okay .
marge simpson|oh for crying out loud ...
marge simpson|lisa , unhand your brother .
marge simpson|well , it was pretty exciting , but celery soup's pretty exciting too .
marge simpson|strange , regular ham doesn't thrill me anymore .
marge simpson|i'm crossing over to deviled ham .
marge simpson|whoa !
marge simpson|thanks benevenstanciano .
marge simpson|death sports .
marge simpson|excuse me ...
marge simpson|actually , i'm interested in becoming a police officer .
marge simpson|you got it , little buddy .
marge simpson|homer , there's no reason for you to feel threatened .
marge simpson|you'll always be the man of this house .
marge simpson|hey everybody , mom's home .
marge simpson|they didn't have my size shirt , but you get the idea .
marge simpson|oh , homie , of course i will .
marge simpson|i suppose i would .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|well , thank you , honey .
marge simpson|homer , give me my pepper spray .

marge simpson|i don't take bribes .
marge simpson|apu , no .
marge simpson|that's better .
marge simpson|i got a report on a domestic disturbance at this address .
marge simpson|umhmmm .
marge simpson|who called the police ?
marge simpson|look , why don't you two settle down .
marge simpson|i'm sure you can get another pillow .
marge simpson|it's for your own safety .
marge simpson|don't stop talking on account of me .
marge simpson|i may be a cop , but i'm still your friend .
marge simpson|so , how are you , mrs krabappel ?
marge simpson|moe , i've never seen you here before .
marge simpson|you don't have to call me officer .
marge simpson|i'm not on duty here .
marge simpson|whoa !
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|uh , a looks nice .
marge simpson|it's a , it's a good length for you .
marge simpson|and that's the drunk tank , and this is mommy's desk .

marge simpson|hello , lisa .
marge simpson|help me bite crime .
marge simpson|ruff , ruff .
marge simpson|illegal gambling in my house ?
marge simpson|i didn't mean to .
marge simpson|i'm still all those things .
marge simpson|everywhere i look , someone is breaking the law .
marge simpson|dog , no leash .
marge simpson|man littering .
marge simpson|horse not wearing diaper .
marge simpson|car parked across three handicapped spaces ...
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homer , i'm on duty .
marge simpson|you have to move your car .
marge simpson|i'm gonna pretend i didn't hear that , but you have to move your car now .
marge simpson|oh , that's it .
marge simpson|i'm gonna write you a ticket .
marge simpson|you're breaking the law .
marge simpson|homer , taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense .
marge simpson|you have the right to remain silent ...
marge simpson|i'm sorry i had to arrest you , homer .
marge simpson|but what i did was right .
marge simpson|i don't think that's a very good idea .
marge simpson|no , it's officer simpson of the police !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|go back to bed !
marge simpson|don't make me come up there !
marge simpson|freeze !
marge simpson|freeze !
marge simpson|every mother knows the secret entrance to her son's tree house .
marge simpson|i don't think so .
marge simpson|that the pants would rip ?
marge simpson|that's it !
marge simpson|there's too much corruption on this force .
marge simpson|i quit !
marge simpson|bart , you've graffitotagged public property .
marge simpson|i can't believe you vandalized your own home town , bart .
marge simpson|what would jebediah springfield say ?
marge simpson|oh , homer , would you please help me make a big deal of this ?
marge simpson|well , i am just shocked by this whole family .
marge simpson|whatever happened to good oldfashioned town pride ?
marge simpson|now just a darned minute !
marge simpson|this town is a part of who you are .
marge simpson|this is a springfield isotopes cap .
marge simpson|when you wear it , you're wearing springfield .
marge simpson|when you eat a fish from our river , you're eating springfield .
marge simpson|when you make lemonade from our trees you're drinking springfield .
marge simpson|bart , you have roots in this town and you ought to show respect for it .
marge simpson|sorry to repeat myself but it'll help you remember .
marge simpson|this town is a part of us all ...
marge simpson|a part of us all ...
marge simpson|a part of us all ...
marge simpson|where you going , bart ?
marge simpson|i choose to take that literally .
marge simpson|it's almost lunch time .
marge simpson|do you know where your brother is tutoring ?
marge simpson|well , do you have a number where we can reach him ?
marge simpson|homer , come quick !
marge simpson|bart's quit his tutoring job and joined a violencegang !
marge simpson|this is my fault .
marge simpson|isn't there anything we can do ?
marge simpson|i'm happy for the school .
marge simpson|it sounds like this money is gonna provide a lot of new opportunities .
marge simpson|i have an idea .
marge simpson|after that , she never forgot him .
marge simpson|holy christmas .
marge simpson|i must say mr burns is being awfully inconsiderate .
marge simpson|selfish , even .
marge simpson|strained carrots for maggie ...
marge simpson|strained carrots for grampa .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|put that down !
marge simpson|guns are very dangerous , and i won't have them in this house .
marge simpson|i'm going to bury it in the yard where little hands can't get to it .
marge simpson|he's causing us all to yell !
marge simpson|that's odd .
marge simpson|where's homer ?
marge simpson|and bart ?
marge simpson|and lisa ?
marge simpson|and grampa ?
marge simpson|where is everybody ?
marge simpson|i don't think we'll ever know who did this .
marge simpson|everyone in town's a suspect .
marge simpson|the police already have a suspect .
marge simpson|it's mr smithers .
marge simpson|i guess it's never the most likely suspect .
marge simpson|i think you're a little young to be investigating an attempted murder .
marge simpson|why don't you try to solve the mystery of who put that mud in the freezer ?
marge simpson|have you seen it ?
marge simpson|i was just asking if you'd seen it .
marge simpson|there's no need to be a prickly pear .
marge simpson|were you talking to me , grampa ?
marge simpson|the police have such a strong case against homer .
marge simpson|mr burns said he did it , they have homer's d .
marge simpson|n .
marge simpson|a ...
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|no , no .
marge simpson|n .
marge simpson|a .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|we can't start thinking that way about our own family members .
marge simpson|suspicion could tear us apart .
marge simpson|if maggie could talk i'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you .
marge simpson|besides , she didn't mean it .
marge simpson|it was an accident .
marge simpson|bart , why are you talking like that ?
marge simpson|growing half an inch in one day is still pretty good , bart .
marge simpson|here's your toast , maggie .
marge simpson|i melbafied it myself .
marge simpson|oh , lisa , honey , i tracked down those old newspapers for your history project .
marge simpson|oh , it was no trouble .
marge simpson|the hobos at the dump were very helpful .
marge simpson|except one man who seemed to have mental problems .
marge simpson|bart , it's class photo day .
marge simpson|no dracula fangs .
marge simpson|no they didn't .
marge simpson|and don't put signs on your sister .
marge simpson|now , keep the lettuce separate until 1130 .
marge simpson|that way , the lettuce stays moist and the bread stays dry !
marge simpson|eh ?
marge simpson|eh ?
marge simpson|you did the right thing by telling me .
marge simpson|shoo !
marge simpson|get outta here !
marge simpson|good for a three hour getaway at the mingled waters health spa .
marge simpson|mineral bath , facial , massage ...
marge simpson|how did you afford these ?
marge simpson|homie , this is so sweet .
marge simpson|but i can't possibly go now ...
marge simpson|what about maggie ?
marge simpson|don't do that !
marge simpson|this is so relaxing .
marge simpson|homie , this was a wonderful idea .
marge simpson|it's like i'm on some wonderful drug !
marge simpson|what's going on here ?
marge simpson|squalid hell hole ...
marge simpson|toilet paper hung in improper overhand fashion ...
marge simpson|dogs mating on dining room table ?
marge simpson|what are you doing with my children ?
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|you can't !
marge simpson|i won't let you !
marge simpson|i can't believe i put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family .
marge simpson|that is so like me .
marge simpson|can you see them ?
marge simpson|that's it .
marge simpson|we're going downtown to get our kids back .
marge simpson|right now !
marge simpson|we've always tried to be good parents .
marge simpson|please , i'm begging you , one mother to another you must have a family .
marge simpson|it's maggie !
marge simpson|this is so humiliating .
marge simpson|it's so quiet here without the kids .
marge simpson|i miss the way bart would say something and then say dude .
marge simpson|you mean maggie ?
marge simpson|we've never been separated from the kids for so long .
marge simpson|i don't know how much more i can take .
marge simpson|there's bart's ring !
marge simpson|well , look at the other side .
marge simpson|oh , my .
marge simpson|the only thing i'm high on is love .
marge simpson|love for my son and daughters .
marge simpson|yes , a little l .
marge simpson|s .
marge simpson|d .

marge simpson|we missed you so much !
marge simpson|he's going to baptize our children ?
marge simpson|where we going ?
marge simpson|where we going ?
marge simpson|oh , maggie , you're a simpson again !
marge simpson|so , what was it like at the flanders' house ?
marge simpson|aw , honey , you're not a monster .
marge simpson|hmm .
marge simpson|bart , what's wrong ?
marge simpson|there's something a little off about your hug .
marge simpson|uh , uh , uh , let me guess .
marge simpson|a mother can always tell .
marge simpson|hmm , it's not fear of nuclear war .
marge simpson|hmm , it's not swim test anxiety .
marge simpson|it almost feels like you're missing something .
marge simpson|something important .
marge simpson|an alligator with sunglasses ?
marge simpson|now i've seen everything !
marge simpson|street signs ?
marge simpson|indoors ?
marge simpson|whatever .
marge simpson|oooh .
marge simpson|these look good .
marge simpson|guiltfree steakfish filets .
marge simpson|ooo , tres bien .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|i think it's nice we're doing something maggie will enjoy for once .
marge simpson|besides , i'm sure storytown village is also fun for everyone ...
marge simpson|from 8 , to ...
marge simpson|god only knows .
marge simpson|this is where the wolf blows down the pigs' house !
marge simpson|that's it , honey .
marge simpson|get into the spirit .
marge simpson|you're supposed to feed them pellets from the machine over there .
marge simpson|oh my .
marge simpson|see ?
marge simpson|it was a good idea to come here after all .
marge simpson|why thank you , homie .
marge simpson|you might say the extra ingredient is salt .
marge simpson|what's wrong lisa ?
marge simpson|didn't you get enough lamb chops ?
marge simpson|bart , sensible bites !
marge simpson|all right lisa .
marge simpson|you don't win friends with salad / you don't win friends with salad ...
marge simpson|i didn't mean to take sides .
marge simpson|i just got caught up in the rhythm .
marge simpson|bart , no !
marge simpson|sorry , force of habit .
marge simpson|lisa , no !
marge simpson|please pass your father the syrup , lisa .
marge simpson|tell him yourself .
marge simpson|you're ignoring lisa , not bart .
marge simpson|homer , you're not not talking to me .
marge simpson|and secondly , i heard what you said .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|where did you get that ?
marge simpson|that giant donut .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|just give him the donut .
marge simpson|once he has it , that will be the end of all this horror .
marge simpson|sometimes .
marge simpson|these monsters are destroying everything and everyone we hold dear !
marge simpson|and you kids should have jackets on .
marge simpson|homer , stop looking !
marge simpson|i don't see what that has to do with groundskeeper willie .
marge simpson|kids , it's time we told you the true story and put your fears to rest .
marge simpson|it's a story of murder and revenge from beyond the grave .

marge simpson|i'd like to , honey , but i'm not sure how .
marge simpson|your father can be surprisingly sensitive .
marge simpson|remember when i giggled at his sherlock holmes hat ?

marge simpson|you're right .
marge simpson|maybe if i use my least nagging tone of voice .

marge simpson|goodnight , sweetheart .
marge simpson|goodnight .
marge simpson|i always thought i understood my special little guy .
marge simpson|but somewhere along the road , his hand slipped away from mine .
marge simpson|he's not my little baby anymore .
marge simpson|maybe i mother him too much .
marge simpson|here's your hot chocolate .
marge simpson|i think you're old enough to do it yourself now .
marge simpson|i didn't think you'd mind .
marge simpson|i figured you were getting a little too old for this .
marge simpson|but you can still make one .
marge simpson|there's some snow left under the car .
marge simpson|we're almost finished .
marge simpson|there's just a little bit of green left .
marge simpson|there you are !
marge simpson|you can help me spray the cookies ...
marge simpson|are you hiding something ?
marge simpson|what do you have under your jacket ?
marge simpson|oh , bart , not again ...
marge simpson|give it to me .
marge simpson|you can't hide from me in this house , bart !
marge simpson|i spend 23 hours a day here !
marge simpson|there's no place left to run , bart .
marge simpson|hand it over .
marge simpson|oh , bart .
marge simpson|i can't believe you did this .
marge simpson|oh , sweetie .
marge simpson|this is the best present a mother could get .
marge simpson|i love you so much , my little bitty barty .
marge simpson|since i got my present early , i think you should get yours early too .
marge simpson|lisa , you have to wait .
marge simpson|homie , you want pork chops ?
marge simpson|those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter .
marge simpson|no , i will not pay you five hundred dollars for sex !
marge simpson|it's sick !
marge simpson|and i don't have that kind of money to spend on sex !
marge simpson|maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team .
marge simpson|like mr burns .
marge simpson|for what ?
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|uhhuh .
marge simpson|ooh .
marge simpson|who knocked down the pins ?
marge simpson|good for him !

marge simpson|he's phenomenal !
marge simpson|wow !
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|where do you pick up words like that ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|watch your mouth !
marge simpson|homer , maybe mr burns will bowl a great game and you will win your championship .
marge simpson|why don't you read something ?
marge simpson|well , you could hand out these flyers for the neighborhood rummage sale .
marge simpson|you'd get some fresh air and exercise .
marge simpson|can we get rid of this ayatollah tshirt ?
marge simpson|khomeini died years ago .
marge simpson|i don't care who's consolidating their power .
marge simpson|well , we don't need this .
marge simpson|who's disco stu ?
marge simpson|are you interested in that motorized tie rack , principal skinner ?

marge simpson|honey , i don't think these clothes are us ...
marge simpson|oh , it's beautiful .
marge simpson|can it be real chanel ?
marge simpson|it is .
marge simpson|90 dollars ?
marge simpson|it fits like a dream , too .
marge simpson|but we can't afford $90 even if it is a bargain .
marge simpson|it wouldn't be right to buy something just for me .
marge simpson|if it were a suit we could all wear , maybe , then ...
marge simpson|oh , sure i do .
marge simpson|i treated myself to a sanka not three days ago .
marge simpson|but this is a real find .
marge simpson|alright , i will buy it .
marge simpson|it'll be good for the economy .
marge simpson|really ?
marge simpson|you like it ?
marge simpson|oh , i'd love to wear this someplace special .
marge simpson|what about the symphony or the theater ?
marge simpson|i used to be a little overwhelmed , too , but it's not that hard .
marge simpson|i can show you .
marge simpson|yeah .
marge simpson|hi , evelyn .
marge simpson|i did marry homer .
marge simpson|ninety percent of the time , if the gas isn't pumping , this is your problem .
marge simpson|we ran with different crowds .
marge simpson|you had your debutante balls and skinnydipping , and i had my home shoe repair course .
marge simpson|bart , comb your hair .
marge simpson|homer , i don't think you should wear a shortsleeved shirt with a tie .
marge simpson|if detective sipowicz jumped off a cliff , would you do that , too ?
marge simpson|i've told you , i don't like you using the word hotbed .
marge simpson|please , lisa , we so rarely get to do things like this .
marge simpson|and everybody everybody , please be on your best behavior .
marge simpson|bart , no grifting .
marge simpson|we're not poor .
marge simpson|well , we're not .

marge simpson|everybody keep smiling , and i know we're going fit right in .
marge simpson|pleased to meet you .
marge simpson|you look like such a happy bunch ...
marge simpson|of people .
marge simpson|oh , that reminds me of a funny apron i saw ...
marge simpson|i get food through the mail , but in a different way .
marge simpson|every month good housekeeping arrives in my mailbox bursting with recipes .
marge simpson|sometimes the most satisfying meal is the one you cook yourself .
marge simpson|didn't everybody have a wonderful time ?
marge simpson|i thought it was so opulent like the playboy mansion , but nonsexual .
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|they're better .
marge simpson|socially better .
marge simpson|and if we fit in , we can be better too .
marge simpson|so good that evelyn gave us a guest pass .
marge simpson|they might even ask us to join !

marge simpson|thank my beautiful new suit .
marge simpson|queen of hearts .
marge simpson|i believe all the rest are ours .
marge simpson|homer , please .
marge simpson|i have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow .
marge simpson|why thank you , roberta .
marge simpson|oh , that would be a dream come true .
marge simpson|i'll be there with bells on !
marge simpson|we can't afford a single slipup .
marge simpson|they're judging us .
marge simpson|i don't know .
marge simpson|lisa , tonight is very important .
marge simpson|mommy has to alter her suit so it looks like a totally new one .
marge simpson|i've already altered this so many times , it's nearly impossible to ...
marge simpson|lisa , please !
marge simpson|nononononooo !
marge simpson|at times like this , i guess all you can do is laugh .
marge simpson|i need a formal dress for tonight !
marge simpson|mmm , it's a bit peppery for me .
marge simpson|why don't we put this in the maybe pile .
marge simpson|uhhuh .
marge simpson|miss ...

marge simpson|c'mon , let's go .
marge simpson|i wouldn't want to join any club that would have this me as a member .
marge simpson|but , you know , we realized we're more comfortable in a place like this .
marge simpson|oh , isn't that somewhat unusual ?
marge simpson|what are you going to spend your money on , kids ?
marge simpson|tacos !
marge simpson|public broadcasting !
marge simpson|i won't have you kids throwing your money away like that .
marge simpson|you're both coming downtown with me and you're gonna put that money in the bank .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|you'll feel better knowing your money's in the hands of professionals .
marge simpson|a professional in an ape mask is still a professional .
marge simpson|checking accounts aren't really for children , bart .
marge simpson|seven hundred dollars .
marge simpson|yes , dear .

marge simpson|wait if i remember my heloise , the trick to getting out gum is peanut butter .

marge simpson|i can't believe there's a place like that in our wholesome little town .
marge simpson|what were you thinking , sending bart to such an awful place ?

marge simpson|a house of loose ethics ...
marge simpson|the house is perfectly fine !
marge simpson|oh , geez it's what's inside the house that's disgraceful drinking , gambling , and debauchery !
marge simpson|it's right under our noses a secret house of burlesque !
marge simpson|i rest my case .
marge simpson|here i come , everybody !
marge simpson|no , i had to go rent the bulldozer .
marge simpson|what about the sleaze and the depravity ?
marge simpson|oh , can you sing it again ?

marge simpson|a magical way for two people to renew their love .
marge simpson|an automatic dialer ?
marge simpson|is that legal ?
marge simpson|i don't want you getting arrested , homer ...
marge simpson|or swindling our neighbors .
marge simpson|but you're going to annoy thousands of people just to make a few measly dollars .
marge simpson|it's nothing but panhandling !
marge simpson|but those women are quitters !
marge simpson|when i first met your father , he was loud , crude , and piggish .
marge simpson|but i worked hard on him , and now he's a whole new person !
marge simpson|he's a whole new person , lisa !
marge simpson|ooh , a rubik's cube .
marge simpson|let's all work it together .

marge simpson|scissors which i need ...
marge simpson|to uh ...

marge simpson|woowoo !
marge simpson|you promised you wouldn't drink !
marge simpson|has anyone seen homer ?
marge simpson|no beer , huh ?
marge simpson|i guess i know what a promise from homer j .
marge simpson|simpson is worth .
marge simpson|your father decided he'd rather come home in a taxi .
marge simpson|or a police car .
marge simpson|i'm cranky because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in front of the entire town .
marge simpson|you broke your promise , homer .
marge simpson|don't soul mate me !
marge simpson|oh , homer , thank goodness you're safe !
marge simpson|i woke up and you weren't there , and i was so worried ...
marge simpson|and i was sure you'd head west , because springfield slopes down that way .
marge simpson|and then i saw the lighthouse , and i remembered how you love blinking lights ...
marge simpson|like the one on the waffle iron ...
marge simpson|yeah .
marge simpson|we had a fight ?
marge simpson|and you're from mars .
marge simpson|homer , don't you see ?
marge simpson|our differences are only skindeep ...

marge simpson|i don't believe you , homer .
marge simpson|you're not listening .
marge simpson|you're only hearing what you want to hear .
marge simpson|homer , please !
marge simpson|i try to be supportive , but this has gone too far .
marge simpson|please just let it be .
marge simpson|please , let's just go to sleep .
marge simpson|no , i'm not .
marge simpson|these shirts are a hundred per cent cotton !
marge simpson|and look at the fine stitching on dope !
marge simpson|oh homie !
marge simpson|homie , i'm so sorry i doubted you !
marge simpson|i'm proud of you , homie .
marge simpson|i'm not wild about these highrisk ventures .
marge simpson|they sound a little risky .
marge simpson|i guess i'm just not comfortable with the whole idea of investing ...
marge simpson|all right , helen , if i'm not wanted , i'll leave .
marge simpson|well , maybe it's all for the best ...
marge simpson|it would be nice to beat those women at their own game .
marge simpson|maybe i should look into a franchise .
marge simpson|well , we're trying to , but you're blocking our way .
marge simpson|now you're the one who's being naive .
marge simpson|oh , i don't want to own my own business .
marge simpson|i don't know why i came here in the first place .
marge simpson|hello , helen .
marge simpson|edna .
marge simpson|uh ...
marge simpson|oh ...
marge simpson|i'm sorry , agnes .
marge simpson|look at them .
marge simpson|they've jumped on the one franchise i might possibly have considered thinking about becoming interested in .
marge simpson|i'm not cut out for the world of business .
marge simpson|mmm ...
marge simpson|hmm ...
marge simpson|that's not bad .
marge simpson|your franchise , how much ?

marge simpson|very well .
marge simpson|there must be dozens of great locations in this town .
marge simpson|don't you worry about me .
marge simpson|you see ?
marge simpson|a little persistence and patience paid off .
marge simpson|that'll be 300 dollars .
marge simpson|i should've said limit one per customer .
marge simpson|hang in there , baby .
marge simpson|you said it , kitty .
marge simpson|copyright 1968 ?
marge simpson|hmm .
marge simpson|determined or not , that cat must be long dead .
marge simpson|that's kind of a downer .
marge simpson|here you go free pretzel wagon pretzels for everyone !
marge simpson|one bite and you'll be hooked !
marge simpson|oh , no !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|don't do that !
marge simpson|you're supposed to be tasting them !
marge simpson|i was wrong to have a dream .
marge simpson|wrong as usual .
marge simpson|i mean , if you're nothing special , why kid yourself ?
marge simpson|listen to your mother , kids aim low .
marge simpson|aim so low , no one will even care if you succeed .
marge simpson|dinner's in the oven .
marge simpson|if you want some butter , it's under my face .
marge simpson|hello ?
marge simpson|uh , no , pretzel wagon's no longer three hundred pretzels ?
marge simpson|wait , wait , let me get this down .

marge simpson|oh , oh , you have to push in as you turn .
marge simpson|yeah , that's it .
marge simpson|who are you ?
marge simpson|what are you talking about ?
marge simpson|oh , it just sickens me .
marge simpson|how could you do this to someone you love ?
marge simpson|we're going to do what we do every day .
marge simpson|we're going to make pretzels .
marge simpson|there , that's the last one .
marge simpson|the answer is no .
marge simpson|homie , maybe we should go inside .
marge simpson|oh , i don't hate you for failing .
marge simpson|i love you for trying .
marge simpson|oh , it's just a mob war .
marge simpson|go back to sleep , honey .
marge simpson|don't worry , kids .

marge simpson|bart's right let's none of us have a cow .
marge simpson|all that matters is that the fans of the show liked it .
marge simpson|it's not your fault , homer .
marge simpson|it's those lousy writers .
marge simpson|they make me madder than a , um ...
marge simpson|yak in heat !
marge simpson|so ?

marge simpson|yes , i have something that i'd like to sell .
marge simpson|nooo .
marge simpson|oh , no .
marge simpson|oh , no , no , no , no .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|it's a very , very old figurine .
marge simpson|well , i guess it'll always be a monument to grandma's secret drinking problem ...
marge simpson|pimento nose ...
marge simpson|and voila !
marge simpson|mommy's patented happycracker snack platter !
marge simpson|not really .
marge simpson|they just had corn on them .
marge simpson|kitchen corn .
marge simpson|he is quite a charmer .
marge simpson|your father's certainly taken a shine to him ...
marge simpson|mmm , i don't think he's married , homer .
marge simpson|homer , didn't john seem a little ...
marge simpson|festive to you ?
marge simpson|he prefers the company of men !
marge simpson|sexual .
marge simpson|you're being ridiculous .
marge simpson|i'm very sorry you feel that way .
marge simpson|because john invited us all out for a drive today , and we're going .
marge simpson|what on earth are you talking about ?
marge simpson|homer , at least come out and say hello .
marge simpson|come on .
marge simpson|you liked john this morning .
marge simpson|oh , geez louise , you don't even know what you're worried about anymore .
marge simpson|john's a witty , urbane person .
marge simpson|i hope you all saved room , because i made your favorite dessert storebought snack cakes !
marge simpson|both kinds !
marge simpson|homie , i can hear you chewing on your pillow .
marge simpson|what's wrong ?
marge simpson|so if you wore a hawaiian shirt , it wouldn't be gay ?
marge simpson|homer , i don't think there's a problem with bart .
marge simpson|but if there is , it's probably because you're not spending any time with him .
marge simpson|goodnight .
marge simpson|i don't , but i loved hearing it !
marge simpson|homer , john brought us cactus candy !
marge simpson|oh , homer , please .
marge simpson|you're embarrassing yourself .
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|you never went hunting before , and you're perfectly straight !
marge simpson|oh , homie , i'm so glad you're safe !
marge simpson|hmmm , you feel softer than before .
marge simpson|just remember , bart , convicts aren't cool .
marge simpson|they're bad people .
marge simpson|someone should really go up there and talk to him .
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|oh , you have nothing to worry about , honey .
marge simpson|we're very proud of you , by the way .
marge simpson|but he's safely locked away !
marge simpson|for life !
marge simpson|which is impossible !
marge simpson|how can you even think of releasing sideshow bob ?
marge simpson|bart , no !
marge simpson|you can't ask god to kill someone !
marge simpson|oh , that sounds fabulous , homer .
marge simpson|stores throw the best parties .
marge simpson|you didn't remember that .
marge simpson|you just saw it on tv .
marge simpson|maybe people don't want an eightyearold babysitter , honey .
marge simpson|parents need to be sure their sitter can handle anything that might happen .
marge simpson|that's why they hire teenagers .
marge simpson|uh , grampa's not coming ...
marge simpson|actually , bart , lisa is going to be in charge tonight .
marge simpson|i know she's young , but lisa has proven herself mature and dependable .
marge simpson|well , we have to run .
marge simpson|i'm sure you kids will work things out .
marge simpson|good night !
marge simpson|make sure he brushes his teeth , lisa .
marge simpson|uh , i don't think we should be driving here .
marge simpson|the mayor's yelling at us .
marge simpson|oh , it's so beautiful !
marge simpson|this is what i imagine paris must be like !
marge simpson|i'm so honored that springfield has been chosen to host all these upscale chain stores .
marge simpson|i guess this makes us yuppies , huh , homie ?
marge simpson|oooh , malaria zone !
marge simpson|that's where all the explorers shop .
marge simpson|isn't that clever ?
marge simpson|it looks like a cadillac drove right into the building .
marge simpson|oh my god , you walked into the fountain !
marge simpson|get out of the fountain !
marge simpson|just stand still and i'll get someone !
marge simpson|young lady , you will never babysit again !
marge simpson|i am so disappointed ointed ...
marge simpson|ointed ...
marge simpson|ointed ...
marge simpson|oh , i do .
marge simpson|i'm just a little concerned about the kids .
marge simpson|maybe i should call .
marge simpson|his arm !
marge simpson|oh , my special little guy , are you okay ?
marge simpson|parades just bring out so many emotions in me joy , excitement , looking ...
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|no more drinking !
marge simpson|i'm tired of looking like the world's worst mother .
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|what happened to you , homer ?
marge simpson|and what have you done to the car ?
marge simpson|i don't think it had broken axles before .
marge simpson|that's funny ...
marge simpson|i used to be able to go down there .
marge simpson|why do you have so many bowling balls ?
marge simpson|beer !
marge simpson|you're the one the papers have been talking about .
marge simpson|that mysterious beer baron who's been supplying springfield with alcohol !
marge simpson|how have you been getting away with this ?
marge simpson|homer , that's very clever !
marge simpson|well , it is .
marge simpson|i've known your father since high school and this is the cleverest thing he's ever done .
marge simpson|besides , he's only breaking a silly , twohundredyearold law ...
marge simpson|whooh ...
marge simpson|what on earth happened down there ?
marge simpson|homer , there's no point in pretending you're making those noises .
marge simpson|your homemade liquor is exploding again .
marge simpson|you've made some money and had the fun of being a wanted criminal .
marge simpson|why not quit now , while you're ahead ?
marge simpson|wait !
marge simpson|wait !
marge simpson|you can't do this !
marge simpson|all my husband did was violate a law that doesn't make sense .
marge simpson|our freedom to drink .
marge simpson|krabappel ?
marge simpson|oh , my goodness .
marge simpson|homer , bart's up there !
marge simpson|bills ...
marge simpson|bills ...

marge simpson|and have ten items or less .
marge simpson|oh , now be fair , edna .
marge simpson|skinner .
marge simpson|did you ever tell him that ?

marge simpson|because we couldn't find grampa to sit for them .
marge simpson|movies john travolta made ...
marge simpson|those were the days .
marge simpson|and you knew where you were then ...

marge simpson|ballet lessons ...
marge simpson|they have some fun things you could do at the museum on saturday ...
marge simpson|i guess it doesn't matter .

marge simpson|i cannot believe this .
marge simpson|balzac !

marge simpson|i think we have some money in the air conditioner account again , hmmm ?
marge simpson|you're a good father .
marge simpson|homer , you know how unpredictable the french are .
marge simpson|one minute they're kissing a woman's hand , the next they're chopping off her head .

marge simpson|homie , is that you ?
marge simpson|that sounds beautiful , ned .
marge simpson|friends with mutants , right .
marge simpson|homer , no !
marge simpson|what's going on down there ?

marge simpson|homer , i think you'd agree that i've put up with a lot in this marriage .
marge simpson|i'm a lucky woman .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|you lied to me !
marge simpson|you promised to get rid of this gun !

marge simpson|are you wearing my selfdefense whistle ?
marge simpson|you shouldn't pressure bart like that .
marge simpson|how can you treat him that way ?
marge simpson|don't you remember how bad your father made you feel when you played sports ?
marge simpson|so like i said , i've never had a tick burrow in so deep .
marge simpson|little guy's just got a mind of his own .

marge simpson|all those eyes , just leering and leering at us .
marge simpson|i am !
marge simpson|all you're getting is rubber bands and paper clips ?
marge simpson|don't you need a notebook or something ?
marge simpson|homer , that side of bacon was for my bridge game tonight .
marge simpson|with cans of grease ?
marge simpson|i'm sure they didn't ditch you , honey .
marge simpson|maybe they went off to plan a surprise party for you .
marge simpson|my poor homie .
marge simpson|couldn't you try some other farout moneymaking scheme ?
marge simpson|you could raise some emus ...
marge simpson|lisa ...
marge simpson|i made you some homemade pepsi for the dance .
marge simpson|it's a little thick , but the price is right .
marge simpson|ohh , so you don't have a date .
marge simpson|you can still go and have a wonderful time .
marge simpson|oh , honey .
marge simpson|a baby couldn't have organized a big school dance .
marge simpson|unless it was especially skilled .

marge simpson|you've made me very happy .
marge simpson|you're thirtynine .
marge simpson|the kids and i want to show you all the great things you've done .
marge simpson|well , there's certainly no greater accomplishment than fathering three beautiful children .
marge simpson|that doesn't sound like me .
marge simpson|all right , already !
marge simpson|everyone knows the man accomplished a lot .
marge simpson|maybe because he didn't spend every waking moment talking about thomas edison !
marge simpson|well , you're not thomas edison .
marge simpson|whatever .
marge simpson|i didn't tell you to quit your job .
marge simpson|something electrical might be good .

marge simpson|broke !
marge simpson|you broke your pencil .

marge simpson|tomorrow is laundry day .

marge simpson|homer , watch your lang ...
marge simpson|oooooh .
marge simpson|that's a lifesaver .
marge simpson|stop that !
marge simpson|cigars are for rich people and legendary comedians , like bill crosby and david letterson .

marge simpson|what are you doing , lisa ?
marge simpson|honey , don't get obsessed with that .
marge simpson|focus on the good things .
marge simpson|like this fire extinguisher i got at the fair .
marge simpson|it's the only fire extinguisher endorsed by both lynda carter and george foreman .
marge simpson|i wonder what would happen if they had a baby ?
marge simpson|lisa , you've got to learn that life isn't always fair .
marge simpson|try to channel your disappointment into something creative , like a sampler .

marge simpson|i'm beginning to dislike the man with the whip .
marge simpson|okay , bart .
marge simpson|i'll sweettalk the sheriff , while you grab his keys .

marge simpson|becky , what have i done here ?
marge simpson|i'm so sorry .
marge simpson|becky , i know you must feel awful .
marge simpson|but at least this didn't happen after you were married .
marge simpson|bart , remember that talk we had about you volunteering our house ?
marge simpson|now , lisa's going through this phase where she doesn't eat any meat .
marge simpson|so i usually sneak a little meat juice into her vegetables .
marge simpson|nobody's ever called my gravy yummers before !
marge simpson|ooo , ooo , i've always wanted to use rosemary in something .
marge simpson|thanks to our own spice girl becky .
marge simpson|actually , that was becky , too .

marge simpson|usurper !
marge simpson|don't mess with me , i've got jimmies !
marge simpson|shut up , becky !
marge simpson|there .
marge simpson|i finally said it .
marge simpson|i thought you said the law was powerless .
marge simpson|this isn't over , becky .
marge simpson|i know where you live my house !
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|it was healthy .
marge simpson|he reciprocated .
marge simpson|he reciprocated !
marge simpson|oh ...
marge simpson|i was just praying to god that you'll find me sane .
marge simpson|oh , yes .
marge simpson|he's kind of everywhere .
marge simpson|i'm not insane !
marge simpson|i'm not insane !
marge simpson|now , let's find out who this becky really is .
marge simpson|i really should read the whole headline before i react .
marge simpson|oh , my .
marge simpson|i've been so unfair to becky .
marge simpson|maybe i am insane .
marge simpson|i mean , i am talking to myself .
marge simpson|becky , i want to apologize to you ...
marge simpson|surper !
marge simpson|why you little ...
marge simpson|shot ?

marge simpson|well , that's a relief , too , knowing i'm not crazy .
marge simpson|no they didn't .
marge simpson|oh , i've got too much to do to take a nap right now .
marge simpson|lisa , get maggie out of that cage .
marge simpson|nobody told us how tough it is to raise kids .
marge simpson|they almost drove me to fortified wine !
marge simpson|the malarkeys , dumbin' it down ...
marge simpson|homer kept saying he could do a more realistic family show .
marge simpson|finally , i said , so , do it !
marge simpson|either shit or get off the pot .
marge simpson|i haven't done the laundry yet .
marge simpson|fortunately , i had a network connection .
marge simpson|the man who cut my hair was also president of fox .
marge simpson|we were using fiftydollar bills as toilet paper .
marge simpson|and toilet paper as dog toilet paper .
marge simpson|and just a few stars down from the cheerios honey bee .
marge simpson|hey , you've been riding me all day .
marge simpson|why don't you poop in your hat ?
marge simpson|bart , what do you mean , you have jury duty ?
marge simpson|now homer , this is no time to be thinking about food .
marge simpson|something that swings , with the beat of new orleans .
marge simpson|swings !
marge simpson|you don't have the guts , little man !
marge simpson|stop it !
marge simpson|so , the next time you see a sheriff , shoot him ...
marge simpson|a smile .
marge simpson|good night , laughlin !
marge simpson|oh , save it for your next book , you little snitch !
marge simpson|you just don't say no to the redheaded stranger .
marge simpson|and when i heard it was for awareness , that sealed the deal .
marge simpson|which homer writes himself .
marge simpson|i can't believe it .
marge simpson|we won another contest !
marge simpson|i don't like you ogling her .
marge simpson|why don't you read cathy ?
marge simpson|she's hilarious .

marge simpson|maybe i'd better check mine .
marge simpson|today , your husband will die .
marge simpson|homer , i'm scared .
marge simpson|no dessert until you eat your broccoli .
marge simpson|poor homie .
marge simpson|i still can't believe a piece of broccoli killed you .
marge simpson|homer , it's you !
marge simpson|i thought i'd never see you again .
marge simpson|do you have to talk like that ?
marge simpson|son , i don't like you watching that fire .
marge simpson|it's too violent .
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|oh , why are the oafs always the first to go ?
marge simpson|but husband , without your weekly pittance , how shall we feed our children ?
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|you threw our precious babies into the woods ?
marge simpson|we could have sold them !
marge simpson|go back and get them !
marge simpson|well , we're still poor , but thanks to your father , we'll never go hungry .
marge simpson|but you seemed so happy in the ocean .
marge simpson|all that playful leaping .
marge simpson|geez , so many dolphins ...
marge simpson|oh honey , i wouldn't say doomed .
marge simpson|it's gonna be an adjustment , no question ...
marge simpson|half the town keeps the old 636 area code and our half gets 939 .
marge simpson|geez , you just have to remember three extra numbers .
marge simpson|more wheat cakes , mr mayor ?
marge simpson|that's not true .

marge simpson|they were looking at me .
marge simpson|with their eyes .
marge simpson|we can't go on fighting with olde springfield .

marge simpson|we see them every day .
marge simpson|like the one in berlin ?
marge simpson|homer ...
marge simpson|to be honest , it's a little chilly .
marge simpson|my experiment ?
marge simpson|you're the one who came up with this whole idea ...
marge simpson|don't you two have a list of chores to do ?
marge simpson|homer , what are you doing ?
marge simpson|well , like all americans , fast .
marge simpson|well , you can't argue with results ...

marge simpson|you've gotta take this more seriously .
marge simpson|that's all i ask .

marge simpson|kids it's eight o'clock !
marge simpson|you're gonna miss the bus to wizard school !
marge simpson|that's not good for the clock .

marge simpson|it's about the only thing we do as a family anymore .
marge simpson|uhoh .
marge simpson|and unusual .

marge simpson|you'll get to spend more time together .
marge simpson|make sure your father takes his mood medication .
marge simpson|i can't take it anymore !
marge simpson|well , you can tell she's never had kids .
marge simpson|look how high and firm her breasts are .

marge simpson|i don't want you going in a bottle .
marge simpson|that's what hobos do .
marge simpson|homer , just take him to the bathroom .
marge simpson|oh , homie , no .
marge simpson|we can't .
marge simpson|i don't want him to see us expressing our love .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|i'm sleeping in the bathtub .
marge simpson|she's such a butthole .
marge simpson|don't be mad at homer .
marge simpson|i was the one who cut the rope .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|homer , no !
marge simpson|we're not bad parents .
marge simpson|no , i won't .
marge simpson|and frankly , judge , i think you're a bully .
marge simpson|i don't mean to be disrespectful , judge harm , but we are not bad parents .
marge simpson|haven't we been humiliated enough ?
marge simpson|i just can't do that , homer .
marge simpson|it's a matter of principle .
marge simpson|and i need you to support me in this .
marge simpson|but first we gotta break out of these stocks .
marge simpson|i want goggles , too .
marge simpson|ahh !
marge simpson|concentrate , homer .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|no , there it is !
marge simpson|we hate her , homer .

marge simpson|that's odd .
marge simpson|he's outside , digging .
marge simpson|there's no drugs out there .
marge simpson|bart , this is dr kaufman .
marge simpson|he's a special kind of talking doctor .
marge simpson|running a bar is a fulltime job and you don't even do your fulltime job .
marge simpson|i thought this was gonna be your bar .
marge simpson|ooh ...
marge simpson|it must be chinese new year .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|every house has a bathroom .
marge simpson|it's about time mr burns found a woman .
marge simpson|i can't stand to see a man single .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|everyone should be paired up .
marge simpson|it wasn't meant to be .
marge simpson|new underpants ?
marge simpson|homer , what are you up to ?
marge simpson|well , don't look too hip .
marge simpson|you don't want that girl falling for you .
marge simpson|that was amazing .
marge simpson|i hope the kids didn't hear us .
marge simpson|devil beard ?

marge simpson|putting away groceries it's like unwrapping presents from yourself .
marge simpson|fruit rollups for bart ...
marge simpson|beer rollups for homer ...

marge simpson|well , is anything coming back to you ?
marge simpson|you found a corpse when you were twelve ?
marge simpson|no wonder you've been so traumatized .
marge simpson|maybe there's murder afoot !
marge simpson|maybe .
marge simpson|thanks for understanding .
marge simpson|maybe we should come back in the daytime .
marge simpson|chief wiggum !
marge simpson|water , eh ?
marge simpson|burly to the rescue !
marge simpson|but whose body is it ?
marge simpson|homer , shouldn't we give that skull to mr smithers ?
marge simpson|lisa , don't sulk .

marge simpson|our plan worked perfectly .
marge simpson|i'm so proud of us .
marge simpson|when we stick together , we can do anything .
marge simpson|why do you always wait 'til we arrive to complain ?
marge simpson|lisa , you're not buying more than your weight in books .

marge simpson|the duff book of world records .
marge simpson|it's got pictures of deformities .
marge simpson|i never agreed to that rule !

marge simpson|look at all the empty calories .
marge simpson|ooo , sugar free donuts .
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|apu , everything in this store is overloaded with sugar .

marge simpson|hey !
marge simpson|but we're on hiatus .
marge simpson|everyone's everywhere .
marge simpson|i'll play it later .
marge simpson|if you looked up meaniebeaniefofeanie in the dictionary , you'd see his picture .
marge simpson|there was one in a cage , but he wasn't moving .
marge simpson|that company's ruining the whole town's health , and i don't know how to stop them .
marge simpson|oh yeah , like erin brockovich .
marge simpson|i'm not sure i can afford a fancy lawyer .
marge simpson|aw , hop in .
marge simpson|we want to sue the sugar industry for selling a harmful product .
marge simpson|don't worry .
marge simpson|i'll do the legwork .

marge simpson|that's the best one !
marge simpson|oh honey , think pink .
marge simpson|look , a salute to safe sex !
marge simpson|wouldn't it be great if that man and woman got together ?

marge simpson|homer , you're going to get in trouble .
marge simpson|so your life is ruined .
marge simpson|oh dear , you can't eat solid foods .
marge simpson|those are his favorites .
marge simpson|stop it , homer !

marge simpson|how was your day ?
marge simpson|do you really want to know ?
marge simpson|well , let's see ...
marge simpson|i was in the kitchen , counting the corncobs on the curtains ...
marge simpson|when who should ring the doorbell but ned flanders .
marge simpson|it seems he wants to ban culottes in the schools .
marge simpson|pardon my french , but sometimes that man's a goofydoofy .
marge simpson|you know , tomorrow is the annual springfield formal event .
marge simpson|we weren't going to go , after last year's ...
marge simpson|unpleasantness .
marge simpson|that donkey is such a bad influence on you .

marge simpson|i don't know what you said , but i'm sure it was beautiful .

marge simpson|he did such crazy things roll clip .
marge simpson|please , homie ?
marge simpson|no more craziness for me ?

marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|well , i think westerns are due for a comeback .
marge simpson|you care about bart's feelings .

marge simpson|have we gotten all the liquor ?
marge simpson|well , we're not giving up .
marge simpson|we're going to cure you of drinking .

marge simpson|sharing your allowance with a poor brazilian boy .
marge simpson|how come you talked for four hundred dollars ?
marge simpson|that's right .
marge simpson|they have powers .

marge simpson|homie , you don't need drugs anymore .
marge simpson|your eyes are all better .
marge simpson|homer , it's over .
marge simpson|why are you keeping that thing ?
marge simpson|don't worry , homer .
marge simpson|you don't need mary jane to laugh at mr burns' jokes .
marge simpson|just picture him naked .
marge simpson|or , or , um , with , with a funny hat on .
marge simpson|now before we get there , you have to put this blindfold on .
marge simpson|homer , these people are professional roasters .
marge simpson|don't give them fodder !

marge simpson|i like little dot .
marge simpson|could you rip that off ?
marge simpson|i mean , who's gonna know ?
marge simpson|hm , that little girl sure loved dots .
marge simpson|homer , what are you doing ?

marge simpson|okay .
marge simpson|are you sure you can get your deposit back ?
marge simpson|it's in pretty bad shape .
marge simpson|homie , what's wrong ?

marge simpson|hm .
marge simpson|something you did ?
marge simpson|no , something you saw .
marge simpson|apu is having an affair ?
marge simpson|how did you find out ?
marge simpson|oh , this is so awkward .
marge simpson|today's the day we play badminton with them .
marge simpson|oh , i hope no one makes any double entendres .
marge simpson|no , no , no , let's just keep playing .
marge simpson|what's the score ?
marge simpson|we have to do something to save that marriage .
marge simpson|maybe i should just tell manjula .
marge simpson|or you could talk to apu ...
marge simpson|what would that accomplish ?
marge simpson|homie , it's eleven at night .
marge simpson|have you told him yet ?
marge simpson|tell that woman it's over between you and her .
marge simpson|sure .
marge simpson|is that windex ?
marge simpson|kids , we want to talk to you about something .
marge simpson|i just wish there was something we could do ...
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|oh , homer , are you thinking what i'm thinking ?
marge simpson|i keep telling you .
marge simpson|off camera , he's a desperately unhappy man .
marge simpson|manjula , we've got a special guest for you .
marge simpson|even better .
marge simpson|look who's here .
marge simpson|it's this thing !
marge simpson|manjula , come quick !
marge simpson|the octuplets said their first words .
marge simpson|they miss their father .
marge simpson|are you sure you don't want to take him back ?
marge simpson|all right !
marge simpson|girls night out !
marge simpson|exotic male dancers at the golden banana !
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|then i shred the list and put it in his food .
marge simpson|at the golden banana ?
marge simpson|i know a great nametag place .
marge simpson|they do fabulous work .
marge simpson|look lisa , there's an opening .
marge simpson|my little munchkin bumped her pumpkin .
marge simpson|what's wrong with him , doctor ?
marge simpson|it can't be mange , i just had him dipped .
marge simpson|i knew it was serious when he said he didn't want ice cream .
marge simpson|well , your father ate it all .
marge simpson|you'll get the hang of it .
marge simpson|today's just a little gusty .
marge simpson|bart , don't slurp your soup .
marge simpson|college is no place for a young girl with those quadrangles and study carrels and syllabi ...
marge simpson|oh , and this kitchen isn't ?
marge simpson|i put those cathys on the fridge for you .
marge simpson|i don't even like them .
marge simpson|they've gotten so smutty .
marge simpson|homer , cathy is a woman .
marge simpson|in the tree .
marge simpson|oh , i can't wait to see my surprise !
marge simpson|a koi pond !
marge simpson|it's beautiful .
marge simpson|oh you sweet , wonderful manchild .
marge simpson|i finally have a peaceful place to sit and hear my own thoughts .
marge simpson|what does he want now ?
marge simpson|the oven light is out and you never finished filling up the aquarium .
marge simpson|fine .
marge simpson|i'll go talk to her .
marge simpson|homer's family needs him too , and that's that .
marge simpson|well , let me sew that up for you .
marge simpson|darn her socks ?
marge simpson|i say , darn her !
marge simpson|i'll do them and then i'm outta here .
marge simpson|freshen your drinks , ladies ?
marge simpson|i am so sick of doing her dirty work .
marge simpson|she's taking advantage of us , homer .
marge simpson|she's got a set of lungs on her .
marge simpson|oh my gosh , she's dead .
marge simpson|chief wiggum , homer and i are innocent .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|oh dear , now everyone will think homer and i did it .
marge simpson|the real killer is the man with the braces .
marge simpson|go away !
marge simpson|wait , wait !
marge simpson|that's a suggestion , not a threat !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|this is ridiculous .
marge simpson|you've been through my delicates , my silkies , my dainties , and my unmentionables .
marge simpson|oh homer , what are we going to do ?
marge simpson|i can't believe we've been arrested for murder .
marge simpson|but we're innocent !
marge simpson|it was the man with the braces .
marge simpson|we appreciate your coming to comfort us , but we're not catholic .
marge simpson|how can you have such an appetite at a time like this ?
marge simpson|it's hard to get in the mood ...
marge simpson|with all those murderous eyes staring at us ...
marge simpson|homie , i'm sorry .
marge simpson|i can't .
marge simpson|i just keep thinking about everything we're gonna miss .
marge simpson|the kids growing up , grandchildren ...
marge simpson|my love .
marge simpson|you saved my life .
marge simpson|i'll always love you .
marge simpson|it's the man with the braces !
marge simpson|mrs bellamy ?
marge simpson|oh homie , i'm so lucky to be married to such a selfless and loving man .
marge simpson|i'm back here .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|finally , some repression .
marge simpson|no beer !
marge simpson|i don't care what they say .
marge simpson|i won't feel safe in this town until we have better police .
marge simpson|homer , this is all your fault .
marge simpson|if you hadn't plugged in your dancing santa , none of this would have happened .
marge simpson|yes , and she's crying .
marge simpson|oh , forget it .
marge simpson|they couldn't catch a cold with a ...
marge simpson|a , a coldcatching thing .
marge simpson|you said you'd do something , and you followed through on it .
marge simpson|if you like protecting people , you could make that your job .
marge simpson|you know , start a security company .
marge simpson|that commercial is very effective .
marge simpson|well , they're both lovely .
marge simpson|hold your heads up high , kids .
marge simpson|homie , to honor springfield's newest hero , i made you your favorite dinner .
marge simpson|all three courses are dessert .
marge simpson|dessert is three desserts .
marge simpson|huh ?
marge simpson|homie , please .
marge simpson|why don't you just leave town ?
marge simpson|fat tony , how can you do this ?
marge simpson|but you're just perpetuating a negative italianamerican stereotype .
marge simpson|i mean , you could be a pizza man , organ grinder , uh ...
marge simpson|leaning tower maker ...
marge simpson|and ...
marge simpson|did i say pizza man ?
marge simpson|somebody does care !
marge simpson|oh homie , i'm so glad you're alive !
marge simpson|i'm so glad this all worked out .
marge simpson|thanks for saving my husband , chief .
marge simpson|well then , who shot all the gangsters ?
marge simpson|hm .
marge simpson|time to check in on our little sweetie pie .
marge simpson|yeah , probably dreaming about the time she shot mr burns .
marge simpson|but this is your chance to contact your late wife , maude .
marge simpson|maude flanders , we the living beseech you to appear .
marge simpson|i've got a whole list of things for you to do today .
marge simpson|my favorite is number three !
marge simpson|those were for the church breakfast .
marge simpson|what do you think , homer ?
marge simpson|does this make my hips look big ?
marge simpson|aren't you a dear .
marge simpson|homie , you've been such a sweetheart today .
marge simpson|let's go upstairs and ...
marge simpson|kids , your father made us breakfast .
marge simpson|homie , i must say you have the energy of twenty men lately .
marge simpson|aww .
marge simpson|thank you , general .
marge simpson|that's a big relief .
marge simpson|the horde is almost dead !
marge simpson|there's still some writhing and twitching , but that should stop by morning .
marge simpson|one handsome hubby is all i need .
marge simpson|no bellybutton ?
marge simpson|you're a clone !
marge simpson|then the real homer ...
marge simpson|my homie's dead ?
marge simpson|how will i go on ?
marge simpson|oh well .
marge simpson|i very much doubt that , homer .
marge simpson|these are horrible ghouls from the past .
marge simpson|dr hibbert ?
marge simpson|but we heard you'd gone mad .
marge simpson|homer , someone's in trouble !
marge simpson|dr hibbert , this is a topnotch resort .
marge simpson|can you recommend some activities ?
marge simpson|homie , something very creepy is going on here .
marge simpson|i think i'm going to do a little sleuthing .
marge simpson|house of pain .
marge simpson|this must be where you pay the bill .
marge simpson|why am i always so funny when no one's around ?
marge simpson|dear homie , had to buy diapers for maggie .
marge simpson|love , marge .
marge simpson|simpson .
marge simpson|homie , it's five p .
marge simpson|m .
marge simpson|we're having dinner .
marge simpson|it's true .
marge simpson|i couldn't even wake you up for work this morning .
marge simpson|i had to tell mr burns you had violent diarrhea .
marge simpson|but you did have violent diarrhea .
marge simpson|nobody open the hallway closet until i say it's okay .
marge simpson|that explains that .
marge simpson|oh , you big fooler .
marge simpson|pretending not to remember so you could surprise us .
marge simpson|oh , homie ...
marge simpson|so i'm just some babe who sank her claws into you ?
marge simpson|get in .
marge simpson|get in .
marge simpson|a place where you'll never be bothered by your family again .
marge simpson|get out of the car , homer .
marge simpson|rock 'n' roll fantasy camp !
marge simpson|you work a job you don't like so i'm able to be home with the kids .
marge simpson|do you like it ?
marge simpson|that was great , homie .
marge simpson|i'm glad you had fun , but it's time to come home .
marge simpson|i'm so proud of you , homie .
marge simpson|it's like you're kid rock and i'm pamela anderson lee rock .
marge simpson|i'm his groupie !
marge simpson|am i saying that right , groupie ?
marge simpson|why is he performing the duties of a roadie ?
marge simpson|am i saying that right , roadie ?
marge simpson|did they ever find tom petty's toe ?
marge simpson|a year ago you said they were the greatest thing that ever happened to us .
marge simpson|get back , honky cat !
marge simpson|those systems are too expensive .
marge simpson|why don't you turn off the tv and join us for dessert ?
marge simpson|i made a pie .
marge simpson|would you like some ice cream with that ?
marge simpson|kids , look what i got you for your third grade field trip matching fanny packs !
marge simpson|now your fannies match .
marge simpson|stop !
marge simpson|you'll crush your juice boxes !
marge simpson|well , make sure you don't .
marge simpson|and try not to let your brother get under your skin .
marge simpson|hello , principal skinner .
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|my poor babies !
marge simpson|the plastic casing from the tip of bart's shoelace !
marge simpson|a mother knows !
marge simpson|oh my special little guys .
marge simpson|you're okay , you're okay !
marge simpson|dad left the milk out / yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck ...
marge simpson|that's good satire it doesn't hurt anyone .
marge simpson|what do you think , maggie ?
marge simpson|ooo , look .
marge simpson|there's your father .
marge simpson|well , i've read enough articles about flirting to know it when i see it .
marge simpson|ah , homie , are you as attracted to me as you were when we met ?
marge simpson|sometimes i worry you might think about other women .
marge simpson|that doesn't sound very convincing .
marge simpson|manjula , remember when apu cheated on you ?
marge simpson|i'm worried homer might do the same thing .
marge simpson|what would make a husband lose interest like that ?
marge simpson|oh my god , is that me ?
marge simpson|faced with a problem like this , i wonder , what would oprah do ?
marge simpson|now , i need some liposuction just enough to make me attractive to this man .
marge simpson|doctor , before we begin , i have a couple questions .
marge simpson|what if i just do aerobics and ...
marge simpson|that's funny .
marge simpson|hm , i don't feel sucked out .
marge simpson|what on earth have you done ?
marge simpson|my mcguppies became bazongas !
marge simpson|accidentally giving me breast implants is not a simple misunderstanding .
marge simpson|my surgery was botched !
marge simpson|you had no right to make my bosom this ample !
marge simpson|oh i'll come back all right .
marge simpson|and i'll bring my husband to do a little malpractice on you .
marge simpson|oh , sweetie .
marge simpson|/ oh .
marge simpson|don't worry , maggie , i'll have these silly things out in just two days .
marge simpson|till then i'll just try to hide them from the family .
marge simpson|not feeling well .
marge simpson|going to bed .
marge simpson|dinner and breakfast are on the table .
marge simpson|yes !
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|oooo , homie ...
marge simpson|hey , what happened ?
marge simpson|now , don't get too used to these .
marge simpson|that awful doctor said he'd take them out in a couple of days .
marge simpson|they do make my neck look thinner ...
marge simpson|oh , all right , let's do it .
marge simpson|now wait , homer .
marge simpson|thank you , fellas .
marge simpson|keep in mind , they're only temporaries .
marge simpson|homer , how come you never sang a song like that to me before ?
marge simpson|homie , i could use a little more excitement in my life .
marge simpson|maybe i'll just keep these .
marge simpson|don't make a fuss over me , boys .
marge simpson|just pour me a beer in a clean glass .
marge simpson|it's for my back spasms .
marge simpson|if guys didn't keep pinching my tush , i'd never stand up straight .
marge simpson|i'm afraid all that attention is from the wrong kind of people .
marge simpson|kiki , i'm tired of trade show modeling .
marge simpson|my back really hurts .
marge simpson|did you just drug me ?
marge simpson|eightynine percent of americans would rather have a shoehorn than a computer .
marge simpson|i've heard about you vendors !

marge simpson|exactly .
marge simpson|the preteen braves .
marge simpson|this is a perfect opportunity .

marge simpson|in a whole new way .
marge simpson|where did you get that tutu ?
marge simpson|you're like geraldine ferraro , except you won , where she failed miserably .
marge simpson|lisa , you look so successful .
marge simpson|like you're the wife of a businessman .
marge simpson|oh , isn't that sweet ?
marge simpson|even your brother's adding his kudos .
marge simpson|you were ?
marge simpson|principal skinner , can't you just reinstate those programs ?
marge simpson|lisa , what are you doing ?
marge simpson|this is the kind of troublemaking i expect from your brother .
marge simpson|well , couldn't you just hang some colorful crepe paper in the gym ?
marge simpson|those fudruckers !
marge simpson|oh no , they heard me .
marge simpson|which means someone lost it .
marge simpson|you'll have to put up flyers and see if anyone claims it .
marge simpson|that's the last of them .
marge simpson|you did the right thing , bart , and now you can keep the money .
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|someday i'd like to go on a nice vacation .
marge simpson|yeah , but you always wind up kidnapped , or on a chain gang ...
marge simpson|and i don't even want to get into what happened on our honeymoon .
marge simpson|oh , forget it .
marge simpson|bart , don't waste your money on me .
marge simpson|that sounds great but only if your father promises to behave .
marge simpson|tony ...
marge simpson|i mean mr prime minister ...
marge simpson|what should we see first ?
marge simpson|england is so classy .
marge simpson|every cab has its own butler .
marge simpson|you punched out three people on the street .
marge simpson|do you understand any part of what you just said ?
marge simpson|homie , i don't think we'll be able to find the kids from up here .
marge simpson|oh , look at all these classy british plays .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|stop saying macbeth !
marge simpson|homie , you're doing a great job driving on the left .
marge simpson|this is turning out to be our most enjoyable trip ever .
marge simpson|turn , turn , keep turning , keep turning , keep turning , keep turning ...
marge simpson|no , it's too risky !
marge simpson|we'll just wait till the traffic thins out .
marge simpson|turn , turn , keep turning , keep turning , keep turning , keep turning ...
marge simpson|what difference could it make ?
marge simpson|he hit the friggin' queen !
marge simpson|bart , you're not helping .
marge simpson|it's partly my fault .
marge simpson|homer , you couldn't be in more trouble .
marge simpson|they're going to put your head on a pike .
marge simpson|they're practicing with melons .
marge simpson|englishwomen don't pump gas naked !
marge simpson|all this attention !
marge simpson|i feel like a secretary on administrative professionals day !
marge simpson|kitchen carnival ?
marge simpson|i love it !
marge simpson|thank you , homie .
marge simpson|homer , are you spooning that snack ?
marge simpson|homie , it's time you got rid of that thing .

marge simpson|oh , dear lord .
marge simpson|homer , there's no rear on that thing .
marge simpson|now look here , mister .
marge simpson|i forbid you to fight a bear .
marge simpson|you're not going , and that's final .
marge simpson|lisa , i think your father just left !
marge simpson|i've got a bad feeling about this .
marge simpson|let's check the suit closet .
marge simpson|that man and his foolish pride !
marge simpson|we've gotta go follow him .
marge simpson|mr connor , thank you for helping find my husband .
marge simpson|is there any sign of my husband ?
marge simpson|it's homer , don't shoot !
marge simpson|well , i'm proud of you , homie .
marge simpson|you set out to fight an animal and you ended up saving its life .
marge simpson|maggie's locked inside !

marge simpson|we did homer took him .
marge simpson|didn't you ?

marge simpson|stop it !
marge simpson|how about jon stewart ?
marge simpson|he's a son , a lover and a pundit rolled into one sexy package .
marge simpson|my husband's a powermad star .
marge simpson|maybe now we can get that padding that goes under rugs .
marge simpson|i'm proud of you .
marge simpson|come on , homie .
marge simpson|we'll go to the make your own sundae place .
marge simpson|yes .
marge simpson|they're not getting married !

marge simpson|excuse me , can i ask you a favor ?
marge simpson|perfect !
marge simpson|i'll take it .
marge simpson|what a mall !
marge simpson|isn't it kind of dry ?
marge simpson|homer , is there something you're not telling us ?
marge simpson|what's that ?
marge simpson|you wasted our money on something extravagant for yourself !
marge simpson|you just don't get it , do you ?
marge simpson|you can sleep on the couch tonight .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|that last one looked kinda good .
marge simpson|you've made that promise before .
marge simpson|i've dreamed of the day you'd say that !
marge simpson|oh , your thoughtfulness tastes so good .
marge simpson|and tears are the sweetest sauce .
marge simpson|homie , i'm so proud you changed more than i could imagined !
marge simpson|you're even covering your mouth when you burp .
marge simpson|look , maggie .
marge simpson|a show for babies .
marge simpson|well , maggie likes roofi .
marge simpson|and babies only like good things .
marge simpson|ouay owknay , iay asway oungyay unceway ootay .
marge simpson|it's on batteries .
marge simpson|backed up by solar power .
marge simpson|aw , look how happy she is .
marge simpson|it makes her happy .
marge simpson|i got the roofi tickets !
marge simpson|i got them fair and square and i kept my dignity .
marge simpson|not like janey's mom .
marge simpson|whatever .
marge simpson|this concert is oversold .
marge simpson|it's as if a music promoter acted unscrupulously !
marge simpson|they make the blue man group look like mummenschanz , which is still pretty good .
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|the second one wants custard , too .
marge simpson|that's a little repetitive .
marge simpson|oh no , it's raining !
marge simpson|and maggie's diapers are extraabsorbent !
marge simpson|excuse me , everyone .
marge simpson|i'm a mother .
marge simpson|and i'm an american !
marge simpson|i bake apple pies !
marge simpson|and i love baseball !
marge simpson|then how would we ever get to see camelot ?
marge simpson|is that better ?
marge simpson|to me , ralph wiggum is sir lancelot .
marge simpson|ms .
marge simpson|i'll cut to the chase .
marge simpson|her name is lisa .
marge simpson|and i wouldn't trade her for all the sleepin sundays and speed dating in the world .
marge simpson|then wait in the shadows !
marge simpson|then , i guess this means war .
marge simpson|with the most powerful weapon at my disposal a votersponsored initiative .
marge simpson|i've already drawn up the petition .
marge simpson|no , the march primary .
marge simpson|we've got pretzels at home .
marge simpson|attention , everyone .
marge simpson|to overturn these horrible antifamily laws , we've prepared the families come first initiative .
marge simpson|now , the first thing we're gonna need is money .
marge simpson|save our families !
marge simpson|sign our petition !
marge simpson|but i haven't endorsed it yet !
marge simpson|forget it .
marge simpson|i guess no one gives a damn about the american family anymore .
marge simpson|mr burns ?
marge simpson|you care about children ?
marge simpson|that ad makes me look like a criminal .
marge simpson|that wasn't me !
marge simpson|three !
marge simpson|i try my best .
marge simpson|they ridicule me .
marge simpson|they mock everything i cherish .
marge simpson|you're my rock , homie .
marge simpson|awww ...
marge simpson|what are you going to do ?
marge simpson|i always keep one near the bed for you .
marge simpson|i probably should have watched it first .
marge simpson|it says yes on two thirtytwo .
marge simpson|we want no on two thirtytwo , yes on two fortytwo .
marge simpson|and the bumper stickers misspelled on .
marge simpson|they say yes no two fortytwo .
marge simpson|and it's the night before the election and you haven't handed them out !
marge simpson|i need to be alone right now .
marge simpson|i said no !
marge simpson|it's no !
marge simpson|his old bike is fine !
marge simpson|oh , it's very wise .
marge simpson|it's written by a rabbi who surfs !
marge simpson|oh , lisa .
marge simpson|honey , it's okay .
marge simpson|coltrane ?
marge simpson|lisa , i'm glad you're ready to love again .
marge simpson|but a kitty needs a proper name , like whiskers .
marge simpson|or paws scaggs .
marge simpson|you should be glad i did .
marge simpson|your father wanted to call you bartzeena !
marge simpson|it's the only way to talk to bullies .
marge simpson|my job was to keep lisa's hope alive .
marge simpson|but instead , she's really depressed .
marge simpson|business , what business ?
marge simpson|well , i could use a muffin .
marge simpson|esme delacroix !
marge simpson|she wrote to kiss a scoundrel !
marge simpson|marge simpson , longtime reader , firsttime standerupper ...
marge simpson|did you have any special training to become a writer ?
marge simpson|anyone ?
marge simpson|if i write a book , will they tell me when it comes out ?
marge simpson|then i'll do it !
marge simpson|you work at the nuclear plant .
marge simpson|tonight ?
marge simpson|but i was hoping you could watch the kids while i work on my novel .
marge simpson|homer , you left two jobs and bought an ambulance without even a phone call .
marge simpson|i know i got your message .
marge simpson|i'm writing a novel !
marge simpson|thank you !
marge simpson|hmm ...
marge simpson|what should i write about ?
marge simpson|that painting has always sparked my imagination .
marge simpson|that's it .
marge simpson|a novel about whaling that's something you haven't seen before .
marge simpson|thank you ...
marge simpson|scene from mobydick .
marge simpson|chapter one starts and beginnings .
marge simpson|swim , swim , swim , thought the whale , flapping his ...
marge simpson|floppers .
marge simpson|brownie break !
marge simpson|mayor quimby , disco stu , and our fighting men and women overseas .
marge simpson|well , i finished the thank yous , time to go back to the novel .
marge simpson|temperance barrows stared at the sea like a dog stares at a ham ...
marge simpson|ooh , i just finished my first paragraph .
marge simpson|spell check !
marge simpson|perfect !
marge simpson|now , let's see if lightning strikes twice !
marge simpson|for temperance , the days passed on ...
marge simpson|as did seven of her ten children .
marge simpson|oh homie , i've had the most exciting day ...
marge simpson|fine .
marge simpson|right after this revision !
marge simpson|temperance had to face the unhappy truth ...
marge simpson|she had married a brute .
marge simpson|this story is as dark as those new milky way bars .
marge simpson|ooh , that's a good analogy .
marge simpson|i'll work it in somewhere .
marge simpson|but now i need some romance , pronto !
marge simpson|ned , that's so considerate .
marge simpson|boy , when you write you can let your imagination run wild .
marge simpson|temperance was doing the laundry ...
marge simpson|what do you know ?
marge simpson|it is !
marge simpson|i'm finished !
marge simpson|and it's so suggestive .
marge simpson|but like they say , snuggling sells .
marge simpson|now , do i dare push print ?
marge simpson|well , what do you think ?
marge simpson|what do you mean ?
marge simpson|my book is set in whaling times .
marge simpson|well , i guess that part is loosely based on your father .
marge simpson|i suppose i better .
marge simpson|your father's a very private person .
marge simpson|homie , i finished my novel .
marge simpson|it's really important that you read it and tell me what you think .
marge simpson|it's doublespaced .
marge simpson|well ?
marge simpson|did you read the book ?
marge simpson|did you like it ?
marge simpson|oh that's wonderful .
marge simpson|and the characters didn't bother you at all ?
marge simpson|and you're fine with me trying to get it published ?
marge simpson|oh homie !
marge simpson|hello ?
marge simpson|dr marvin monroe ?
marge simpson|i haven't seen you in years .
marge simpson|the harpooned heart ii thunder down under .
marge simpson|chapter one .
marge simpson|temperance barrows stared at the shrimp on the barbie ...
marge simpson|you told me you liked it !
marge simpson|you didn't read it at all !
marge simpson|you lied to me !
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|there is a place called nantucket .
marge simpson|it was only my imagination .
marge simpson|the end .
marge simpson|please homie , don't hurt him !
marge simpson|oh , homie !
marge simpson|you're trying to improve yourself , and it's because of my book .
marge simpson|that's the best review i've gotten .
marge simpson|seriously .
marge simpson|these reviews are terrible .
marge simpson|jack ruby was a man , not a jewel .
marge simpson|there , there , i can help you kids .
marge simpson|i know a little something about history .
marge simpson|gather 'round .
marge simpson|finally , henry's daughter elizabeth became queen .
marge simpson|no problem !
marge simpson|in elementary school , we girls learned about sacagawea while the boys were learning math !
marge simpson|in 1804 , president jefferson ...
marge simpson|sent lewis and clark and some embedded journalists to find the northwest passage .
marge simpson|they paddled up the mississippi from st .
marge simpson|louis ...
marge simpson|come spring , they sought help from the native americans .
marge simpson|and today , lewis' promise has been fulfilled .
marge simpson|no , it's a sacagawea dollar .
marge simpson|you can trade it in at the bank for a real dollar !
marge simpson|eh ?
marge simpson|bart , what famous historical figure do you want to write about ?
marge simpson|c'mon , bart we can make this fun .
marge simpson|history's like an amusement park , except instead of rides , you have dates to memorize .
marge simpson|boring ?
marge simpson|is there anything boring about a badass rocker who lived fast and died young ?
marge simpson|as a young prodigy , this popular musician wowed audiences across eighteenthcentury europe ...
marge simpson|and that's the life of mozart .
marge simpson|thank god he died young .
marge simpson|i've gotta get dinner on the stove .
marge simpson|why are your clothes so dirty ?
marge simpson|and why do you smell like liquor ?
marge simpson|have you been clubbing ?
marge simpson|homie , they're beautiful .
marge simpson|that chevron station has the most romantic bouquets !
marge simpson|i feel a swoon coming on ...
marge simpson|here it is !
marge simpson|well , i'm sure he'll be happy you came .
marge simpson|bart honey , it's a nice day .
marge simpson|why don't you play outside ?
marge simpson|you know , i think your sister could use a little help washing the car .
marge simpson|you'll be like an owl saying milhouse who ?
marge simpson|milhouse who ?
marge simpson|milhouse whooo ?
marge simpson|homie , i'd like to know what you've been doing after work .
marge simpson|i also found this in your drawer .
marge simpson|are these diamondique ?
marge simpson|diamondelle ?
marge simpson|cubic diamondium ?
marge simpson|dioxyribodiamondoid ?
marge simpson|oh , my god !
marge simpson|oh , my god !
marge simpson|we finally have something to put in the wall safe .
marge simpson|hostess twinkies ?
marge simpson|kids ?
marge simpson|go ride bikes for a while , huh .
marge simpson|listen , mr hobo .
marge simpson|you may not have laundry to wash , but i do .
marge simpson|now what do you want to show me ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|you're panhandling !
marge simpson|i should have known from that panhandling sign !
marge simpson|plus that ticket you got for panhandling .
marge simpson|homer , i don't need fancy things .
marge simpson|and even if i did , this is the wrong way to get them .
marge simpson|well , then maybe you need to buy me a brooch .
marge simpson|what's all that racket ?
marge simpson|that's a lot of pressure to put on a baby .
marge simpson|all they should be worried about is the raspberry monster .
marge simpson|maggie !
marge simpson|maggie doesn't talk yet .
marge simpson|oh no no , she says lots of words .
marge simpson|my baby has no future !
marge simpson|grocers don't make that much .
marge simpson|and even then , he could only speak german !
marge simpson|all our children are smart .
marge simpson|some are just smarter than the others .
marge simpson|maggie , i can't believe how much stuff your new school sent over !
marge simpson|look at these courses you'll be taking .
marge simpson|advanced peekaboo .
marge simpson|'got your nose' and other lies ...
marge simpson|look lisa , there's something in here for you !
marge simpson|and maggie gets a shirt , too !
marge simpson|sweetie , you seem so blue .
marge simpson|did the last of something die ?
marge simpson|well , i know who you are .
marge simpson|and here's something to help you never forget !
marge simpson|well , then ...
marge simpson|find a new identity .
marge simpson|lisa !
marge simpson|you were purposely teaching her the wrong word !
marge simpson|lisa , i'm surprised .
marge simpson|your sister just wants to learn and be like you .
marge simpson|well , maybe she needs a better role model .
marge simpson|lisa's gone !
marge simpson|you have to find her !
marge simpson|but she's only eight !
marge simpson|fine .
marge simpson|extremely satisfied .
marge simpson|i hope this typeface catches people's eye .
marge simpson|it sure didn't move our old fondue set !
marge simpson|where'd you find these ?
marge simpson|oh my god , what ?
marge simpson|lisa ...
marge simpson|lisa ...
marge simpson|oh god , we're in a belly .
marge simpson|everyone take off your shoes .
marge simpson|how do we get out ?
marge simpson|lisa !
marge simpson|you're all right !
marge simpson|just tell her which friggin' button to push !
marge simpson|uhhmm .
marge simpson|you took little children to the redeadening ?
marge simpson|homer , this is a rare lapse in judgment for you .
marge simpson|honey , i know you're scared .
marge simpson|but there's no boogie woogies or wooly bullies out there .
marge simpson|oh , your nightlight's burned out .
marge simpson|and the only bulbs we have left are these red ones .
marge simpson|homie , that kojak is sexier than cannon and barnaby jones put together .
marge simpson|i think he looks a little like you .
marge simpson|how about a little interrogation ?
marge simpson|good .
marge simpson|can you play with him for half an hour ?
marge simpson|artie ziff !
marge simpson|no we didn't .
marge simpson|no you didn't .
marge simpson|artie ziff !
marge simpson|why are you living in our attic ?
marge simpson|we had one date .
marge simpson|and you were not a gentleman .
marge simpson|i don't know , artie ...
marge simpson|i thought you were playing catch with artie .
marge simpson|oh my .
marge simpson|well , homer , maybe you should take him to moe's .
marge simpson|i'm not .
marge simpson|my husband's going to jail and it's all your fault !
marge simpson|do you know why no one likes you ?
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|your problem is you never think of anyone besides yourself .
marge simpson|i never want you in this house again !
marge simpson|oh , what do you think ?
marge simpson|okay kids , this book should help you deal with your feelings .
marge simpson|daddy's not on fire .
marge simpson|okay , fine , he is .
marge simpson|i'm so happy to be getting my husband back .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|artie , thank you for doing the right thing .
marge simpson|eventually .
marge simpson|kids , you'd better take your last look at uncle artie .
marge simpson|kids , why don't you write a complaint letter ?
marge simpson|that's how i got the channel six weather girl to start wearing a bra .
marge simpson|well , northern california is wine country we could take a tour .
marge simpson|enjoy your tour , and take it easy on mr curtis .
marge simpson|your father and i will be across the street at the lush valley winery .
marge simpson|we should do more together .
marge simpson|you're my best friend , homie .
marge simpson|the doctor said if you tried running again , your ankles would shatter .
marge simpson|mmm , it goes great with the jolly rancher i'm sucking on !
marge simpson|stop it , seinfeld .
marge simpson|don't tell mama what mama don't like .
marge simpson|come here , you big lug !
marge simpson|homie , to store the extra wine we bought , i made a little wine cellar .
marge simpson|well , i've been using it for laundry soap , but , okay .
marge simpson|homie , you are so cute .
marge simpson|i don't talk like that .
marge simpson|well , you talk like marge , sorry i set the bed on fire .
marge simpson|moe's tavern ?
marge simpson|that's your fun place , like me and the lamp store .
marge simpson|no , it'll have to do .
marge simpson|oh , my head !
marge simpson|do you have to make such an unholy racket ?
marge simpson|maybe we should put this booze cruise in dry dock for a while .
marge simpson|okay ...
marge simpson|and maybe you could cut back too .
marge simpson|i hope i can still have fun while everyone else is drinking .
marge simpson|well , i don't want to be a gloomhilda .
marge simpson|i guess one beer won't hurt .
marge simpson|isn't that a little big ?
marge simpson|have you ever walked on stilts ?
marge simpson|it's not that great .
marge simpson|eh , why do people worry about stuff ?
marge simpson|it's all gonna work out .
marge simpson|are we home yet ?
marge simpson|oh no !
marge simpson|i'm gonna be incarce ...
marge simpson|incarce ...
marge simpson|incarce ...
marge simpson|i'm going to jail .
marge simpson|i can't believe i drove drunk .
marge simpson|i don't know what to believe anymore .
marge simpson|just take me home .
marge simpson|i'm not a drunk !
marge simpson|this is a pamphlet for chimney sweeping .
marge simpson|my drinking problem is out of control .
marge simpson|at oktoberfest , all i could think about was beer !
marge simpson|i couldn't even celebrate ...
marge simpson|the harvest .
marge simpson|look , i'm not sure this place is working .
marge simpson|get away from me !
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|you let me believe that i'd done such a terrible thing ?
marge simpson|i can't believe you did that to me .
marge simpson|i am so cheesed off .
marge simpson|i need a drink !
marge simpson|pour me another .
marge simpson|well , i feel a buzz , but i don't feel happier .
marge simpson|it's not like when i was drinking with homer .
marge simpson|hey , you're right !
marge simpson|what i enjoyed was spending time with my husband .
marge simpson|well , i love my husband and i'm glad i do .
marge simpson|my name is marge s .
marge simpson|and i'm a homerholic !
marge simpson|i'm afraid what i like can't be swallowed , sniffed or smoked .
marge simpson|thanks for everything , kyle .
marge simpson|homie , i want you to promise me you'll cut down on the drinking .
marge simpson|well , that's no promise at all !
marge simpson|it's important for me to see you take at least one step .
marge simpson|then maybe we can have some memories together that aren't just a nauseous blur .
marge simpson|really ?
marge simpson|even zima ?
marge simpson|you really mean it ?
marge simpson|homer , before you get anywhere near the escalator , you've got to tie those shoes .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|he's eating my beauty !
marge simpson|i hope he didn't have children .
marge simpson|did he have children ?
marge simpson|that doesn't look so big .

marge simpson|how about a bite of the world's biggest brussels sprout ?
marge simpson|let's see how your sister's doing in the placesetting competition .
marge simpson|where were you , homie ?
marge simpson|you missed all the excitement .
marge simpson|ooh , i'll bet he's ned flanders .
marge simpson|i'm not being trampled .
marge simpson|what gives ?
marge simpson|listen ...
marge simpson|i'm married .
marge simpson|i'm looking up your nose , but i feel like i'm staring into your soul .
marge simpson|that was so exciting , yet familiar .
marge simpson|like coke with lemon .
marge simpson|oh , me too ...
marge simpson|homie ...
marge simpson|are you the pie man ?
marge simpson|well , whoever he is , the pie man would never cave in to blackmail .
marge simpson|now , on a different subject , kiss me hard .
marge simpson|i don't care .
marge simpson|i know one person who believes you were the pie man , homie ...
marge simpson|me .
marge simpson|i've known it all along .
marge simpson|no , it was clearly you in that suit .
marge simpson|you'd have to be an idiot not to see it from the start .
marge simpson|so ...
marge simpson|pie man , why don't you show me your superpowers ?
marge simpson|pie man ?
marge simpson|stop it , homer !
marge simpson|there's only one way to settle this in simpson family court .
marge simpson|i got the idea from a nowdiscredited book on raising children .
marge simpson|your father's first kiss was in high school with me .
marge simpson|homer , that girl was me !
marge simpson|yes ...
marge simpson|and then your father broke my heart .
marge simpson|and if i'd known he was you , i never would have married you !
marge simpson|you're not gonna be kissing anybody for a while .
marge simpson|i'll start from the beginning .
marge simpson|the girls' camp was focused on teaching etiquette and deportment .
marge simpson|now that i've captured your interest , let me continue ...
marge simpson|i used to walk like this all the time ...
marge simpson|until my tendon snapped .
marge simpson|they heard it in shelbyville !
marge simpson|anyhoo ...
marge simpson|one night we had a special dinner .
marge simpson|we were learning to use all thirtythree forks .
marge simpson|i told my friends i had a date ...
marge simpson|uggams !
marge simpson|it was as satisfying as a million hallmark cards with all the rightsized envelopes .
marge simpson|but then your father showed his true colors .
marge simpson|so we arranged to meet again at second date rock .
marge simpson|it was years before i could trust a boy again .
marge simpson|i guess so .
marge simpson|no , homer .
marge simpson|no , homer .
marge simpson|no , homer .
marge simpson|i guess it didn't mean that much to you .
marge simpson|i wish there was some way i could believe that .
marge simpson|oh , homie !
marge simpson|you did care .
marge simpson|i kept my heart too .
marge simpson|no , as a reminder of the hurtful things men can do .
marge simpson|but now it can have a second meaning .
marge simpson|oh , elvis .
marge simpson|how's the ice cream , kids ?
marge simpson|who's ready for a kitten ?
marge simpson|oh , you children are too suspicious .
marge simpson|it's go time .
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|that hobo skeleton is not a toy !
marge simpson|now , that wasn't so bad , was it bart ?
marge simpson|you know , sometimes the fear of some ...
marge simpson|stop it , homer !
marge simpson|i think you should stay home from school tomorrow .
marge simpson|i swear bart didn't know what he was doing .
marge simpson|he was deaf !
marge simpson|if there's one way to get the truth out , it's on a cable news channel .
marge simpson|when we explain our side of the story , the hate calls will end .
marge simpson|i won't have to hear suck my such and such or hell this and bitch that ...
marge simpson|i'll have you know i am very well liked in springfield .
marge simpson|homeland noodles with uncle sam balls ?
marge simpson|apu , aren't you going a bit overboard with the patriotism ?
marge simpson|uh oh .
marge simpson|poonam and uma are fighting !
marge simpson|i can't believe they put us in jail .
marge simpson|then a three hour plane ride .
marge simpson|you were right , homie .
marge simpson|we shouldn't have rocked the boat .
marge simpson|then none of this would have ever happened .
marge simpson|i don't know why they put the real ones in with the joke ones .
marge simpson|lisa , that's not funny .
marge simpson|you believe in the bill of rights .
marge simpson|homer , we've got to get outta here .
marge simpson|okay , kids show off your pipes ...
marge simpson|wait right here for our encore ...
marge simpson|does everyone remember their swimming lessons ?
marge simpson|there's a ship !
marge simpson|we're saved !
marge simpson|oh , i've always wanted to go to france .
marge simpson|your women don't age like catherine deneuve .
marge simpson|the food is so delicious here .
marge simpson|and these chanel suits are five for a dollar !
marge simpson|i'm using a jacket as a napkin .
marge simpson|and yet , i miss america .
marge simpson|i wish we could go back , but i don't think we're welcome there .
marge simpson|i think i'm going to like this america .
marge simpson|you don't sell roadside corn .
marge simpson|i can't believe that historic rock is gone .
marge simpson|why don't you publish your poem ?
marge simpson|look at you go .
marge simpson|typeity type , type , type !
marge simpson|some anniversary this is .
marge simpson|hello ?
marge simpson|octopuses ?
marge simpson|i'm done .
marge simpson|homer , what are you doing ?
marge simpson|homer , i am so mad at you !
marge simpson|i'll bet you blew up the town just to get out of cleaning the garage !
marge simpson|yeah , well , the joke's on you , smart guy .
marge simpson|the garage made it to heaven too !
marge simpson|that sounds like maggie .
marge simpson|but she's right here ...
marge simpson|marge !
marge simpson|why is my swimsuit so revealing ?
marge simpson|where'd you get that rib ?
marge simpson|bart , what are you doing ?
marge simpson|stop that !
marge simpson|we're guests in mr burns !
marge simpson|oh my sweet , undigested baby !
marge simpson|and white blood cells are attacking my clothes !
marge simpson|although i must admit , they know where to stop .
marge simpson|don't worry .
marge simpson|we'll be fine !
marge simpson|cut me some slack , i'm a widow .
marge simpson|bart , where did you get those ?
marge simpson|simpson .
marge simpson|relax , we're just lookyloos .
marge simpson|we're only here to compare our lifestyle to our neighbors .
marge simpson|it's so beautiful and modern .
marge simpson|ooh , a subzero fridge ...
marge simpson|this is the kitchen i've always wanted .
marge simpson|ooh , a bread makermaker !
marge simpson|homie , when i married you , i knew we wouldn't live in luxury .
marge simpson|but seeing that kitchen today made me wish we had something a little better for ourselves .
marge simpson|oh , homie ...
marge simpson|that's so thoughtful , but maybe we should hire a professional contractor .
marge simpson|maybe you should turn off the power .
marge simpson|don't demolish along the way !
marge simpson|playdude magazines ?
marge simpson|have you been hiding bosom rags from me ?
marge simpson|these magazines are from before we were married .
marge simpson|maybe you should throw them away .
marge simpson|the articles , eh ?
marge simpson|so you wouldn't mind if i cut out all the erotic nudes ?
marge simpson|i'm not wearing any clothes .
marge simpson|so why don't i just splay myself on a pool table !
marge simpson|okay , here's your precious articles .
marge simpson|i think you used too much plaster .
marge simpson|i never stopped telling you .
marge simpson|i'm calling a contractor .
marge simpson|thanks for taking the job .
marge simpson|i'm sorry my husband is being so difficult .
marge simpson|and how 'bout a huzzah for my husband who paid for our new kitchen ?
marge simpson|great stuff , ned .
marge simpson|i guess it would be a hoot to have my face on everything .
marge simpson|bart , can you come in here for a second ?
marge simpson|in the ovenfresh bakeoff , clever presentation is as important as taste .
marge simpson|so i'm entering my dessert dogs !
marge simpson|it's deep fried cookie dough with meringue buns , cherry ketchup and caramel mustard .
marge simpson|i hope the ovenfresh bakeoff likes them as much as you do .
marge simpson|well , open it , open it , open it !
marge simpson|oh my god !
marge simpson|someone , somewhere says i'm better than someone else !
marge simpson|my dessert !
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|it's gonna be weird cooking without your tipsy father grabbing me from behind .
marge simpson|but i think i'm up to it .
marge simpson|why thank you , billy .
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|stuart , i'm making a dessert that looks like a hot dog , but it isn't .
marge simpson|she is not !
marge simpson|fish scales ?
marge simpson|stop !
marge simpson|you're tainting my entry !
marge simpson|you did it on purpose ?
marge simpson|why is everyone at this bakeoff such a meaniebobeanie ?
marge simpson|why can't everyone just play fair and ...
marge simpson|did you just dunk your hair in my mixing bowl ?
marge simpson|you're right .
marge simpson|i stretch your father's meatloaf with sawdust .
marge simpson|i guess i was the last one .
marge simpson|these other dishes look so pretty .
marge simpson|and those cheaters blackened my sugar wieners .
marge simpson|i'd like to give those betty crookeds a taste of their own medicine .
marge simpson|yes ...
marge simpson|medicine .
marge simpson|baby ear medicine .
marge simpson|even the pope couldn't forgive this pizza ...
marge simpson|and he's letting a lot of things slide these days .
marge simpson|don't worry , there's plenty for all of you !
marge simpson|now who's laughing ?
marge simpson|huh ?
marge simpson|huh ?
marge simpson|me !
marge simpson|i'm laughing !

marge simpson|well , it's not my fault !
marge simpson|look , i'll be a winner with feet of clay ...
marge simpson|like mickey mantle .
marge simpson|everyone loves the mick .
marge simpson|can't you understand that i need this ?
marge simpson|she's already ahead of me .
marge simpson|well , i didn't come this far not to cheat .
marge simpson|i look up to you ...
marge simpson|because you let me down .
marge simpson|that's clever ...
marge simpson|and devastating .
marge simpson|stop the competition !
marge simpson|i don't deserve to win .
marge simpson|i sabotaged all the other entries !
marge simpson|thanks , honey , for saving me from myself .
marge simpson|b .
marge simpson|f .

marge simpson|i've had your scrambled eggs , homer .
marge simpson|the secret ingredient is whiskey .
marge simpson|that coulda been me .
marge simpson|homer , the capital of kentucky is frankfort .
marge simpson|yes , it's something , dear .
marge simpson|he sure is if he can keep up with these party animals !
marge simpson|aunt patty , aunt selma , grandma bouvier and grampa !
marge simpson|plus your schoolyard chums martin and ralph !
marge simpson|it's the best i could do on such short notice .
marge simpson|he's got the measles .

marge simpson|she'll save the party !
marge simpson|honey , sit down ...
marge simpson|have a big slice of cake !
marge simpson|lisa , wait ...
marge simpson|it's not just the presents the kids don't appreciate me anymore .
marge simpson|they'd rather hang out with their friends than with their mom .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|no , i've got a lot more mothering left in me !
marge simpson|we can eat fries out of a safari hat !
marge simpson|well , i guess it's just you and me , bart !
marge simpson|they grow up so fast .
marge simpson|oh sure , you love me now , but you'll turn .
marge simpson|aren't you the boy who beats up my son ?
marge simpson|those tadpoles are your lunch ?
marge simpson|here , take this .
marge simpson|my daughter didn't want the lunch i made .
marge simpson|you don't have to impress me by making fun of others .
marge simpson|i already like you .

marge simpson|and uh , where's your dad in all this ?
marge simpson|nelson , how'd you like to earn some extra money around our house ?
marge simpson|i have some odd jobs my kids won't do .
marge simpson|sometimes i think he's more interested in his itchy and mitchy cartoons than me .
marge simpson|that's how we got our kaypro !
marge simpson|now , i know there's a handsome young man behind all that hair and dirt .
marge simpson|well , maybe not .
marge simpson|but you did a great job on the lawn .
marge simpson|lisa , just take a bite .
marge simpson|one bite that's all i ask !
marge simpson|i didn't give your son charity .
marge simpson|i gave him selfrespect .
marge simpson|go home to your son , mrs muntz .
marge simpson|and try not to have intercourse on the way !
marge simpson|nelson , what are you doing out this late ?
marge simpson|she's still your mother .
marge simpson|come inside .
marge simpson|can i get you a glass of milk ?
marge simpson|uhhuh .
marge simpson|bart , have you ever eaten a tootsie pop ?

marge simpson|bart , eat up or you'll be late for school !
marge simpson|nelson , doesn't that hurt your teeth ?
marge simpson|i don't like the sound of that .
marge simpson|tomorrow i'm taking you to doctor shapiro .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|i want to hear what happened at the store !
marge simpson|well , i'm glad everything worked out so well .
marge simpson|perhaps if you wrap it in a slice of cheese .
marge simpson|homer , that was for the dog .
marge simpson|what's that rumble ?
marge simpson|this is the most exciting scandal since the juice was on the loose .
marge simpson|she's from springfield !
marge simpson|i knew her in high school .
marge simpson|chloe sure turned out successful .
marge simpson|chloe , hi !
marge simpson|evergreen terrace .
marge simpson|terrace .
marge simpson|evergreen terrace .
marge simpson|the street that smells like pee .
marge simpson|this is my daughter , lisa .
marge simpson|well , it is good to see you , chloe .
marge simpson|would you like to come over for dinner tomorrow ?
marge simpson|homer .
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|we finally found out why the dog was scooting around on his butt all day .
marge simpson|turns out he had an impacted anal gland .
marge simpson|the excitement never stops .
marge simpson|chloe , would you like to see slides of our trip to athens ...
marge simpson|boulevard recreational center ?
marge simpson|i guess .
marge simpson|homer , why do you always have to show that to company ?
marge simpson|homer , what are you doing ?
marge simpson|did you just swallow another bone ?
marge simpson|that's ridiculous .
marge simpson|no one's bowl smells ...
marge simpson|it's like christmas in aspen .
marge simpson|back then , we were both stars in the thrillaminute world of high school journalism .
marge simpson|when we published the story , we received the school's highest award .
marge simpson|well , we both faced a tough decision ...
marge simpson|go off to journalism school , or stay in springfield with our sweethearts ?
marge simpson|chloe left town as soon as barney proposed .
marge simpson|bart , stop that !
marge simpson|why would homer write his name in grime ?
marge simpson|that's better .
marge simpson|well , i just made the bathroom floor smell like lemons .
marge simpson|where's the award for that ?
marge simpson|chloe has such an amazing life .
marge simpson|i wonder what would have happened if i'd stuck with journalism .
marge simpson|yeah , i guess .
marge simpson|that's a sweet thought , homie .
marge simpson|how dare you show my daughter a life of fun and possibility ?
marge simpson|for your information , our electric dishwasher is on the fritz .
marge simpson|not that you care about the ups and downs of my appliances .
marge simpson|do ya ?
marge simpson|huh , do ya ?
marge simpson|i'm so sick of names !
marge simpson|no one's fighting over you !
marge simpson|shiner be gone .
marge simpson|lisa , let me explain what happened tonight .
marge simpson|sometimes when your mom has half a glass of wine , she goes cuckoo bananas .
marge simpson|let me think about it .
marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|lisa breakfast !
marge simpson|i know you're mad at me , but i hope you're not mad at cap'n crunch ...
marge simpson|homer , we've gotta get lisa !
marge simpson|i don't see lisa in any of the seminars !
marge simpson|homer , look !
marge simpson|she's taken my daughter to an erupting volcano ?
marge simpson|that's it !
marge simpson|she is off the christmas card list .
marge simpson|we've gotta go now !
marge simpson|i'm coming , sweetheart !
marge simpson|i'll save you , lisa !
marge simpson|whoa .
marge simpson|shut up !
marge simpson|nothing's more powerful than a mother's love .
marge simpson|don't worry .
marge simpson|we've got two hours before it burns down to my head .
marge simpson|well , looking at you kids , i know i made the right choice in life .
marge simpson|this is marge simpson , reporting from lake placid where the miracle on ice never happened .
marge simpson|nooooo !
marge simpson|lousy drawer ...
marge simpson|potato masher stuck in small spoon slot ...
marge simpson|what kind of madman would do that ?
marge simpson|oh , bart , honey i'm so sorry .
marge simpson|no harm done .
marge simpson|so she gave you a grownup gift .
marge simpson|bart , someone wrote something cynical on your shirt !
marge simpson|let me wash it off .
marge simpson|well , i like tshirts with a nice joke , like support our troops .
marge simpson|we're big fans , mr gladwell .
marge simpson|what a delightful sprite .
marge simpson|homer , use your inside voice .
marge simpson|homer , i want you to get that gamma radiating what'sit out of my home !
marge simpson|i can't believe mr burns reserved the entire museum just for an office party .
marge simpson|homer , these are people you work with .
marge simpson|show some restraint .
marge simpson|i've got a bad feeling about all of this .
marge simpson|homer , that was apollo twelve !
marge simpson|i just don't see why one little pill should cost thirty dollars !
marge simpson|well , the drug company won't do anything to help us .
marge simpson|stow it , you two !
marge simpson|stop making a scene !
marge simpson|what's going on here ?
marge simpson|homer , those kookoobirds at the bank goofed up and sent us a mortgage statement .

marge simpson|this is a new loan tracking number you got a new mortgage ?
marge simpson|you gave the money to moe ?
marge simpson|how's he gonna pay us back ?

marge simpson|i would like it .
marge simpson|you never come to my mother's .
marge simpson|until you pay us back , you're answering to me !
marge simpson|and there's gonna be big changes .
marge simpson|i'm here protecting our investment .
marge simpson|i'd like you to go home and make dinner for the kids .
marge simpson|quit playing dumb .
marge simpson|come on , go home .
marge simpson|maybe some cheerier paint would make this place less of a dive .
marge simpson|well ...
marge simpson|i had a feeling you'd say that .
marge simpson|so i prepared something that might help you change your tune .
marge simpson|thanks , moe .
marge simpson|boy , what a night !
marge simpson|moe showed me how to give someone the bum's rush .
marge simpson|here , watch .
marge simpson|get lost , rummy !
marge simpson|i know , i used to think of moe as a scabby , deadeyed hunchback .
marge simpson|but now that i've gotten to know him , we kind of bonded .
marge simpson|homer , moe and i are just work friends .
marge simpson|you and i are ...
marge simpson|marriage friends .

marge simpson|why don't you sit next to us ?
marge simpson|homer , can you hold my wedding ring for a second ?
marge simpson|my finger's itchy .

marge simpson|how'd you get in here ?
marge simpson|he's right .
marge simpson|moe !

marge simpson|you're my homiewomieromiedomie ...
marge simpson|moe , i need to tell you something .
marge simpson|you showed me you could be a really sweet guy .
marge simpson|you can make a woman very happy some day .
marge simpson|it's true .
marge simpson|you'd be quite a catch ...
marge simpson|if you'd just shower and shave and stop swearing under your breath .
marge simpson|really ?

marge simpson|goodnight , both of you .
marge simpson|who's watching the kids ?
marge simpson|i agree .

marge simpson|looselaced gym shoes ?
marge simpson|are you going to a rap performance ?

marge simpson|that little sneak disobeyed us and went to that hiphop festival !

marge simpson|excuse me , reverend .
marge simpson|which book ?
marge simpson|but reverend ...
marge simpson|scriptural scholars disagree on the significance for christians of many of the old testament's proscriptions .
marge simpson|jesus' teachings stressed inclusiveness and compassion ...
marge simpson|homer , you married every gay couple in town .
marge simpson|don't you push them !
marge simpson|they've gotta work that out for themselves .
marge simpson|straight .

marge simpson|no .
marge simpson|i'm just ...
marge simpson|surprised .
marge simpson|so patty .
marge simpson|you're a woman who likes women .
marge simpson|i guess that fear i always had of you stealing homer away is unfounded .
marge simpson|well , i guess i could have seen the signs .
marge simpson|oh no .
marge simpson|oh no .
marge simpson|why would it be ?
marge simpson|right ?
marge simpson|because she's bringing over someone very special .
marge simpson|her fiancée .
marge simpson|actually your aunt is marrying a very lucky ...
marge simpson|woman .
marge simpson|so veronica , what do you do ?
marge simpson|no surprises there .
marge simpson|whoa !
marge simpson|save something for your wedding night .
marge simpson|i don't think it's exactly what mom would want .
marge simpson|of course .
marge simpson|everyone should do whatever they want .
marge simpson|take a bear to church !
marge simpson|read a book with your feet !
marge simpson|change your name to goobleglop !
marge simpson|the toilet seat's up !
marge simpson|but that wouldn't happen unless ...
marge simpson|she's a man !
marge simpson|looks like patty's gonna get something she didn't register for .
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|i can't let this happen !
marge simpson|patty , it's not what you think .
marge simpson|veronica is a man !
marge simpson|well , i've learned a lesson .
marge simpson|just because you're a lesbian , it doesn't make you less of a bein' .
marge simpson|grampa , you're a greet grater !
marge simpson|i mean a great greeter !
marge simpson|now look who's senile !
marge simpson|i'll take a cart .
marge simpson|lisa , you took out a restraining order against your own brother ?
marge simpson|i always hoped we wouldn't be one of those restraining order families .
marge simpson|please lift this restraining order , judge harm .
marge simpson|it's poking our family apart .
marge simpson|bart , lisa went over to janey's .
marge simpson|quick , run inside and go potty !
marge simpson|lisa , don't you think your brother's suffered enough ?
marge simpson|he's done good things for you too .
marge simpson|he brought home your homework when you were sick .
marge simpson|well , let's count that anyway .
marge simpson|it's a natural process that women of a certain age go through .
marge simpson|selma , i never realized you wanted a child so badly .
marge simpson|don't cry , sweetie .
marge simpson|everything's gonna be all right .
marge simpson|wait till the drambuie and sleeping pills kick in .
marge simpson|go , go , go !
marge simpson|homer , if you do this one small favor , it could transform selma's life .

marge simpson|mind your manners , lisa .
marge simpson|selma , she's beautiful !

marge simpson|hey , hey , it's krusty the clown !
marge simpson|what do you say , krusty ?
marge simpson|always nice to see him .
marge simpson|he's cleaning out the garage .
marge simpson|i can picture it now ...
marge simpson|homie !
marge simpson|oh , thank god !
marge simpson|he's alive !
marge simpson|honey ...
marge simpson|your nearfatal boo boo today really scared me .
marge simpson|what would the kids and i do if something happened to you ?
marge simpson|you keep almost dying .
marge simpson|just look at our vacation photos .
marge simpson|homie , if you die , i'm gonna have three kids to take care of .
marge simpson|i want you to buy some life insurance .
marge simpson|please ?
marge simpson|you don't smoke !
marge simpson|i'm not gonna worry just because homer doesn't have insurance .
marge simpson|a lot of people don't !
marge simpson|oh , this is only based on a story .
marge simpson|a true story !
marge simpson|we need to start saving !
marge simpson|go easy on that it's gotta last 'til you're five .
marge simpson|that's right .
marge simpson|it's much less expensive than the leading clownbased cereal .
marge simpson|you just have to assemble it yourself .
marge simpson|we saved fifty cents on that purchase !
marge simpson|oh , we're just saving for ...
marge simpson|a very rainy day .
marge simpson|well , i just think we should be building a nest egg .
marge simpson|i have a book from the library with the same information !
marge simpson|no more directory assistance !
marge simpson|it's not free !
marge simpson|no more oriental mustard !
marge simpson|can you help me unload this soup from the car ?
marge simpson|there was a sale , so i bought four hundred cans .
marge simpson|oh honey , i know it's not easy , but we've got to put money away .
marge simpson|don't you think you've had enough fun ?
marge simpson|oh please .
marge simpson|you shouted it while we were making love !
marge simpson|now look here , mister .
marge simpson|my scrimpings !
marge simpson|did you spend our savings on a motor home ?
marge simpson|well i hope you enjoy it , your majesty 'cause i'm not speaking to you !
marge simpson|kids , come back in the house !
marge simpson|i melted string cheese over some corn chips !
marge simpson|i'll let you sass me !
marge simpson|you can wear swimsuits instead of underwear !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|what are all these recreational vehicles doing here ?
marge simpson|this is a house !
marge simpson|i know another place you can go to sleep !
marge simpson|can't turn off the power , eh ?
marge simpson|lights out , weirdoes !
marge simpson|you don't belong on the lawn .
marge simpson|you belong in your bed with your wife !
marge simpson|well , you're not perfect either !
marge simpson|you hide food in my hair ...
marge simpson|you think brushing your teeth is foreplay ...
marge simpson|i'll have you know i could have married sideshow mel !
marge simpson|and i'm so sick of that story about finding an onion ring in your french fries .
marge simpson|it was twenty years ago !
marge simpson|captain , wait !
marge simpson|i have something here that might change your mind !
marge simpson|you don't take anything seriously .
marge simpson|not even your bankruptcy hearing !
marge simpson|we've got to stop them .
marge simpson|oh my god , there they are !
marge simpson|oh , i've lost them !
marge simpson|i can't see past all the suvs !

marge simpson|three hundred cans of budget club mushroom soup !
marge simpson|well , if he thinks he's getting a corner piece , forget it .
marge simpson|hey , it's only money .
marge simpson|and it did make a cool splash .
marge simpson|which came first , turkey the bird or turkey the you guys ?
marge simpson|if you don't want to say it , just think it .
marge simpson|you know , we should visit shelbyville more often .
marge simpson|they have a store that just sells shoes .
marge simpson|i feel like i'm in paris !
marge simpson|let's see .
marge simpson|there's equus starring sideshow mel ...
marge simpson|the three dollar bills in 'gay , gay , gay !
marge simpson|' ...
marge simpson|ooh , song of shelbyville !
marge simpson|this is the worst crisis the springfield cultural activities board has ever faced .
marge simpson|those shelbyvillians are maligning us all .
marge simpson|i've never heard such meanspirited hatehoots .
marge simpson|why do you come to these meetings ?
marge simpson|there must be something else .
marge simpson|think marge , think .
marge simpson|culture ...
marge simpson|vulture ...
marge simpson|birds of prey ...
marge simpson|pray in a church ...
marge simpson|the father , son and holy ghost ...
marge simpson|ghosts are scary , scary rhymes with gehry !
marge simpson|that's it architect frank gehry !
marge simpson|he could build us a concert hall like he did in los angeles .
marge simpson|then it's agreed !
marge simpson|we ask frank gehry to build us a concert hall !
marge simpson|dear mr gehry would you please build a concert hall for our town ?
marge simpson|i wrote that letter .
marge simpson|well , aren't you ?
marge simpson|i'm so excited .
marge simpson|it's like giving birth to a child of steel and iron .
marge simpson|don't leave now !
marge simpson|the next piece is an atonal medley by philip glass !
marge simpson|he's turned it into a prison !
marge simpson|ooh , a tiffany's box !
marge simpson|and the thing inside is from tiffany's !
marge simpson|homie , you've never done this before .
marge simpson|how'd you afford it ?
marge simpson|haven't you seen what happens to people who rat in prison movies ?
marge simpson|the prison snitch is killed !
marge simpson|and that could be you !
marge simpson|because you're the prison snitch !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homer , where are you ?
marge simpson|as president of the cultural board i was given a key to the concert hall .
marge simpson|oh , you must be michael's dad !
marge simpson|oh , homie ...
marge simpson|governor , i think the only fair solution is to pardon all these thugs and murderers .
marge simpson|kids , come down for your prom photo !
marge simpson|oooh .
marge simpson|smile !
marge simpson|oh it's so great .

marge simpson|lisa , graduating two years early , and bart ...
marge simpson|graduating .
marge simpson|homer , we're separated now .
marge simpson|you can't just walk in without knocking .
marge simpson|homer , just settle down .
marge simpson|we just got a postcard from maggie .
marge simpson|she's really enjoying alaska .
marge simpson|lisa , your date's here !
marge simpson|when i was a kid we didn't show our affection by headbutting .
marge simpson|oh , i am so glad you think so .
marge simpson|kids ...
marge simpson|i want you to know i've started seeing someone .
marge simpson|he's from springfield , i think you know him ...
marge simpson|the one what ?
marge simpson|you mean get beaten up by him ?
marge simpson|and i'll admit , it is kinda romantic under the sea .
marge simpson|homer , do something about this leak !
marge simpson|that teddy bear survived three safety recalls , but it couldn't survive you !
marge simpson|it's raining inside !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|i woke up to find an owl eating a mouse on the pillow next to me .
marge simpson|it means you have to fix the roof !
marge simpson|knockers on route 98 .
marge simpson|i'm psychic .
marge simpson|look , i don't know if i want a roofer who hangs out in bars .
marge simpson|well , he better highfive our roof !
marge simpson|come on , kids !
marge simpson|we're gonna visit grampa .
marge simpson|then we're gonna take the dog to the vet ...
marge simpson|then take bart to get circumcised .
marge simpson|i'll tell you what it means when it's over .
marge simpson|oh , he must smell leftovers .
marge simpson|well , he does seem happy here ...
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|you're drooling on my goodwill pile !
marge simpson|and why is the hole in the roof even bigger ?
marge simpson|it's after six he's not coming back .
marge simpson|he's a lousy roofer and a flake !
marge simpson|i don't want to hear any more about ray .
marge simpson|tomorrow morning you buy some shingles and fix that roof yourself .
marge simpson|you're not married to ray !
marge simpson|he's become one of them !
marge simpson|hey boy , want a treat ?
marge simpson|we better get you home .
marge simpson|come on , lisa .
marge simpson|geez louise ...
marge simpson|how you feeling , sweetie ?
marge simpson|what are you doing ?
marge simpson|why aren't you fixing the roof ?
marge simpson|i'm so sick of hearing about that stupid , unreliable ray !
marge simpson|who , by the way , i've never even met !
marge simpson|homer , how did you think i'd feel when i saw that ?
marge simpson|homer , come down for dinner .
marge simpson|ray's not coming !
marge simpson|homer , i know where ray is .
marge simpson|sweetheart , your friend ray is in your head .
marge simpson|you have to understand ray doesn't exist .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|homer , no one has ever seen ray but you .
marge simpson|i called that bosom bar .
marge simpson|the bartender said you were there alone .
marge simpson|electroshock ?
marge simpson|i see ray too .
marge simpson|when did i agree to that ?
marge simpson|you didn't validate my parking .
marge simpson|wait , there's still one last thing that doesn't make sense .
marge simpson|why did you start fixing our roof and then just disappear ?
marge simpson|that's right you're all crooks !
marge simpson|bart , i spent all afternoon stuffing tuna fish into that steak .
marge simpson|have some .
marge simpson|oh , so i've been replaced by a machine ?
marge simpson|oh , fine .
marge simpson|his liver looks healthy .
marge simpson|doctor , you're a pediatrician !

marge simpson|he gave me a list of heartsmart foods .
marge simpson|cottage cheese !
marge simpson|aw honey , please take this seriously .
marge simpson|now you've got nothing !
marge simpson|nothing !
marge simpson|for me , please try a healthy vegetable .
marge simpson|okay , now we know you're allergic to cauliflower .
marge simpson|but i made a special platter of vegetables that are good for you .
marge simpson|it's graffiti you can eatie !
marge simpson|they're not kidnappers !
marge simpson|they're professionally trained childsnatchers , who are taking you to a maximumsecurity fat camp .
marge simpson|fortyseven ?
marge simpson|don't you mean tough love ?
marge simpson|jimminy kimmel !
marge simpson|look how much they're charging for bart's treatment !
marge simpson|i already use crayons for lipstick , and fireplace soot for eyeliner .
marge simpson|homer , maybe you could ask mr burns for a raise .
marge simpson|bart , what are you doing here ?
marge simpson|but ...
marge simpson|you're still fat !
marge simpson|to give these germans das boot ?
marge simpson|jawohl !
marge simpson|no you didn't .
marge simpson|i was hoping we'd miss the three o'clock holdup .
marge simpson|i don't know what to do for dinner now .
marge simpson|vegetables , you've been promoted from side dish to entrée .
marge simpson|bart , don't use that word ...
marge simpson|oh crap .
marge simpson|don't worry about the competition , sweetie .
marge simpson|after all , he works for us .
marge simpson|our prayers pay his salary .
marge simpson|lisa , that sounds like a fancier version of the song you're going to sing !
marge simpson|but your song said you liked springfield .
marge simpson|sweetie , tonight you were perfect ...
marge simpson|homie , i'm worried you're turning into some kind of super kookoo stage mother .
marge simpson|bart , you wanna go to the video arcade ?
marge simpson|actually , i think your father's still upset about the way things went down .
marge simpson|hey , kids !
marge simpson|i scream , you scream , we all scream for ...
marge simpson|haircuts !
marge simpson|you have ?
marge simpson|that's so nice !
marge simpson|a kids' barbershop ?
marge simpson|but they don't have my templates .
marge simpson|oh .
marge simpson|i see .
marge simpson|well , good luck getting to your precious mall barber , 'cause i'm not driving you .
marge simpson|i guess i'll just cut my own hair .
marge simpson|sweetie , don't worry .
marge simpson|god wouldn't spring the rapture on us unannounced .
marge simpson|ooh , i could be the rachel to your jacob .
marge simpson|here's a pretty little wig for lisa , and a handsome toupee for bart !
marge simpson|so , you still think i'm crazy for saving all your hair trimmings ?
marge simpson|okay then .
marge simpson|let's get the rest of this hair back in the freezer .
marge simpson|homer , you didn't touch your second dinner tonight .
marge simpson|and you're reading books !
marge simpson|word books !
marge simpson|what's going on ?
marge simpson|may eighteenth ?
marge simpson|that's one week from today !
marge simpson|homer , i'm glad you're getting exercise , i just wish it wasn't crazy exercise .
marge simpson|the stars are falling to the earth !
marge simpson|just as you predicted .
marge simpson|lisa's going !
marge simpson|we're all going !
marge simpson|i'm so proud of you , homie !
marge simpson|homie ...
marge simpson|i'd better start dinner .
marge simpson|we're not going anywhere , except to bed !
marge simpson|you couldn't predict six o'clock at five thirty !
marge simpson|now good night !
marge simpson|the worst part is i'll never see my homie again !
marge simpson|the warren harding throughhole never seemed so long .
marge simpson|but we don't have a sitter for maggie .
marge simpson|a tv shark is not a babysitter !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|honey , you can be anything you want to be .
marge simpson|what language is this ?
marge simpson|gibbygabby ?
marge simpson|bart , don't make fun of grad students they just made a terrible life choice .
marge simpson|ned , let me give you a little something for babysitting .
marge simpson|you've got a big house , ned .
marge simpson|if you need extra money , why don't you rent out a room ?
marge simpson|what are you two doing ?
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|turn away from that screen and look out the window !
marge simpson|it's happening in ned's house !
marge simpson|why would he allow that ?
marge simpson|c'mon .
marge simpson|you tell him right now .
marge simpson|ned , homer has something to tell you .
marge simpson|you know what i mean .
marge simpson|well , homer , you've driven away the best neighbor a family could ever want .
marge simpson|that's coming from next door !
marge simpson|bart , get your things .
marge simpson|you're leaving with me !
marge simpson|bart , i love you .
marge simpson|but sometimes i don't love your choices .
marge simpson|now we have to find another school for you .
marge simpson|bart , this could be a good new school ...
marge simpson|oakwood academy !
marge simpson|huh ?
marge simpson|think of the leg up you'd have !
marge simpson|what if there's a fire ?
marge simpson|how 'bout this one st .
marge simpson|jerome's catholic school ?
marge simpson|with all the sitting and standing and kneeling , it's like simon says without a winner !
marge simpson|don't you touch bead one !
marge simpson|homer , maybe we should be concerned .
marge simpson|catholics can be a peculiar bunch no birth control , no meat on friday ...
marge simpson|let's just change the subject .
marge simpson|bart , would you like to say grace ?
marge simpson|homer , you've been out all night !
marge simpson|and you look like you've accepted someone as your personal something .
marge simpson|were you at that catholic church ?
marge simpson|i knew they'd try to convert you !
marge simpson|that's what they do !
marge simpson|well i'm not having another twelve kids .
marge simpson|forget it !
marge simpson|and you know , i went to a catholic wedding once .
marge simpson|the incense ruined my pantsuit !
marge simpson|well , homer and bart are well , they're under the weather .
marge simpson|all right !
marge simpson|i admit it they're both at the catholic church !
marge simpson|reverend , what should i do ?
marge simpson|i guess it's good that they're taking an interest in spirituality .
marge simpson|where's homer and bart ?
marge simpson|i wish my family was with me .
marge simpson|well then , i'd like to speak with jesus .
marge simpson|noooo !
marge simpson|first communion ?
marge simpson|but i didn't change bart's diapers for five years to see him become a catholic .
marge simpson|let's go !
marge simpson|they weren't following us .
marge simpson|i just don't think your father's the right person to pick out a religion for you .
marge simpson|hello , homer .
marge simpson|it wasn't a fair fight !
marge simpson|well , i'm gonna show bart that protestants can be hip too .
marge simpson|how do you like those croutons ?
marge simpson|what's wrong , bart ?
marge simpson|you love youth culture !
marge simpson|oh bart , i knew one of these dumb things would work !
marge simpson|my hive !
marge simpson|my trademark hive !
marge simpson|why would we want to go to santa's village ?
marge simpson|it's august .
marge simpson|and i'd also like to know why your hand is in that cast .
marge simpson|frosty !
marge simpson|where's your magic top hat ?
marge simpson|my christmas present to myself this year was leaving that place early .
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|is this a snuggle film ?
marge simpson|how could you allow this , in the room where we ...
marge simpson|do puzzles ?
marge simpson|all right .
marge simpson|away from you .
marge simpson|i don't know .
marge simpson|you are .
marge simpson|bye bart !
marge simpson|i love you , lisa !
marge simpson|sleep tight , maggie !
marge simpson|today's the last day you can eat the yogurt in the fridge !
marge simpson|can he swim ?
marge simpson|i guess i'd better tell them i'm coming home .
marge simpson|i'm at a rest stop south of springfield .
marge simpson|i know , you're sorry now .
marge simpson|i love you too ...
marge simpson|hold on , i'll be off in a minute .
marge simpson|listen , buster .
marge simpson|i had to buy a club soda i didn't want to get change for this phone !
marge simpson|an oogliboogli !
marge simpson|i'll call you back !
marge simpson|well what if by harming a manatee you could save two manatees ?
marge simpson|but before you answer , consider this the manatee you'd have to harm is pregnant .
marge simpson|i think the worst part was when i realized that homer lied to me .
marge simpson|exactly !
marge simpson|maybe you could just put a hat on him and say it's a trick .
marge simpson|huh .
marge simpson|and treated like i deserve .
marge simpson|okay , water monsters .
marge simpson|be friendly .
marge simpson|but not too friendly .
marge simpson|what do i do ?
marge simpson|okay .
marge simpson|uh ...
marge simpson|you know , up close you're kinda cute .
marge simpson|aw , you're a good thing .
marge simpson|i know it .
marge simpson|let me clean out your ears .
marge simpson|i've bonded with him !
marge simpson|where is he taking me ?
marge simpson|i've got my groove back !
marge simpson|i can't believe how many manatees we saved today .
marge simpson|homer ?
marge simpson|ooo .
marge simpson|homie , i accept your apology .
marge simpson|but i'm not coming back yet .
marge simpson|i've found a place where i'm needed .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , homie .
marge simpson|i just can't find it in my heart to come back right now .
marge simpson|oh , my sweet , sweet homie !
marge simpson|you sacrificed yourself for the manatees .
marge simpson|i'm gonna take you home and fix you up , 'cause you're the real endangered species ...
marge simpson|a devoted husband .
marge simpson|and i always will .
marge simpson|don't you have to be back at work ?
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|do something about the noise !
marge simpson|well , they just can't start building in our neighborhood without asking us .
marge simpson|what ever happened to please and thank you ?
marge simpson|we have to stop all this construction .
marge simpson|the noise is jiggling my grapes to the bottom of the jello .
marge simpson|instead of a stamp museum we'll be next door to a graveyard ?
marge simpson|this is a little too spooky for me .
marge simpson|i don't even like watching the count on sesame street .
marge simpson|go back to your own country !
marge simpson|oh sure you can , sweetie .
marge simpson|just don't make a habit of it .
marge simpson|so that's why i've been smelling margaritas at three a .
marge simpson|m .
marge simpson|lisa , honey .
marge simpson|i know last night was tough , but all our kids sleep by themselves .
marge simpson|we don't even hear maggie cry at night anymore !
marge simpson|oh , wait a minute .
marge simpson|there's no batteries in this thing .
marge simpson|tonight i want you to really try to sleep in your own bed , because ...
marge simpson|homer , stop that !
marge simpson|noooo !
marge simpson|homer , can you help me out here ?
marge simpson|isn't this lenny's house ?
marge simpson|lisa , do you really want to watch this ?
marge simpson|what a lousy party .
marge simpson|i don't care what apu was in a past life .
marge simpson|in this life , he's a blabbermouth !
marge simpson|look who's sleeping in our bed again .
marge simpson|homer , we're not really playing .
marge simpson|what if we show lisa we can sleep in her room without being frightened ?
marge simpson|hm ?
marge simpson|lisa , honey .
marge simpson|any chance you can stop reading soon ?
marge simpson|we need professional help .
marge simpson|frankly , no .
marge simpson|lisa kind of took care of herself .
marge simpson|our oldest , bart , was such a handful .
marge simpson|homer , stop that !
marge simpson|four thousand dollars ?
marge simpson|don't worry , we're not evil spirits .
marge simpson|the cemetery ?
marge simpson|and you're just sitting here ?
marge simpson|you're watching cartoons !
marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|sweetie , we're gonna get you home and straighten out all these fears you have .
marge simpson|maggie !
marge simpson|that's not what you do with a hymnal .
marge simpson|homer !

marge simpson|the best thing that ever happened to me was forgetting about you !
marge simpson|i'm sorry you have to leave .

marge simpson|i think he's a male gay .
marge simpson|me too .
marge simpson|i can't believe anyone ever really finds anyone at these things .
marge simpson|i really know where you're coming from .
marge simpson|i guess we have to move on .
marge simpson|i'd love to .
marge simpson|you really mean that ?
marge simpson|i've got amnesia and i have three kids .
marge simpson|mr simpson ?
marge simpson|and that means a lot to a woman .
marge simpson|homer .

marge simpson|i've got some candy in my purse ...
marge simpson|what's wrong , sweetie ?
marge simpson|well , i think it's good to give both ideas a fair hearing .
marge simpson|maybe they could learn from each other .
marge simpson|lisa , lots of times two incompatible things can both be true .
marge simpson|my son's a brat but he's a special little guy .
marge simpson|your father says he's at work , but there he is jumping on a trampoline .
marge simpson|well then i choose ...
marge simpson|uh ...
marge simpson|well , i might as well see what all the fuss is about .
marge simpson|homer , please .
marge simpson|wow , darwin's argument is incredibly persuasive .
marge simpson|and his ship was the beagle , which reminds me of snoopy ...
marge simpson|my favorite peanut !
marge simpson|lisa , i think i have a way to help you at the trial today .
marge simpson|honey , i appreciate the thought , but just leave everything to me .
marge simpson|don't worry lisa , i've got the answer to your problems right here .
marge simpson|look , homie , i brought you a beer .

marge simpson|this house is spectacular .
marge simpson|you must have had a great view of the riots !
marge simpson|okay ...

marge simpson|i always say that .
marge simpson|that's it !
marge simpson|we're outta here .
marge simpson|listen , bub .
marge simpson|we are out of the marriage counseling business .
marge simpson|and the only one you should be giving chicken grease neck rubs to is me .
marge simpson|but not me , 'cause i think they're disgusting .
marge simpson|then i guess you'll do it without me .
marge simpson|crossed arms mean no .
marge simpson|tabitha , what a coincidence i was just thinking sad thoughts about you !
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|no !
marge simpson|what ?
marge simpson|don't give up on buck .
marge simpson|there must be something about him that attracted you in the first place .
marge simpson|let's go .
marge simpson|leave him alone !
marge simpson|all he did was try to help a young couple find their way .
marge simpson|does he really deserve to get strung up for that ?
marge simpson|cut that out !
marge simpson|weren't you just tied up in the blimp ?
marge simpson|marriage is hard work .
marge simpson|but it's worth it when you've got someone wonderful like i do .

marge simpson|homer , our house is on fire !
marge simpson|help me save the children !
marge simpson|homer , where did you get that truck ?
marge simpson|homer , helen lovejoy never returned my casserole dish from the church potluck .

marge simpson|see , lisa .
marge simpson|we're making progress .
marge simpson|i'm very happy for you , bart .
marge simpson|if we can't find a home for those animals , they'll be put to sleep .
marge simpson|your sister's very upset .
marge simpson|honey , what you're feeling is called empathy .

marge simpson|homer !
marge simpson|you won't eat my stuffed peppers , but you'll eat our son ?

marge simpson|our son joined the army !
marge simpson|now listen , bub .
marge simpson|you go down to those recruiters and tell them bart is too young for the army .
marge simpson|i don't want this to be the only memory i have of him .
marge simpson|i think she just answers their phone ...
marge simpson|homie , don't do this you have a wife and three young children at home .
marge simpson|so they're not shipping you overseas ?
marge simpson|i'd give anything to hear homer's voice .
marge simpson|it's not giant and it's not in the distance !
marge simpson|it's small and it's in our room !
marge simpson|don't worry .
marge simpson|i have a secret weapon one more powerful than any gun .
marge simpson|a phone tree .

marge simpson|hey , parents are allowed to keep some secrets .
marge simpson|there is a part of our past that we haven't told you kids about .

marge simpson|anyway , i was growing to admire my professor more and more ...
marge simpson|homer's perfect for me !
marge simpson|just look at this note i miss you .
marge simpson|aww ...
marge simpson|whatever , homer and i had the wrenching task of dividing up a shared life ...
marge simpson|unfortunately , as i later learned , that wasn't heroin .
marge simpson|it was insulin .
marge simpson|homer really did need those injections .
marge simpson|homer , stop !
marge simpson|you don't have to tell the kids everything !
marge simpson|well that professor did teach me one good lesson homie is where my heart is .

marge simpson|a ballet academy here in springfield ?
marge simpson|move over , europe !
marge simpson|lisa , have i ever shown you my shattered dreams box ?
marge simpson|it's upstairs in my disappointment closet .

marge simpson|i'm completely fulfilled , both as a mother and a fan of youth ballet !
marge simpson|now what did you want to say to me ?

marge simpson|look at me , i'm glowing !
marge simpson|homie , lisa's dancing has made me really , really , happy .
marge simpson|who was that ?
marge simpson|and i realize it's wrong to try to live your career dreams through your children .

marge simpson|she's been burned by the most important man in her life ...
marge simpson|her father .
marge simpson|lurleen lumpkin has a hole in her heart , and i'm gonna fill it .

marge simpson|there's only one person in the world who can tell you what to do .
marge simpson|and that person is right here !
marge simpson|no , no , that's just our old christmas decorations .

marge simpson|it's time for you to take control of your own destiny .
marge simpson|you're not a doormat , you're a door prize !
marge simpson|well , you're very welcome , lurleen .
marge simpson|of all the women who've hit on homer over the years , you're my favorite .
marge simpson|if you ever come near homer again , i'll strangle you with your own hair extensions .
marge simpson|that's right , i know .
marge simpson|every week we have to buy something else to save that transforming clown that morphs !
marge simpson|i want you to watch a show that isn't just one long commercial !
marge simpson|you two have been bombarded with enough commercial images !
marge simpson|lisa , i've got a big bunch of black bananas .
marge simpson|you know what that means ...
marge simpson|and bart , you go with your father to shelbyville to get the beanbag chairs rebeaned .
marge simpson|honey ...
marge simpson|we'd love to , but ...
marge simpson|a prizewinning bull is thousands of dollars .
marge simpson|we're putting a stop to this right now !
marge simpson|all right , i've got an idea but it'll take a lot of sewing .
marge simpson|stop the wedding !
marge simpson|bart is a tenyearold boy .
marge simpson|he still sits in the driveway and pretends to drive the car .
marge simpson|i'm sorry , bart .
marge simpson|but sometimes your mom knows best .
marge simpson|sweetie , don't you think your mom might have a trick up her sleeve ?

marge simpson|although it was suspiciously prolawnmower .
marge simpson|homie , she's not making a snuggle film .
marge simpson|ooo , regularsville .
marge simpson|sounds like my kind of place !
marge simpson|ooo , candyland .
marge simpson|a great family game is now a great family movie !

marge simpson|remember , he brought his girlfriend and they got in a fight .
marge simpson|hmm , it smells like concerts !
marge simpson|excuse me , i think i'm holding up better than you are .
marge simpson|in fact , i've got energy to spare .
marge simpson|i thought she gave you her rebellious spirit .
marge simpson|homie ?
marge simpson|it doesn't work that way , homie .

marge simpson|oh my god , he's out of frame !
marge simpson|zoom out !

marge simpson|are we ever going to find him ?
marge simpson|bart !
marge simpson|where are you , bart ?

marge simpson|those walls do look safe .
marge simpson|oh my god .
marge simpson|you've taught me a valuable lesson !
marge simpson|so i can't always be there for bart .
marge simpson|he's got to learn to take care of himself .

marge simpson|we were gone for two weeks !
marge simpson|i just made a thirtyseven hundred mile car trip .

marge simpson|now homer , boys will be boys .
marge simpson|where's bart ?
marge simpson|we're gonna be late for lenny's party .
marge simpson|bart simpson !
marge simpson|did you just spray water on me ?
marge simpson|dang that bart !
marge simpson|why can't our son just behave ?
marge simpson|that was unforgivable .
marge simpson|but i'm beginning to think that bart's bad behavior is more than just a phase .
marge simpson|no flicking boogers , and no driving into trees !
marge simpson|wow , lenny went all out !
marge simpson|bart , i've had it with you !
marge simpson|i'm taking away all your tv privileges .
marge simpson|okay , then videogames .

marge simpson|i made it with cheetos , just like you like it .
marge simpson|if the sauce is too thick , i can add more root beer .
marge simpson|maybe he's going through ...
marge simpson|certain changes .
marge simpson|homer , it's not a real paper it's a rubber chew toy !
marge simpson|it's cinnamon !
